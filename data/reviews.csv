  Got a new one yesterday and plugged it into my TV. Completed the initial setup steps like Language selection , Remote pairing and Wifi selection. The stick said it needed a software update and will reboot. Post the reboot, the stick would flash the initial startup logo and then just shutdown..Extremely disappointed with the purchase . Wish Roku had better QC in place.FINAL UPDATE 5/15/2019: Roku Support want me to ship this rubbish remote to them at my own cost and they will send a replacement. What these  ‘experts’ don’t seem to realize that the problem is inherent to the product and no amount of replacements is going to solve it. Maybe they should just look at Amazon reviews to see how many customers have had the same problem.UPDATE 12/12: I returned the stick for a replacement and had my fingers crossed hoping that this would just work but looks like Roku had other plans. The stick works (phew!) but the remote doesn't want to pair unless your 2 feet from the TV , which Roku should know, defeats the purpose of a remote control.UPDATE 12/18: Got in touch with Amazon who were wonderful in contacting Roku and ensuring that I got a replacement remote.Sadly the replacement remote worked fine the first day and had the same problem day two onwards.UPDATE 4/6 -  Multiple follow ups with Roku tech support has gone no where. Roku support keeps insisting I try and change the Wifi channel (non tech savy folks , if you are reading this, you should avoid this stick) and select one that is not congested. I tried doing that but the funny part is the Roku won't connect to those free channels (thanks for nothing Roku support!).I believe the product has inherent flaws which should have been fixed before the product was rolled out.The remote definitely has pairing issues , something which was not there in the older stick. Roku should acknowledge and fix this problem instead of sending replacement remotes.I really have lost all confidence in Roku now and will NOT buy anything from them ever again.

  I've never had a Roku before. This is well priced for what you get and the streaming is good quality. There are a few big caveats, though.The first is that Roku try to trick you into putting in a credit card. As you first sign up, the interface gives you no option to avoid this (!), but it actually isn't necessary to function. You have to stop your registration at the point they ask and restart the roku. Then, just log into the website. Works fine without the CC.  I guess marketing thought it was a good idea to force customers to give payment info.  It is kind of scummy.The second is that search is lousy.  Search within individual channels is awkward, and the main Roku search interface doesn't differentiate between movies on channels you already have, and movies on new channels they want you to subscribe to.  By mixing them all, they try to force you to sign up for more channels, I suppose, but it is at the cost of a easy to use search function.The third is that there is no general history or resume. If you stop in the middle of a movie there is no indication when you turn the machine back on of what you were watching or where you stopped. You have to remember to go back into whatever channel you were in, and look for the specific movie again.  Remembering current status is basic functionality, and the whole thing is made worse if you have more channels as Roku encourages.  Surely Roku could figure out how to resume properly. I purchased this for my elderly parents, all this lack of basic function makes their lives considerably more complicated. It is a shame, since those things would be so easy to do right and the streaming itself is fabulous.

  What an incredible little piece of equipment! Because the wifi pickup is in the wire that connects to the power, it balances on top of my TV, and because of that, I get my wifi through 3 walls of the house (wood frame house). The picture quality is, can I say, better than Cable? yes. The selection of endless movies, documentaries. I can scroll down through types of things I want to see. I am only paying for my PBS Passport station through a donation that amounts to $5/month that allows me into an amazing array of viewing. I get my local TV channel every evening for news. If I miss the news time, I can see it again at 9, 10pm, whenever.  We don't watch too much on broadcast tv, can't stand the 40 minutes of commercials sometimes and 20 minutes of show.  After checking out the Roku experience for 4 weeks, we are going to cancel all TV with Comcast. We do need them for internet, but we can use 55 mbps from them and it will accommodate all streaming.  I think we will save $100 to 140/month!!  So easy to use. The remote turns the TV on and off, one simple remote.  Nice.

  Loved it until it stopped working normally. Now i have to restart it everytime to watch. It would have overlapping screens, no way to watch unless i restarted the system everytime. It has been over 30 days and cant get a replacement because roku says to contact whoever sold it on amazon, but those people cant be contacted.

  This Roku Streaming Stick + has been a royal PITA since I first got it. First of all was the multiple instances in which I had to log in with a username and password just to get access to the various apps. I could understand being required to do this perhaps once for each app (to register for each service), but not multiple times for the same app. I am in the comfort and security of my own home on a password protected (automatic entry for all my devices ALL DAY EVERY DAY) wifi system. I am not worried about hackers or otherwise unauthorized use of their streaming service. Nor should Roku.Undoubtedly, the Fast Forward and Rewind functions are the most aggravating and infurating things about the service, or lack thereof. Both are either too slow or way too fast. And the 10 second rewind function (why no 10 second FFWD option-ignorant!) no longer works. It will freeze the picture and after a 10 second delay or so, it will pick up right back where you left off, with no rewind. And ostensibly, it should be additive, such that if I press this button 5 times, it will go back 50 seconds. But it doesn't do so. And trying to find your way back to a scene you missed for whatever reason is maddening. It takes the patience of a monk to endure the slowest rewind speed. And there is no rational progression beyond that for the next increments of FFWD or REW speeds. It goes into hyper drive on the second push, what is typically reserved for the 3rd or 4th press of the button. Moreover, I have encountered too many disruptions of service where the picture freezes during buffering. To top it all off, customer service is a nightmarish merry-go-round to get through.Don't waste your money. The Amazon firestick does not put me/you through any of this mess, delivers consistent performance, offers both a 10 second rewind AND forwarding function, does not make you log in multiple times (only had to do so twice; one other for Sling subscription initiation), has only frozen in buffering once or twice for less than 10 seconds each time and has a better interface (which helps you find the shows you'd be interested in quicker). Moreover, Amazon customer service is excellent and readily available for help. I had one instance in which I allowed their technician active X remote control. He quickly, quietly and politely resolved the problem. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ROKU DEVICE AS LONG AS I LIVE!!! I AM GOING TO STICK THIS POS ON A TV I RARELY USE, OR SELL IT TO SOMEONE ELSE AND LET THEM DEAL WITH IT!

  Been using this for about a week now and overall I am really happy with it, but becareful of overheating and bandwidth use if your ISP is capped (mine is capped to 1.2TB per month which I need for other stuff too besides roku)Because of the overheating I had to add a fan near it and it dropped the temp from 82c to 66c in the secret screen (see pictures)to access the secret screen to see the temp hit this remote key combo:Home, Home, Home, Home, Home, Fast Forward, Pause, Rewind, Pause, Fast ForwardFor the bandwidth control you will want to go into your Router Settings (see last picture) and enable Traffic Management (QoS) and adjust the downstream to just enough for the Resolution you want to stream at, for me I use 1080p, and 3mbps down is just enough for 1080p streaming and I been able to stay around 15 to 20GB a day (0.5 to 0.8GB per hour) (450 to 600GB per month)Another thing you can do to save bandwidth is go into Roku Settings > Privacy > Advertising and check the box on ""Limit Ad Tracking"" and then restart the roku stick to apply the settingHave fun, hope this review was helpful

  My first Roku I bought about a year ago. It just went out on me so I ordered a new 49.00 from amazon. When I went to set up on my Tv it gave an activation code and an error code when I tried to activate. A phone number popped up and I called it and it sounded like India. They said that there was a one time software update charge of 29.95 for her to activate my new device! And I would never have to do that again! I said absolutely not and took her name Tanya at Digistream I’m Tampa Fl.  Nothing in advertising about extra charges to activate! So I decided to get Roku customer service 816 272 8106. No longer working due to Covid! So I attempted to activate my device on tv again and this time I got someone who said they could activate but as of June they have to register new customers and it’s 200.00 for a year and 450.00 for 5 years!! I told her I’m returning this because it’s a scam and Roku is letting this happen. There is no customer support! DoNT BUY! This just happened to me on July 16 2020.  I'm still waiting to see my return is settled!

  I can't tell you how much I love this Roku compared to Amazon Fire Stick. It is AWESOME and so easy to use and set up. Everything from the packaging to the contents of the box is quality and I love that I don't need 14 remotes to watch streaming tv. Roku even comes with instructions to set it up, but really, it is so simple. You can go online and watch tutorials from Roku and so much more.I had two Fire Sticks and neither one worked with Hulu and the stick got really, really HOT when streaming live tv. I wasn't crazy about the quality of Fire Stick either, Roku is night and day and with so many more features.I read the reviews on Amazon by the guys who I felt really know what they are talking about when it comes to streaming and comparisons. When I read that CNET also recommends this fire stick I was sold, especially after all the problems I had with Fire Stick. I LOVE Amazon and Prime but the Fire Stick was a bust for me in so many ways.I am so glad to be rid of cable and their hideous bills for getting nothing to watch and a ton of aggravation. Optimum raised my basic cable bill $30.00 after 4 years of loyalty and I was DONE!! Streaming is the future and the way to go.I have a 3 yr old Samsung Smart Tv 1080P and this Roku stick works great plus I am ready in the event I decide to get a 4K tv. Don't hesitate a minute. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the Roku sticks.

  I'm SO glad I got this! 100x better than our fire stick. The picture quality is outstanding! We can get ALL the apps we were never able to before. The fire stick was so limited. We couldn't even get Vudu. And it's picture quality sucked. It would buffer too often. We have never, not once, had an issue with buffering with this Roku.(using the exact same internet and router) I only wish we would have made the switch much sooner! We love the free Roku channel on it.We will be getting another one now that we cut the cord on cable.I highly recommend!

  I purchased this streaming stick because I was having trouble streaming content to my Sony Blu Ray player (Netflix and Amazon Prime).  It was so painful to try to watch streaming content and I was searching the internet to find some sort of solution.  I wondered if my internet provider was not giving me enough data speed and I also wondered if my wireless router was getting too old, etc.  Enter the Roku Streaming Stick+!  Now, I can stream anything and no problem.  I was absolutely shocked on how good my streaming is now.  I went with the plus model due to the fact that it claimed to have a better wireless reception than the regular streaming stick.  I don't know if I really needed the plus or if Roku is just that good, but I can report streaming content is not a problem anymore.  Now the Sony only play DVDs and BluRay discs.  Definitely recommend this.  The only thing negative to report is you cannot surf the internet with this or at least I haven't found a way to do that.  I have Firefox on my Android phone and on Roku and I can't seem to get that to work at all either.  I'm not worried about that because I usually don't surf the internet on my TV but it would have been nice to be able to stream shows from the websites of major networks like CBS (can't stream the free content you can stream on your laptop).

  My ability to stream content was rather limited before I got this. I had a 1st gen Chromecast that was less than useful, and a Blu-ray player that could stream, but it enjoyed crashing and was limited in what it could do with modern streaming platforms.I decided on this streaming stick since it seemed simple, provided a lot of features, was a good price, and worked with a simple USB power interface.It was incredibly simple to install and setup. I think it would be extremely difficult to not make the Fire Stick not work correctly as long as you follow the steps it provides.I found the navigation to be very easy and logical. It was easily to get it working with my various streaming services. The quality of the streaming is excellent.I have yet to encounter a fault or problem. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to do simple multi-service HD streaming.

  We bought this as a replacement to our 1st generation Fire Stick that was just getting to where it wasn’t able to keep up and required cache dumps often just to function and was becoming progressively slower.I know this is a “lite” but it’s functioning power definitely isn’t. It’s amazingly quick and works well with all of our streaming services.Though slightly cumbersome to navigate with the remote the Amazon Silk web browser is also very quick and responsive.We have definitely been happy with this much needed Fire Stick upgrade.Apps we have tried:NetflixHuluDisney+LesMills OnDemandYouTubeSilk BrowserCrunchy rollPrime VideoAll of the above apps have worked seamlessly with this streaming device.Definitely a great investment for any television that does not have built in “smart” capabilities.

  O bought this item as My streaming  Blue Ray DVD player had very few apps it could access in case I wanted Disney+ or something more popular than Hulu and Pandora.  There was also the problem of running an attached wired cable to the back of the Blue Ray DVD  that ran along the floor of my office and constantly being tripped uponThe Firestick was easy to set up and within 15 minutes I was all ready to go and logged into my Prime Steaming service and Netflix .Although I had wanted this product, I also wanted to make myself familiar with the item soI can help some friends who also wish to get a Amazon Firestick They may go with the more expensive HD model but I now have some knowledge of how to set one up when the time comes.Pluses:  A short while after installing the device I get an email with tips and links to use to learn more about it.Cons:  Nothing to tell me how to shut it off.  I had to go online for the answers as I could not find anything in the small foldout instructionsAlexa commands must be exact,  For somne reason the word ""return"" did nothing and I had to instead use ""Home""I woulkd reccommend this item to a friend and I already have

  Every time I turn it on I have to unplug the power and plug it in again to reboot in order to get sound on my tv. I have 5-6 other sticks that function with no problem. This is the only Lite one I have. Poor. Also I hate the new UI.Works ok after rebooting until the next time you use it. So I guess that’s worth some star. I’m going to ditch this one.Update: I was impressed. Within minutes of submitting this review Amazon called. They are gathering info to track down the problem some people are having with audio or video issues. So I upped my rating.

  Alexa? Who needs Alexa? ""She"" misinterprets everything I say.I have a Samsung Smart TV.  I like the features on the Firestick better.I I have Sling TV. Sling works a LOT better on the Firestick than the Samsung.I also have Pluto. They work the same.I have no connection issues, and I like the ability to set the bandwidth, and also the captioning.It's a neat little unit, much easier to navigate than the Samsung TV,and works very well with my network setup.For what I paid, I'm extremely happy!If you can grab ""Firestick Downloader"", you can add THOUSANDS of channels, from all over the world.As it stands now, with Sling (Hollywood and Starz options), and a couple of free ""sideloads"", I have more TV than I can handle.  And I am a TV freak.Sure comes in handy in times like these. You can find something for everyone.Enjoy!

  Whoa.Firstly,  I am an Amazon/Alexa/Firestick fan. I have had MULTIPLE firesticks in the past 5 years, mostly due to adding TVs and needing the portability for summer camps etc.Secondly,  this is BY FAR the easiest setup of a firestick!! Holy Cow! Because I had a Firestick in the living room,  it recognized it, connected to the wifi (um....Without having to enter the $##@%% password) and used the other Firestick to add apps etc. A much loved (on my part) feature.Cons? Well. I knew what I was buying (this is stick #6 or 7),so no surprises qith the base features. However (and I'm not sure this is merely a ""lite"" feature) the Home screen has changed. No biggie, just an acclimation necessary.As for the ""no tv controls""....that was never an issue.My only [ONLY] issue? The extra tv button on the remote....I am such a creature of habit with muscle memory for remote controls...so I keep hitting the tv button when I mean to play/pause. Seriously,  thats a user thing, I shall adapt!All in all...if you have multiple Firesticks (like me), you plug it in, accept the cloning of the other settings and.....Bob's your uncle.Its the simple things!!

  After two weeks of use, it began to fail over a period of three days.  When I tried moving ports, restarting the TV, restarting the Fire Stick, etc. it would not boot up.  It was quite obviously dead.  I had heard how easy it is to return items to Amazon.  Not this item.It was very confusing to the very patient support person that *I* bought this, but someone *else* registered the device - my wife.  After 31 minutes on the phone, he agreed to send a new one.  Which works fine.  So far.  But I was instructed to send the defective item back, for refurbishment or quality control purposes.  When the replacement item came, I did not find a return envelope or an address label.A few days later, I asked my wife if she had seen the return label.  She had not, so I tried to get one without the hassle of the phone.  I gave up on that and called Support.  They called right back, were also (patiently) confused by the user not being the same as the buyer, and after 23 minutes, agreed to send (or re-send) the return label.  To the user, not the purchaser.  Tomorrow, the dead one goes back.So if *you* buy it, make sure *you* register it.  Perhaps the more expensive version of the Stick is also more robust.

  I'll always be a fan of the fire stick is my first introduction to a different way of watching TV after the antenna was taken outta the picture I'm still not used to this even after all these years but think of all the years I watched with an antenna way more years That than this way but yes Amazon is on it with this the difference between the lite and the regular fire stick besides there's a live TV button to press instead in I'm not sure yet. The smart TV we had died and this temporary old TV we have well this temporary TV think died because of the fire stick LOL  THE temporary TV was 5 years old and not a smart TV so until tax season I'm using my phone because I mean disability only goes so far but my honesty doesn't don't hook up to non smart TV's or to TV's 5 years of age or older LOL.. but yes Amazon fire stick is the only way to go. No extra anything for this either unless you want it. Other than that good good to go

  Let's be honest.  Who doesn't like the price?  But, the issues I am experiencing is crazy.  Not sure if it matters, but when I am done watching TV, I normally turn off the TV.  I know--what a phenomenon! When I go to watch TV again, I will turn on the TV (Lite does not have power button) and wake the Fire TV Lite.  Sometime it will not wake (gray screen).  Most times, it will wake and function BUT without sound/audio!!!!!!!  No SOUND!!!I then have to reboot the Fire TV Lite in order for the sound to come back! This is GARBAGE!

  This is a nice item to have but the upgraded version with volume control it much better. I'm giving this a 3-star rating only because I think Amazon is ripping off its customers by not offering a remote sold separately in case something happens to the remote.Unbeknown to me, my daughters remote got tangled in bedding and ended up going through the washer .There was absolutely nothing wrong with the fire stick itself, on the remote was fried. Buying a new remote by itself cost just as much as a new fire stick with remote so it made sense to buy all new everything. I was forced to buy an entirely new fire stick with remote.and am now stuck with a useless fire stick all because I can't pair another remote with it and it's cheaper to just buy a new fire stick remote.Come on Amazon!!!! you can do better than that with your customers!

  The home menu on this thing populates nicely as you add all your accounts and watch thigns. I like the list of recommendations it gives me and how it goes across some apps. Not ones like hulu. I imagine you give preference to those who pay you money so I don't blame hulu for being buried on this thing.Otherwise it's nice. I do have 4K in my living room but this is great for the bedroom.I don't use any of the voice crap so I can't review..

  Apparently I haven't experienced all firestick is after reading all these comments. As far as I am concerned I am loving my firestick. I dont care it has no tv controls on it. (It wouldn't have had the capacity to change to HDMI3 anyways only my TV controller does) Very very easy to set up. Mine was already attached to my home network. I didnt have to do anything extra.  I got the youtubetv trial and I am enjoying this. I should gotten this along time ago.

  I received on Thursday. Hooked it up. Everything worked well. Friday, everything worked. Saturday, everything worked. Sunday, no picture or menus. I know the trick of unplugging the power, waiting a few seconds, plugging it back in and letting in reboot. Tried that. Nada. Switched electrical jacks. Switched HDMI ports. TV still works. Roku still works. Nothing from Firestick. Dark screen. No menu. No Alexa. Took it upstairs to see if it would respond to a change of scenery. No dice that way either. It was on a surge protector. Just apparently a bad device. If you're reading, Amazon, how do you make good?

  This unit replaced an original Fire TV Stick from several years ago that had become painfully slow! What a difference! It is fast, clear, easy to use and works great! I really didn't need the voice remote feature and there is a Alexa Dot within a foot of the TV so I didn't need that feature either. But - I wanted a faster experience on our non-smart, kitchen TV where the old Fire Stick lived - this does the trick perfectly for not a lot of money!

  This is the 5th Fire Stick I have bought.  it was to replace the oldest one which was getting flaky.  The original remote suffered from being too symmetrical But this new one is truly stupid layout.  Doesn't Amazon have any ergonomics experts on staff???  You should at least do some testing of changes before applying them.  Luckily, one can pry off the ""Guide"" rubber button to get it out of the way.  Someone could make a lot with a ""filler"" plug.

  We have four tv's in the house, and this will be the second Firestick for us.  The voice remote is nice, as it's faster to search for a title than inputting the alphabet.  I like the way profiles can be created for different users.  I don't use the Alexa feature because Alexa, Siri, and Cortana are not welcome here.  Since we cut the cord to cable the Firesticks are what we use to stream all our shows.  We also have two Roku's and like them just as well.

  I have been watching more TV since I got this.  I enjoy the weird type of programs and this provides.  Being technologically challenged, I have not set up Alexa or any type of voice commands.  I enjoy the programming, so have no major complaints.  The only complaint is that every day I have to let it reboot before the audio comes on.  The video is no problem.  There’s just no audio until I reboot it.  My husband showed me what to do, so it’s no big deal for me ant more. Otherwise, I enjoy the programming on the fire stick.

  Even though this version did not come with the compatible option to change the volume of the TV, I love being able to see movies and shows that are free on Prime but are quite expensive and only available for rental on my cable tv. For now I will keep both because there are some shows that aren't available on Firestick but are available to me on cable. But I am truly loving the extra movies that I get to watch from my phone instead of trying to watch them from the miniture screen on my mobile devices.

  We love Amazon fire sticks so much that we have purchases three as well as one for my parents house. So easy to download several streaming apps to be able to watch anything you want. I’ve also downloaded the fire stick app for those times I can find the remote and I’m too tired to get out of bed to find it. Fire Remote app has been a life saver the time our kid hid two of them in her toy box until we found them weeks later. We’ve tried the competitors “remote” service and found Fire stick was much easier to navigate, download, search...ect, highly recommend!

  My only complaint for this item is the lack of an on/off button. I bought this as gift for my parents so it was a bit frustrating. Upon setting it up we realized they would need to use the TV remote to turn on and off before using the firestick. Maybe this was mentioned somewhere in the details and I somehow overlooked it?Regardless, the firestick works great but I was hoping to help them eliminate the need for more than one remote.I'm giving 2 stars because I wouldn't buy another of this style just for that reason.

  We bought this Roku about two months ago. It streams nicely. One big problem has come up. When you you navigate from one item to another after about three item it jams up and stop working for about 5 or 10 minutes. So we’re ever you end up when it jams your stuck on that movie or item. I would suggest you buy a different stick and this does not seem to have robust processing power to allow you to easily move around. I was very disappointed in this product. In the past Roku was the best but now I am stuck with one that is definitely not very good.

  This device works great, as long as you don't mind replacing the remote batteries every few days. For some reason they are drained with 2-4 days, depending on usage (confirmed by battery meter). From information available online, this is a longstanding issue and ROKU has no interest in resolving it. I complained about this issue thru chat support and was promised an email response, but after 2 weeks no response was forthcoming. Based on other reviews, it is unlikely I will ever hear from ROKU (if I am wrong, ROKU, respond to this review).

  This is our second steaming stick, for our spare bedroom. We've been using our first streaming stick for about 6 months. We replaced our very old (but still functioning) Roku when it wouldn't stream Disney+. We love our streaming stick. It loads apps like Netflix and Disney+ immediately. Navigating within the apps is easy and intuitive. We paired the remote with our TV, and now only use the original remote when we need to switch the TV input away from our Roku. We even took it traveling, and were able to quickly set up the hotel TV to stream our favorite shows.

  This works great for wireless connection and picture quality, but...1) The stick does not support IR (Infrared) communication. It will only use RF (Radio Freq) communication, so you are locked into using this remote (or a universal remote that supports RF). I watch more than just the Roku, so I need to change the input on my TV. The Roku stick+ will NOT allow you to do change input on your TV.2) Be aware, there is a scam! If you try to connect more than 2 Roku devices from your home and get the ""003 error"". If you call the number shown, they will give you some BS story about paying anywhere from $70 to $150 to get it connected. Hang up! Go to the settings on your Roku and reset the stick. It will give you a new valid ID.I returned the Stick+ and purchased the Roku Ultra. The Ultra supports IR and login via your computer to your existing Roku account when you setup your new Roku.

  RETURNING; Useless - literally.Still waiting for necessary HDMI extension to SHIP from Roku(!? almost 1 week...).Roku offers it for free which I guess would be nice, so why not have it in the package already? - especially since they were obviously prepared with an answer to what, I would extrapolate, is a not-uncommon issue of the ""stik"" being too large to fit in limited size HDMI plug-in area on/behind the TV?Instead, $50 paperweight - not for long...Amazon would be wise to offer the extender right along side;""Free"" from Roku is entirely irrelevant if you don't have it.Disappointed as this was our first forray into ""cut cord"", and this device - per extensive research- was our choice as it was otherwise rated well...

  It's such as amazon sham to depict the Disney quick button on the remote in all their images to only send you the original ESPN button on the remote which was their original set.  I wanted what was depicted which was the ""Netflix, Hulu, Disney, Sling""  what I got was Netflix, Hulu, ESPN, Sling""They should send you the correct remote that is advertised an option or which remote you want.  I'll be speaking with Disney that amazon is not sending people the Disney remote they advertise and paying Roku a lot of money for.

  I bought this streaming stick specifically to take with me when I travel. I stay in a lot of hotels and some of them don't have smart TVs. For the ones that do, I don't want them to store my credentials for streaming services.  Having read the reviews and thinking I had done my research, I was confident I made the right choice with the Roku streaming stick. It sounded ideal for my situation, but it turns out connecting to the hotel wifi is a disaster with this thing.I'll preface this with saying I'm an IT consultant and have an extensive background setting up many wireless devices. I've tried 2 different Marriotts in two different states and the method of connecting the device to authenticate simply doesn't work when it requires loading a webpage. I ended up having to connect my laptop to the hotel wifi, enable the hotspot feature, and connect the roku to that in order to work. In other words, I have to have my laptop on if I want the roku to work at all times. It's advertised as a standalone device that can do this by itself.What this device needs is a way to directly open the authentication webpage for hotel wifi directly in the roku interface instead of the method of connecting to the roku via wifi and trying to complete all the steps before the connection troubleshooter turns off the roku access point. It times out too quickly to finish the steps. I tried with 3 different devices: My laptop, phone, and tablet. Each time, the roku timed out the connection before the steps could be completed.I realize not all people are in my situation where they need to travel often. Connecting to your home network is easy and the device works well when it does connect, but having it advertised as working easily with hotel wifi networks that authenticate with a webpage is misleading. I'm planning on using a firestick instead for travel.

  Dont waste your money on this. After 2 weeks using it, the remote stop to works, i changed the batteries, worked for another week, then failed again. I was checking the status of the remote batteries from the Roku Home, and after change the batteries, were on 100%, one day after that, 89%, 5 more days, the remote was dead and they make you to buy a new control for the device.Also the amazon support request to send the device back to them, to check the device and make a refund of the money.After check on google about this matter, a lot of people have the same issue, so this means that amazon sell this devices know it that the device is deffected.Again, do not waster your money on this.

  For the money, Roku has the greatest palette of apps - HBOMax, Apple TV and so many more. However, they appear to have equipped this Streaming Stick+ with the cheapest, weakest WiFi receiver possible. We have high-speed Spectrum cable internet, and our router is right in the living room with our TV, about 12 feet away. All our devices (computer, iPad, phones, etc.) show full bars anywhere in that room, and the LG OLED TV itself has no trouble getting a strong signal on any other app - Netflix, Prime Video, etc.Yet the Roku stick, plugged into the HDMI port on the side of the TV, showed a weak connection of only 3 out of 5 bars, and buffered miserably upon watching. Moving the router within 5’ got us up to 4 bars and less connection glitches. Getting up to a strong 5-bar signal required moving our router RIGHT NEXT TO the TV.Unacceptable, period, for a 2021 WiFi-dependent streaming device...so cannot recommend.

  Most older TVs require an HDMI dongle  to connect because the Roku stick is too long. Recently Roku stopped supplying the dongle, and you have to contact them to get one. Eight days later I still do not have it (perpetually listed as ""Shipped"" perhaps because Roku cheaped out and send it via USPS). Unless you have a new TV, just be prepared to stare at the Stick in its box for a week or more before seeing it it even is a good product.Update: after nine days I got the dongle...which was defective (I tested on a second tv which did not need an extension: works without the dongle but not with it) ... back to roku requested a second dongle be expedited. Six days later nothing. If I could give zero stars just for terrible customer service.Update 2: another week and a half and the second extender arrives. It also does not work (tested on a TV and two computers). More time wasted on chat and Roku discussion board, with no useful information provided. I finally solved this buying an HDMI extender on my own (I just picked the first one coming up on an Amazon). Presto it worked. So in total about three weeks of time wasted (plus cost of extender which was supposed to be supplied).

  Lots of problems with function. I was really looking forward to Roku being better than our Fire TV sticks. A cousin talked Roku up so I bought one. I am not happy with it.First off, the remote fails to connect to the Roku stick EVERY TIME I USE IT. I have to carry the remote to the TV, take off the remote cover and push the pairing button several times to get it to work. I have paired the remote several times it does not help.Also, the Roku often gets the time alignment messed up -- sound and video do not match. The sound it a couple of seconds behind the video. To fix this I have to turn off the TV unhook the Roku. Reinstall the Roku and restart the TV. It's not a big deal, except that I have to do this a few times a week. This NEVER happens, or has happened with firetv sticks.I have contacted Roku support three times with no real help. They're very confusing on customer service and tech support. All done in emails. They have not been of any help thus far.I'm pretty disappointed in the Roku streaming stick plus. Wish I'd never bought it and had just reset my old firesticks before I bought it. After resetting the firetv sticks and reinstalling apps, these years old streaming sticks run circles around the Roku for less money.

  Wow. Loved the Roku at 1st. It worked great. Fast forward a few months... my son and I watched several videos- maybe an hour ot two. The unit cut off. We were perplexed. He went to reset it and it was hot, when I say hot, I mean REALLY HOT. We decided to let it be for the night. A few days later, we wanted to watch a movie so we tried to fire it up... NOPE, would not connect.  We tried all hdmi ports, we googled blinking lights and how to reset and error messages, etc. NOTHING worked.  We gave up. Now, about a month later, I decide to try again, even bought new cord and checked the TV for issues - still cannot connect to the thing. Very disappointed with this purchase. Thought we were going to do better with the Roku vs the firestick, but seems they both have flaws. So sad that I can't watch my show 😢

  Late last year I broke my 1080p tv. Luckily was able to get a brand new 4k tv a few months later. At first I thought since it was a 4k smart tv I could watch 4k movies. Man was I wrong. Learned only select devices can no matter the tv. So I knew it was time for a new Roku player (had a gen 1 so didn't look good even on 4k). After shopping around and asking questions I went with the Roku streaming stick+. I love it. It even makes non 4k movies and shows look amazing. For the price its so worth it. I was nervous at first because I read my 4k tv needed hdcp 2.2 hdmi outlets or else at best would be 1080p and I couldn't find anything in the manual and behind the tv to say it did. But found out through research my tv did.What is also nice is the fact its not a box, its a stick that goes into a hdmi port (rather then hdmi cable connecting the two) so less clutter on the shelf. Also you don't need to aim the remote directly at it to use it. You can be in front of a wall and it would work. So no need to worry about where you stick it in the tv (for me the hdmis were behind the tv and not on the side).  It is your typical Roku player, has the same apps as the first gen plus any 4k apps (there is a section for it). Also some of the apps (Netflix, hulu) looks completely different then their older model counterparts so had to get used to it.The remote is your standard Roku. Same set up with some very nice features. If you sync it to your tv you can turn off the tv without tv remote and even control the volume (volume controls are on the side) so makes it easier versus using two remotes. A very nice feature is audio control. Kind of like siri or alexxa.. You push the button and make a command to open an app or search for a movie, show or app.Overall the pros are great and cons are nothing to worry about. Id do some research before buying to make sure your tv has the right hdmi ports or else you spent more money on the same thing as a cheap model for non 4k tvs. Defiantly recommend.Pros:-amazing picture for both 4k and hd-No box-don't need to aim remote at device-price-remote features-voice controlCons:-needs a specific hdmi for it to work-some apps are different then the ones on other Roku models

  I've owned multiple Roku devices over the years.  I took a chance on the stick and regret the purchase.  This seems to be powered by a combination of wall plug and USB port.  It starts very slow.  After watching for twenty minutes, it delivers a low power warning and will no longer work.  USB etc is providing power, the device status light is properly illuminated.  I suggest you skip this particular product and buy one of the higher quality Roku devices.  Alos, this device is not portable.  If you travel with it and plug it in, you get stopped with a notice that the device can only be used in your home where you first registered it.  Not consumer friendly.

  Weve had Rokus for years.  This one is great as well, minus 1 major problem.  It drains batteries within 2 weeks or so with very little use.  You'd be spending plenty in batteries over 1 years time.  Roku failed. The remote must be ""looking"" for the roku when the TV is off, I cant think of any other reason why the batteries would drain. I have a replacement coming, so we will see if the issue is persistent.Update: Got the  new roku stick from Amazon, thanks to their great return policy. Unfortunately it was not a defective issue. Again same problem. The remote kills batteries within a week with little use.  Solution? I thought I would move on without the remote and just download the roku app to use my phone as the remote.  STILL A FAIL!  The app will not ""see"" the Roku stick, and it wont even connect manually using the IP address.  What a joke.  Come on Roku, the user interface is the most important part of the device.  If I dont have a remote control, how can i use it?

  I purchased for an older Polaroid flat tv used in a bedroom and had issues from day one.  I always assumed the issues stemmed from the older tv, not the Roku. At first I was able to unplug the tv, let stand ten minutes, and it would start up just fine with access to Roku apps.  I would need to do this unplug routine each time, finally that work around stopped working all together.  I changed the Roku batteries a number of times.  During this time, the tv itself was clearly getting power. Finally, after a little over two months of minimal use, I placed the tv in the garage for garbage and gave the Roku to my son.  This Roku is an upgrade for the one that he has because he's able to control the volume and such. After hooking the ""new"" Roku up, it did not work for him either. His tv is not even a year old and never had any issues with the older Roku. We quickly determined it wasn't my older tv that was the issues but the Roku itself. Unfortunately at this time, I no longer have the packaging and for all I know, it's past it's return period anyways.  Going forward, I will purchase in person at a box store.

  This was my third Roku device purchased.  Up until now I was extremely happy and would highly recommend Roku to all of my friends and family.  I was having difficulty with the Roku that was in my bedroom mainly because my room is located at the furthest location from my wi-fi so I decided to try the streaming device with the long-range wireless.  I received the device and set it up just like the others, put in information, etc.  At this point I was given a code to enter online to activate my Roku, which I did and was given a phone number to call to assist.  I did this and here is where the problems begin.  For the first time ever from Roku, I was given the hard sell.  I had told them that I had Spectrum and the customer service rep began telling me about how I could pay them a one time $100 fee to get 500 channels or $150 to get 1000 channels.  I said ""no thank you, just activate my device.""  Pressure continues.  I finally said that I'm not giving out my credit card number and I have never had to with my 2 previous roku devices.  He finally activates it.  Still trying to sell me the other channels.  I say ""no thank you"" a final time then hang up.  A short time later my device has been deactivated and here is the worst part, ALL OF MY DEVICES HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN!!  I'd like to give them another chance but as of right now I am a very DISSATISFIED customer!

  I'm posting this review mostly to document my experience with Roku support.  I have three of these in my home, and am pretty happy with how they work.  Recently, one of them ""bricked"", not sure if it was due to an update or just hardware failure (after about 7 months of use).  Went on Roku and did chat-based support.  It took about 30 minutes to walk through the hard reset, restart, etc. steps with the rep that I had already done.  When we got to the end of the process, the rep sent me an RMA number and address to mail my Roku stick to.  A week, later, I got a replacement.  Bottom line, the company stand behind its product.The product hasn't really changed, although I did notice that the remote now has a ""non-slip"" type finish as opposed to the slick glossy finish my previous remotes had (which is a little nicer).  Yet to be determined if the remote eats batteries as quickly as the old one.Other than the remote's battery consumption, my only complaint as a multiple device owner has to do with setup.  When activating the Roku, I have to go through the whole ""channel selection"" setup again, which is kind of annoying.  My devices are registered with Roku, and they should know what I use.  It's also painful to have to re-register each channel (Hulu, Netflix, etc.) but I'm guessing that is because of ""differences of opinion"" in how registration should work (i.e. does Hulu trust Roku to act as an authentication proxy).

  I was really happy with my Roku stick + at first. I'm still happy with the Roku but the remote is quitting on me bit by bit. It worked fine at first but then the Back button (the one by the OK button) stopped working. Now this week the Up button stopped working. I'm wondering if the Next button and the Down one will stop next.I've looked all over their site and the Roku tips and troubleshooting channel and can't find anything that addresses this problems. I changed the batteries. I reseated the batteries multiple times.I tried re-pairing the remote to the TV. I have tried every remedy I could find and not only do none of them work but it's slowly getting worse.I would have rated this quite highly if not for the remote issue. I've ordered one of their HDMI extender cables but somehow I don't have a lot of faith in it working either. I've only had this since July which seems really soon for the remote to stop working right. I wonder if they just expect me to order a new remote every 6 months or so.PS  I wrote this but got distracted and never submitted it. The remote suddenly started working the same day the extender arrived. Since it was here, I went ahead and connected the extender anyway, even though the remote was now working again. All went well for a while but today the remote went on semi-strike again.Not only can I not use the up or back buttons near the OK button again but now when I try to operate the remote, it randomly goes to a window asking if I want to add ESPN. (For the record, I definitely do NOT.) I tried rebooting and now it wants me to sign into my internet account, something I can't do because the remote won't move the cursor up or back.For the record, I have a Roku Ultra in the living room and it works great. For that matter, when the remote feels like working, the Stick is great too. The thing is, however, that if you can't count on it to work, the Stick is useless. I'd return the thing if I weren't past the return date. If you want a Roku, pay extra and get the Ultra. Don't waste your money and sanity on this version. Seriously, run away fast and hard from it.

  I got fed up with The constant “low storage” notifications from my Fire TVs and decided to try a Roku. After setting it up I immediately bought 2 more and ditched all my Fire TVs. Overall experience is a bit cleaner since you’re not constantly beaten over the head with Prime Video recommendations and banner ads. The app sign in experience seems better overall and the companion app is a huge step up over FTV. The private listening feature is an unexpected winner for me, it allows you to shift the audio from the Roku to your phone which is great for late night viewing.

  I bought this for my grandma because her cable bill was ridiculous! Her favorite channels and shows were costing more. Now, she can watch all her favorite shows as a decent price and I can support her with any technology issues she may have. It’s pretty simple to navigate and it only took a little while to introduce the process. It also helps that there is Alexa attached because of my grandmas poor eyesight, it helps to just say what she wants done!

  Set up the Fire Stick Lite for my bedroom TV. I already have a Fire Stick on the Family Room TV and enjoyed using it.  After setting up the Fire Stick Lite using the provided plug and cable. Using the HDMI Extension cable to keep away from the TV, the Stick tends to over heat causing the it to glitch or shut down.

It really opens up excellent streaming functions and all with simple voice commands.  Great product!

  The lite version isn’t anywhere near as good as the new firestick with the built in volume controls. We need to manually reset the lite version to get the sound to work every single time we use it the next day. The one with the volume built in controls the TV power and the volume on the sound bar. I wish I’d bought two of the one with sound included but now they aren’t on sale and it’s too late to return the lite.

  My first Roku early last year was the ""express"" stick. It was far better than my FIOS service in choices picture quality, options and value. To be honest I was amazed and wished I had made the move to a Roku sooner! I would have enjoyed netter TV, and saved a LOT of money. Still it occasionally had some buffering on the wireless as my TV is a fair distance from my router. After I did several hours of research I decided the best value would be the RoKu Stick Plus. Wow! I hoped it would be a lot better, but I didn't expect a quantum leap in every category! Oh MY GOD! It's incredible! Even more free TV! More choices! More movies! More quality! MUCH faster! No buffering even when all my kids are gaming online! Just WOW! I cannot recommend this device highly enough!

  I already have LG smart TV with its default OS. Even though it has fancy stuff like cursor, the connection was a nightmare. I always need to connect to Wifi manually and netflix gets disconnected multiple times making TV watching a bad experience. Since it is a big screen, I thought I'd go for the top stick option.Installation was a breeze. Remote is simple and easy to use. Interface is just perfect. Smooth, fast and simple UI experience. No issues with any apps I've used so far. Not sure about the advantages of this item vs other sticks from Roku. But Roku stick, any type/model, is definitely something you should invest in if your TV OS isn't good or slow.

  Roku is definitely the way to go if you're interested in cutting the cable tv scene. Have been using a new Streaming Stick + for a couple of weeks. Setup was reasonable, adding channels as well. However periodically, sometimes more than once a day, the remote stops functioning. This can range from zero function to volume up/down is the only thing working. Having to power off the Roku, remove batteries, wait briefly, and start back up. Have not gone through a re-paring the power off/battery out has been working.Still believe this is the device I want. Will be trying a re-paring setup again.This would all be 5 stars if the remote wasn't flaky.

  The Roku Stick+ has enabled my Viszo m70-3c Tv to be worth a darn.  I bought that TV 2.5 years ago and if never worked well - crappy app interface, no Disney+ app (even a year after launch), PLEX didn't work, and the Sonos speakers sounded muted.  However, once I plugged the Roku Stick+ in all that changed and I am left with a wonderful User Interface, great sound management and the Disney+ App.  this piece of equipment saving our TV and it is now a place we can watch our streamed content (we don't have cable TV).

  I decided to cut the cord.  I bought this along with the Apple TV 4K.  I have returned to Apple TV.  This little thing is a beast.  It streams virtually every service available and does it without issue.  The interface is simple.  The remote on the Roku+ is awesome in that it also controls your TV and volume.  So, you now have this one little remote to literally everything if you have cut the cord exclusively.  Also, through the app on the phone you can stream pictures, videos, music from your phone (which is frankly the main reason I bought the AppleTV for ease of streaming from my iDevices).  I would buy this again without hesitation, and I have done so for the TVs in my other room.

  Bought this for vacations after I lost our older version (sorry hunny!).(SKIP down if you already own a Roku).  All Roku devices have essentially the same setup, menu, and features.  It’s very easy to get started, find apps, and navigate.  It has minimal advertisements and less “in your face” suggestions as compared to an Apple TV.  We are an Apple family and have switched to AppleTV twice...then promptly went back to Roku.  Unfortunately Roku’s search is still a mess and more-or-less useless.The only issue we have with Our Roku’s (we use 3 different versions of them scattered through the house) is sound quality.  If you stream through a high end home theater system, be aware that Roku and PLEX do not support much more than basic 5.1 channel surround.  This is a problem for audiophiles but no biggie for others.(ABOUT this Roku vs others)-  we bought it for traveling.  It plugs into hotel TVs easily.  Make sure to call the hotel’s tech support and they will register the Roku’s MAC address (found on the back of the Roku stick) so it will connect to WiFi.Finally the remote can control your TV. This has been a common complaint for some time now and I’m so happy it’s finally an included feature.  This makes it easy for the kids to navigate the hotel TV and we don’t have to use the nasty public remote.The only con, and it should be expected, is speed.  The Roku sticks are ALWAYS slower than the Roku boxes in our experience.  If you’re going from Roku Ultra or even a Roku 3 to this you will notice everything takes about twice as long to load.  Menus are still responsive and navigation is fine but actual loading times is noticeably slower.Still the best “cord cutting” device out there vs FireTV/AppleTV/etc.  This is also a worthy upgrade over the older streaming stick with the improved video quality and universal remote.Update:  We took it to Disney and did not have to register the MAC address.  We just plugged it in, selected the WDW guest WiFi, and away we went.  Bonus that WDW uses Samsung tv in their rooms and we have one at home so I didn’t even have to program the remote.

  I have an older model Roku which works fine, but when I moved it to a TV in an upstairs bedroom, it could not connect to my wi-fi.  I thought about upgrading the wi-fi, but in the meantime, searched the newer Roku models and found this one which promised better wi-fi connectivity.  And it delivered!  It works perfectly in the far upstairs corner of the house and I am thrilled to be able to expand TV choices in that room.  Great buy and works great.

  I am learning to use wifi streaming and a Roku was recommended. Setting it up was actually very easy and I did have to request help with a code and the Customer Service was patient and very helpful, excellent service. She also madevitbperfectly clear that the service is totally free and Roku will never ask for any fees or charges.I am frustrated with the Voice recognition, it continually says it does not understand what I said. I speak perfect English, and speak slowly and distinctly, then when it finally and rarely understands, ( like one word commands) ie:” news, ” it sends me off in the wrong direction. I just use the letter search instead.

  I bought this November 2019. I've replaced the remote batteries last night for the third time. I've had to unplug and reset the device at least 10 times over this period. At least 2 or 3 times a week it just shuts off without explanation. On top of it's technical failures, the platform is not nearly as easy to use as Fire Stick from Amazon, and really could use an update. The worst part of the device is how incredibly slow it is. I also bought a ROKU TV, which I find is much faster. On average it takes at least 4 minutes to get this running sometimes longer, sometimes it just freezes.

  Item is defective. Constantly shuts off volume and requires a system reboot. Won’t allow you to exchange as described. Makes you go in circles when you request the exchange once purchased, then requires you to talk to an agent... THEN Customer service blows and requires 21 troubleshooting questions as well as your address and CC info to request an exchange. Do NOT buy from this vendor. Shady as f***.

  It’s great but I thought it was the hands free because I was told so. Come to find out that it’s not but I used it for about three days and then gave it to my parents because I bought the fire tv cube which is hands free. I love it!

  This fire stick really kicks other smart tools I've used in the past such as Chromecast. For example, Chromecast will only let you cast into the tv... and that's it, however, Firestick has a pretty UI with apps and even games.Everything is really smooth to use and Alexa's voice recognition is a beauty. Say anything and Alexa will look for it. Once again this is the best option to make your TV into a smart TV.*I used on my RCA smart TV because there is no way it can compete with the firestick.

  I'm a low-tech old lady with Lyme Disease and did NOT mean to get Amazon Prime and have little use for this item. Tried a few times to figure it out but didn't get far. A friend helped me at least use it once, but I'm out of touch with movies even (and more so tv), so didn't like the selection much. Wanted to see the Tom Hanks movie about Mr. Rogers but not available without paying mucho. Watched something the system SAID was a comedy, My Uncle Frank, and it was not even remotely funny. During these Sad Times I so need humor.

  This Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite was a gift to enable streaming on an older non-smart TV, and for that function it has been outstanding.  The menus leave much to be desired, but the voice remote can be surprisingly good (I have not tested Alexa compatibility).  Setup is fairly simple. As an inexpensive route to stream, the Fire TV Stick Lite has performed admirably and, thus far, reliably.  I intend to update this review once I explore more options

  I have own Toshiba Fire tv for almost a year when we purchased Disney+.  Disney+ worked for us one month and then it stoped working.  We can watch Disney + on our computer but not on the tv.  So customer servicetold us that our Toshiba tv was no longer supported and recommend a roku device or fire stick.  I bought both the Roku and Firestick.  The Firestick did not work on neither the smart tv or the old tv, but the roku works on the existing smart tv and old tv.  I get error code 41 as of 11/27/20.  They may need to update the software.

  Great product! The only thing I would change is adding a power button. I have tried to google to see if this remote might have a power button like the home button or something but nope, other than that I’d say don’t lose the actual tv remote 😂 but great for a heads up if you are expecting a power button like the other fire stick!  Works great, voice recognition is 5/5 stars.

  Absolutely useless to watch live tv. All “live “ tv apps are  unavailable. Bought it to work on our older 2015 Samsung tv since sling app won’t work on it. Fire tv  says it’s unavailable.

  The Fire TV Stick Lite is inconvenient!! HATE IT!!No on/off button. To turn on or turn off tv you have to pick up remote, hold ""microphone"" button, and tell Alexa what you want. Any verbal commands require holding the the ""microphone"" button. But 'microphone"" button does not work for audio. You must use your tv's remote to control volume and mute.Totally my mistake for not reading the package. Threw the ""Lite"" stick away and bought the Fire TV Stick with the necessary buttons.

  My 2018 Samsung smart TV wasn’t as smart as it needed to be.  I switched to AT&T TV for my service provider.  The AT&T app was not on that TV and I could find no way to add it.

  I rarely give 5 stars, but this one rates it I believe.  I just recently purchased a Samsung 4k tv and wanted a compatible streaming device.  The setup is a cinch.  Automatically detected my screen resolution and 4K settings (Also gives you additional choices if you wish)  The picture is stunningly clear and the audio channeling through my sound bar is excellent.  Took just a couple of minutes to log into Netflix, etc and away we go.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting  the latest tech, and to those who have 4k capabilities.  The $70 price tag is definitely worth the investment.

  I'm a Roku fan, think the interface, the remote, and capabilities are first rate. But with this particular product, playback of media that has subtitles is a real problem.  The subtitles will either disappear or lag seriously against the on-screen dialog.  This is not a problem when connecting directly, wired, to either the smart TV or a wired Roku box.

  The Roku is easy to remove from the packaging and set up to my tv. Takes a full minute to turn on and load. Often the first buttons I press when turned on do nor register. The screen is user friendly and uncomplicated. I love that my remote is used for the tv volume. Streaming quality is OK only, at times the image clarity us poor or a show may pause. Overall, happy with my purchase.

  I have tried other streaming devices and after buying a ROKU TV, I decided to try a ROKU stick for my other large screeen that is not a smart TV.  Between the choices, features and price for my stick- voice recognition on the remote at a price of 29.99 the choice has turned out to be unbeatable.  In addition anyone who streams has suffered buffering or freezing of your program.  I have experienced that ROKU does a better job of holding the stream and recovering than Chromecast.

  This unit has worked fine for 2 months. Two weeks ago started having slow internet issues. Checked wireless speed each time and over 100Mbs so not the network.  Now the unit is freezing and/or turning off.Winter in New England and plenty of ventilation around unit. Disappointed. I have two other Roku units but not this new 4K version. Maybe a design/heat issue.

  I like that it gives a lot more options than what my smart TV gives.  I was hoping that it would pull in the signal better, but i'm not sure that it does.  Signal strength is certainly as good as the TV, but i'm not sure it is much better.  it is close.The apps and the remote are very responsive.  I do not use voice commands with it.. That just seems wrong to me.For the price, I'm very happy.  If you don't have a smart TV, this is the ticket.

  Can I rate this zero stars?  Or negative stars?  It doesn't work.  It takes 20 minutes for it to come on.  Until then it flashes like a strobe light.  I bought it to access HBO Max, which I'm paying for with my HBO account.  But, though Amazon advertised having the agreement with HBO to do this, I find no app to allow that.

Sure wish I had bought the stock as soon as it went public.

  Really glad I got it. Only hiccup was Netflix stalling out, and had to unplug and restart. Other than that, Roku is incredible. Got it over Amazon stick because Amazon is all about pay this pay for that, but Roku has so much to offer like freebie channels. Main reason was to get Showtime to play without paying for it through Amazon, because I already have an account. Amazon is lacking in so much lately it's almost embarrassing be cause they have trillions to spend. Roku will always be supreme!

  Works quite well and easy to set up. I mainly only use it for NBA league pass and YouTube.I find the arrow pad on the remote a little difficult to use mainly because I'm used to this part of a remote being lower down so I can't always find the arrows by feel and have to look to make sure i have my finger on the right button. Once I have it in place though, it's fine.I also find some of the preset buttons a bit pointless because I don't use Sling, Hulu or Vue so these serve no purpose to me. Maybe these buttons should be programmable shortcuts?NBA League pass works really well. The interface isn't as clean as AppleTV and there is a little lag when switching between days to view games but this is only a minor thing.Once you select the game to play, it loads quickly and streams at the highest bitrate setting. It's easy to navigate through the stream but I wish the right arrow skipped 10 seconds without pausing the video and bringing up the time slider. Because it pauses the stream, you have to press the right arrow and then press enter so make it play which creates an extra step. This is annoying when watching a game a few hours after it has finished as it makes it tedious to skip through breaks in the game.YouTube works well and pretty much the same as on any smart TV. The only things I don't like (navigating, non-qwerty keyboard etc.) are due to the YouTube app itself, nothing to do with the Roku.Overall it's a great little device and works well for what I use it for (mainly NBA League Pass). Would probably give 4.5 or even 5 stars if the navigation of a stream was smoother as mentioned above.

  I've had this remote for just a bit over a year - it's not overused (I use another TV a lot more ) so I was surprised to find that the remote just stopped working!  There was some odd, honey-like substance in the battery compartment - I removed the existing batteries, cleaned the compartment and installed new batteries.  Still not working. Checking with friends who also have had issues with breakdown after only a year's use.  I think ONE YEAR is carrying 'planned obsolescence' a bit far.

  The Streaming Stick+ is a great product but has a bad habit of freezing up. The TV will be playing a show and then the image will suddenly freeze in place. When reviewing Roku user forums the freezing problem seems to have been around for years and apparently Roku has not yet resolved the technical problem. The Streaming Stick+ gets five stars when it works and, of course, zero stars when it doesn't.

  I was able to hook this up myself. If you have problems unplug everything and start over. Check the date on the batteries in case the Roku control doesn't work. Also read the instructions exactly. If you take shortcuts and don't follow every step it will take longer to set up because you will miss a step. Don't get frustrated if you do mess up. Just start over and before you know it you will be watching your favorite shows.

  I didn't know what to expect with ROKU, only knew I needed it to stream HULU since my 'smart' tv was no longer up to the newest technology.  ROKU was a breeze to install,  easy to follow instructions.  There are so many links to free TV stations with movies and series.  Best purchase that I've made in a while.  Most definitely recommend it.

  This product is not as reliable as the old models (one of which I have had for 5 years).  If the wireless connection is interrupted (uh - power blips), it does not connect as easily.  It has a propensity to display ""not connected"" and ""Missing advanced wireless receiver"" messages when this happens.  Am keeping it as a back up, but am buying the Roku Ultra.

  Ya tenía servicio con roku, pero tengo mucho problema de internet en mi hogar opte por Fire TV stick Lite y al parecer utiliza menos internet ya que ahora puedo utilizarlo y tiene muchas aplicaciones o alternativas para ver. Además no tienes cables ni pegamento sólo una entrada HDM y listo. En verdad lo recomiendo 100%

"

  Having a Roku in addition to a smart TV is a little redundant. The remote control is also buggy at times... The roku itself is plugged in behind the TV and half the time I would have to hold the remote up behind the TV to get it to turn on. Not sure why there needs to be line of sight for this to work.

  
"

  The original HD streaming stick was already good, but this one is even better is that it can also do 4K videos and streaming. The remote is also better is that it can aim anywhere and still operates the channel.  Funny thing is, it also turns on my TV in the other room.  How powerful is that? Not sure if that's a feature or...anyway, get this thing.  You won't regret it.

  Overall, it is a good remote with nice system.  The one big thing is that you have to hit the up arrow hard or twice for it to engage.  I even sent one back and got a replacement.  Both did the same thing.

  In my opinion this is leaps and bounds better than the 1st gen Firesticks that I've had for a few years. Not sure how it compares to Apple/Nvidia but there's a significant cost difference between this and those options. So far so good, no choppiness or skipping like the Firestick (unrelated to internet connection). Everything is more fluent and just works, no bugs etc.

  I am sure that one day the ROKU unit will be good for Australia however as of today...You cannot play local content at all.None of the commercial stations (7,9,10,SBS and ABC) apps can be loaded.Voice control doesn't workNo search function which means you have to look through 100's of channels to find that what you are looking for isn't available.No KayoNo HuluNone of this is the fault of the seller.The parcel was delivered incredibly quickly direct from the USA to Australia (less than a week)Goods arrived in good condition in a padded bag.thanksDamon

  Don’t really use voice recognition much.  Like the Roku remote quality and roku menu software.  Own three Roku Streaming Stick +.  Have good quality internet connection, one being in the garage.  Great product.  Also have 3 fire sticks.  Prefer Roku except for side load on firestick for more app selection.

They told me to try swapping out the HDMI cable, even though I had already done so.The issue continues and the warranty is only for 1 year.I have bought 3 total Rokus and will update my review if those go out as well.

  This product is okay but I think the flow and the look of the Firestick is better. The one thing I do like about Roku is the Roku channel. What I don’t like about the Roku is the remote is cheaply made or at least sounds like it when I’m pressing the buttons.

  Scammers DO interfere with the activation process. To prevent this, you need to set up an account with Roku before trying to activate your device, AND read the directions which state there is no activation fee and BEWARE of Scammers.

  I won't bother to review the streaming stick itself, as other reviewers have already done a great job; I just want to point out two huge issues with the Roku remote: you can power your tv on/off and control volume, but there is no Mute button! Seriously?! I also wish that the shortcut buttons for Netflix, Sling, Hulu, and Vudu could be reprogrammed with your own favorite apps. I don't use a single one of those services. I have a workaround for the Mute button: use the Roku app on your smartphone. Turn your Media volume to ""off"", then press the Headphones icon (private listening) to mute. A bit of a pain, but at least it keeps me from having to use the TV remote for the sole purpose of muting.

I moved the stick to a smaller set in my bedroom and it performs extremely well. The problem might have been caused by something I did but I can't imagine what it may have been. I ordered a ROKU Premiere for the larger (55"") set and it is working great.The product was shipped right away and arrived in perfect condition but because of the problems I had with it's performance on the larger screen I can only give it 3 stars.

  I ordered both this and a Chrome-stick. The Roku was much easier to set up and get streaming services going. I still have the Chrome-stick and occasionally use it for Youtube videos, but find that the ROKU is much easier to deal with

  Purchased this so we could keep up with shows while on extended vacations, and to ensure we were prepared for rainy days with our 3 and 5 year olds. Compiled this into a case with HDMI adapters so they're all together & easily dropped into luggage for travel. Highly recommend!

  After returning 2 refurbished Roku 3's that didn't work right, I ordered this new streaming stick.  I wanted the private listening feature that Roku 3's offered, but this is resolved with the streaming stick as I downloaded the Roku app and listen through my android phone, works great.

  What more do I need to say.  It plugs directly into the TV, using the power directly from the TV. It does come with a power cord for external plug in. I chose to not use external plug in. This way I don't have to turn on individual devices.

  Was forced to upgrade when switching from Sling to DirectTV Now (my old Roku sticks weren't compatible) and was a little bitter, but oh my, the quality of stream is soooo much better with the new sticks.  Worth the cost of the upgrade!  I've been using the Roku for 2 years now and I love it!

  Received product on Feb 27, 2020.  Volume and mute quit working on May 3, 2020. The on and off controls and channel selection work fine.  What can be done about my problem?  The return policy ended on March 25, 2020.  Product was obviously defective.  Please contact me asap.

  This item while providing the means to access content that I want, it doesn't do it at all well.  It is extremely slow and the remote seems to drain batteries very quickly.  The UI is also pretty poor and not at as good as my Dish network remote for accessing NETFLIX for example.  I wish there were some clear alternative which I'll look for in future.

  I bought 3 of these for my tv's and outside theater. Forget Firestick and Google Chrome-- those adversariest don't like to support each other's content. Roku works with everything. This unit has great range and volume control built in, so you can toss the tv remote.

  I like how little to no space this thing takes up. It does take a little while for me to have control once it’s on. I press the Netflix button two or three times, then 5 minutes later it goes to the Netflix home screen. I don’t know why it does that. Nothing other than that. Good little device.

  I have a Samsung smart TV but hate how the apps take a while to load, not all apps are available and also the Samsung remote. Enter Roku stick. Between this and a Chromecast, everything is covered.

  No smart TV? Not a problem. This takes care of that. Highly recommend. Slight 1 time additional cost to go to the voice command model worth it.

  Good but could be better. I love the new remote but I only bought this to use with Plex thinking it's newer so it must be faster that my Roku premiere but I was wrong.

  I have an older version without voice recognition that works fine (at another location). This version has a mute button on the side that activates too easily when remote picked up-workable but annoying.  Though it was just the way I held the remote but has happen to 2 others while selecting a channel.

  Get any other model. If your power cord goes out you HAVE to get their special cable or the entire thing does not work. Only had mine 6 months and the cord has gone out. New cord is 20% Of the price of a new stick. If I had known I couldn’t use other power cords I never would have gotten this model.

  I love the Roku. Product works very well, no complaints.

  I use the streaming stick on the smart TV in the bedroom.  I was concerned that it may not work because our wi-fi is so weak, but luckily it does. It's perfect for my needs and it was a breeze to install.

  Bought this because I had other Roku devices and they were great. This device overheats and the sound cuts out. I want him to send me a replacement!!

  I choose this after I bought a Fire stick that didn't had keys to control TV volume and Power. i'm a bit disapointed because it can control the volume but it doesn't have a mute key.It only works with power plug on the wall. and it loads kinda weird.

  This device is just what we wanted.  We have a tv in our sunroom on the back of the house and didn't have access to a cable box, so this was the ideal solution.  We stream live with our cable service without having to get another cable box.

  We use this on our tv in our living room, it’s on older LED model, not a Smart TV like we have in our bedroom. I can stream all the same channels I stream in my bedroom, it was easy to set up and have been streaming shows every night since we got it!

  After three years, I replaced older device with this. Set up was almost thoughtlessly easy. No hassle. Impressed.

  The remote drains batteries and dies after barely any use. I replaced the remote with a completely new one and it’s the same issue. Very annoying — would not recommend and wish I just got a full refund.

  Even with a 4K tv, the change in resolution is negligible. I hardly notice a difference. One issue I have with this roku that I didn't have with the other is the video skips, audio goes out, and I need to reset the Roku unit on a regular basis. Pretty frsutrating. The volume adjustment on the remote is a bonus.

  One week down with “cutting the cord”!  Love it with the Roku. It’s not like cable but our “cable” bill is now $45 per month and not over $200 and we have very fast internet. Comcast..... suck it!!!

  I love this Roku stick, my grandkids love to watch PBS kids on it and I love that I can go right to DisneyNOW or Hulu, etc. I also love Roku TV, they have some great movies! It’s so fun, we’re really enjoying it, it’s well worth the money!

  This Roku streaming stick has really expanded our choice of available  shows.  The only thing we don't like is the number of advertisements.

  My wife wanted to be able to watch TV while cooking in the kitchen.  I had originally purchased a digital antenna, after trying it out and only getting 5 pixelated channels, we returned it and purchased this.  She loves this.

  Sometimes the tv will not produce sound and the fix is to unplug the fire stick.  Slightly annoying . Could find no relevant information on why or how to remedy it.
