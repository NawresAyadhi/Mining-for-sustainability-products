  The features I have on my 2017 unit have changed. There are no longer some channels that were available freely,  now cost.  It seems as though that midstream news or Euro originated TV shows are not available.  This has become the USA  propaganda biased network.  Do not buy unless you are the archetypical braindead citizen.

  First of all, this is the lite.. But let's get real here. Do we actually need seperate buttons for Netflix, Disney or Hulu just to pay more? No. The lite does not have those extra buttons but who cares. It still has Alexa voice and super easy to use.1. It's heavy duty remote yet small. Definitely can with stand a fall but the gorgeous sleek design is perfection.2. No it doesn't have the Netflix button, or a volume button. But since my volume stays at one level all the time that does not bother me at all. Plus I really don't care about 4 extra buttons to press for Netflix, Hulu etc. When I can just tell the remote to open the app for me3. It has games to play with your family for free too. Really fun games especially in the covid times when we're all together so much of the time.4. Picture and volume are beautiful on my TV. They fit the screen perfectly5. There are tons of actual FREE apps for movies, TV shows, live TV and more. And yes ALL FREE NEVER CHARGE.Plain and simple this is the best alternative to cable ever. I'm saving 150 dollars a month just using the fire stick. Yes I have a netflixs account and Disney plus I pay for. But I have everything else absolutely FREE. This will NOT DISAPPOINT anyone.Set up is super easy and fast, just plug and play.

  This thing is a stupid piece of junk.I bought it because amazon is trash, and I can no longer watch twitch on my roku. So I had to get this thing to watch my dumb speedruns.It's absolutely garbage. Freezes constantly, and isn't smart enough to restart or go to a screen saver (it has screen savers, it just doesn't use them?)I'm basically only using it for twitch, which is owned by Amazon, I would kind of understand if it was struggling with a different service, but it feels like if it worked with anything, it would be twitch.It also only autodetects/outputs at one(?) resolution, so if you'd like to hook it up to an older tv, it will give you a hard time there. Probably not an issue for most people, but we have a 1080i TV in the kitchen.Obviously if you want to use it for twitch, you're stuck with this stupid garbage machine, but if you're using it for Netflix/Hulu/other, I think the Roku is better in every possible way (and probably spying on you slightly less).

  This FS Lite is amazing! As fast as a 4K stick! The rom expansion is 10x easier, no annoying ADB Shell to deal with, just plug-n-play the hardware and within 1 minute it formats and is done. Alexa is functional. The 1080 streams are crisp and clear.  You will never find a better streamer for under $30. I run a Shield Pro and Tivo 4K, and will keep this FS Lite in the arsenal. I have nothing negative to say about it. Good job Amazon!

  I wanted to write a review to outline how/what we used this for.  We have a older Vizio flat screen TV in a workout room.  We wanted to bring up the Peloton app to access workouts on the TV rather than streaming them on an iPad.  This device gave us exactly what we needed.  While I can access Prime Video, Netflix, etc, we were able to pull up Peloton and it works like a charm.  If you are looking for a simple streaming device for a good price, this works great.

  Update: Buyer beware!!!Here’s the problem. There was no instructions in regards to the TV possibly turning black because of the fire stick anywhere that I read in the box it came in. I did not know this was an issue and after 45 minutes of trying to get my living room TV working I thought it was broken. I then purchased and replaced that TV and moved the fire stick to a bedroom where the same issue kept occurring, prompting me to do some research only to find on the internet it was the fire stick causing the issue. I find it quite unprofessional for Amazon, a billion dollar company, to not disclose such problems. I live on disability and buying a new TV took money from me buying food and necessities for the month.

  The initial setup process was kind of a hassle. My fire stick lite would not immediately display on my TV. I eventually got it up after many cable repositionings and power cycles of my tv. At this time the device was in Spanish and halfway through setup mode. Luckily I can read Spanish quite well so I progressed through the prompts and got to settings to change the language. Oddly though it only changed it for half my menu options, as you can see in my picture. I had to reset the device and then got all the prompts that I was missing from before. This time it was all in English.When setting up my apps, I found it annoying that I cannot delete certain apps or remove them as an option. This is going into a guest room so I really didn’t want to leave the photos app on there for people to browse. Instead I set up parental controls and luckily from there you can restrict access to the app. Functionality is otherwise easy. Kid friendly remote. Great price point at the $17 sale. Glad my stupid tv can now be smart.

Fire OS 7.2.2.8 latest as of 1-15-20210. Fire TV Home Version 6300182.1.Bought this since my Fire Cube TV 2 does not do Dolby Atmos for prime video at 1080p. I use a Sony 1080p projector with amazing picture quality, not willing to pay $5,000-$20,000 to upgrade to Sony 4K projector yet.

  This stick has a learning curve as far as the eye can see.  (Amazon did offer some help, after 5 minutes getting to the right person, but I'd already spent a couple hours setting the stick up and trying to figure things out on my own.)You can get some content ""for free"".  (In my experience, you should expect to sit thru multiple ads throughout the program.)  Or you can put out more money to get content, some of which may be worth your time to watch.I feel like I purchased an advertising tool.  I get ads for the services & I pay for the services, or I use ""free"" services and watch ads.  Stick gets you coming and going.

  I have many fire sticks.  As well as an original Fire TV, and 2nd gen Fire TV Cube.  All work great.  First gen sticks are really slow now though; don't use them really anymore (sometimes bring them while traveling to use with hotel TV's).I bought this new lite version because I have a portable projector that I use with fire sticks.  I usually used the old gen 1 fire stick, which again, was slow.  This new firestick is super fast (equal to the Firestick 4k) and works great with my projector.  While using the projector I have no TV or Volume to control with a remote; so, I didn't need those functions.  My projector also only puts out 720.  So again, no need for the 4k.  If you want a Firestick that will last the longest, and provide the best picture, get the 4k stick.  But, for some people, like for my uses, this lite version fits my needs perfectly.

  This is not my first fire stick. They wanted to send me a refurbished stick to replace my brand new one. Would not replace with a new one. Prices fluctuated since purchase. They said they would look into it and call me back at an agreed upon time. They did not. Very dissatisfied with this purchase. It is like they didn't want to help because I purchased it on sale. ....

  Oh my...I shouldn't have waited so long to purchase.I wasn't sure if I needed it but now I don't know what I would do without it.It was super easy to connect to my TV and setup.It plugged right in and then I was ready to watch my shows in under 10 minutes!

  if you use some of the older Apps such as Sling Player this version will not work, spent over an hour with Support they sent replacements. Still do not work, there must have been some change in the ""remote control"" code which the developers of this version neglected to tell the App guys and never bothered to test completely.Suffice to say this will probably be never fixed as the App developers are either dead or millionaires and couldn't care less, and Sling will not know where the code is anyway.  Amazon will deny the problem because no one there can understand what the users are sayingAfter this review, finally got to someone in support, that told me that despite this being the ""2020"" edition it is still a 1st Generation Fire Stick, not that he actually said that I had to parse that info from a 20 minute conversation.To cut a long story short there are Apps this version does not support, good luck finding a list, as the Rep have to call who knows who to find out himself, he said the info in on their site somewhere but despite his protestations I cannot find it anywhere.The limitations associated with this device should be emblazoned on the product page, as Amazon demands of all those who sell on their site.

  I have two t.v.s now and have a Firestick with Alexa that changes the volume and turns the t.v on and off.  I thought since this one was made in 2020 it would do the same.  I saw the little t.v. icon on the remote and thought that was the button to turn the t.v. off. My bad. It does exactly what it is supposed to do but I feel kinda dumb for thinking this 2020 version would be better than my old one from last year that handles both the volume and the t.v. turning on and off. I guess I have to use two remotes. No biggie.

  Just purchased for use with a projector for outdoor family movies. All are working well - both sound and picture. Only disappointment so far is there does not seem to be a supported Xfinity app - anyone know why? I hope this gets added soon so I can watch live TV as well.

  Firestick lite? I wouldn't say so. This version of the fire stick has all the features of a regular firestick without Dolby quality sound, volume controls, and a power button.Pro’s• It still has 1080p HD quality video, quad core processor and 802.11 AC wifi connection.• Quad core CPU 1.7Ghz• 1Gb DDR4 RAM• 8 gig internal storage. A small portion is of it is used for the OS. So it more like 5 gig for applications.• It’s running the same Fire OS 7.2.2.3 as the regular FIrestick.• Dual band WiFi AC.Alexa voice remote.Con’s (difference) what’s new?- No IR remote control. What this means is:- No power control for TV, or other devices.- No volume buttons for TV.This is what makes it Lite because you don’t get the standard 2nd generation remote.- No Dolby vision- No Dolby Atmos sound. Has Dolby digital+ stream service button.Kind of like a hot key for all your streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu.For the price point you won't even miss the volume buttons. And for a person just getting into streaming devices this is the least expensive option compared to all the other devices on the market period. If you've never had streaming device at all you won't miss anything at all.Now if you're not new to streaming devices and you've Hey experience with Amazon products you might just miss the volume control and power buttons, but it's not a big deal.I've had every Amazon device there is from the first gen firestick, the 4K stick to the fireTV cube. I know all the features, the in and outs, and tricks on how to use each and every one of these devices, so when they came out with the lite I had to try it. It doesn't disappoint. It is the same fire stick but just try to imagine, or remember the fire stick before 4K, and before the power options and volume remote the IR features. It actually has the same power, and performance as the 4K Firestick, just 1080p HD. This was just a way for Amazon to corner the market by having the cheapest streaming device on the market ahead of all the new competition bringing out streaming devices. And again, it does not disappoint. It’s also faster than the standard 2nd gen Firestick, so if you have a 2nd gen this is a very economical upgrade.• With the lite there's no cheaper device this good on the market, and no reason to buy any other device on the market if you are just getting started, and now Amazon has a device for all price points, this is the economy Amazon package.Great job Amazon!

  Spectrum's move to all-digital was my breaking point with my ever-increasing cable bill.  I have six televisions, only two of which were using boxes, and this change would mean that I would have to rent an additional four.  I have two Apple TV boxes and one Amazon Firestick, and can say that this is much speedier and more reliable than either of them.  I've been trying it out for about a week now, and am confident in dropping Spectrum at the end of this billing cycle.By the way - I see that some reviewers have complaints about customer service trying to charge them for setting up the Roku, or for adding or dropping channels, or for troubleshooting.  This is a scam perpetrated by someone with nothing at all to do with Roku.  An outside entity was able to create a fake Roku site that topped the list when googling ""Roku.""  The phone number you would call if you pulled it from this website was fake and, again, had nothing to do with Roku.  Roku was the main victim in this scheme, it's cost them negative feedback all over the internet.  Just DON'T google Roku and call any number you find at the site until this is straightened out.  Look for a number on the documentation sent with your device.  If anyone at the other end of the call tries to charge you for any of these things, you haven't reached the legitimate Roku support guys.

  There is no volume but we bought the universal remote that the fire stick lite attaches to the back of for my parents. It was a WIN WIN!! They are tech challenged to the Nth degree and it was the best combination we could find. It created one remote. The universal remote controls the tv volume, input for devices, their hdtv antenna, and then they flip it over for the fire stick lite. It was the best combination we could find! The universal is made by Phillips and the fire stick attaches to the back. You have to try it if you need volume control and access to multiple devices.

  I got this as Black Friday deal and am disappointed. Roku is still the industry standard and they will remain so as long as competitors like this put out subpar products.Likes:Easy setupAmazon integrated (obviously)AffordableDislikes:Long FW update out of the box on a device that was only released two months ago.UI - not intuitive and hard to tell what your cursor is highlighting.Slow response from remote compared to all other remotes ever used.Unstable apps. I've had to reset the device when a stream I was watching froze. It did this three times in the 6 hours I had been using the device.If you don't need this for a specific reason ( like twitch) then go with a Roku.

  Since most of my OTA viewing is on the sub channels that mostly broadcast in 4:3 aspect ratio. I am very disappointed that the Fire TV line does not allow for the native aspect ratio to come through. This is not an insignificant issue to a lover of the old TV shows. It causes the video to stretch to fit the screen and distort the image. This is the only product line like this I have ever heard of that does not let you get the native aspect ratio. I have many shows that I am going to have to continue to record and watch on the tuners of my PC instead of the new FireTV  Recast and Fire sticks I just purchased. The main purpose of the purchases was to save the PC from over work to just record TV. I never even thought to check on this issue before purchase since only an uneducated designer would even think to hamper a system in this matter. It makes me rethink all of the other Amazon Echo products I have on hand. Some of them still in the return window. I am going to give it two weeks in the hopes that somewhere I can find a solution, if not I will have to return it all.Update-12-18-2020: Lowered to one star. Latest software update changes the controls for Live TV which was a big mistake. Will say more on review if Fire TV recast.As for the FireStick the menu is now less responsive. Most things take longer to do. Once again Amazon shows the lack of understanding real people.

  I have had a roku for 5 years almost and it was sooooooo slooooooow. as soon as I got the FIre stick it was a breath of fresh air. I love how fast this thing is. I Love watching anime but when My roku crapped out on me I had to use my smart tv but for some reason funimation would not work it would be so dang choppy. I'm so happy to be watching funimation again.CRITICAL UPDATE: so I'm not sure if anyone else is having this issue but it seems like if you use this product for too long a period of time it starts to freeze and lock up and then I have to restart it in the settings. I have a 300+ mbs download speed it shouldn't be doing this. I have to re-evaluate the stars i have it. I can't do 5 I can only do 3 not the best product amazon has made at all.

  I purchased this fire stick through Target as the one on amazon was sold out and I'm really hoping what I got was a lemon.The firestick constantly has to be unplugged and restarted for it to work and the remote has really poor connectivity - to the point where it's unusable.  Nothing is quite as frustrating as standing two inches away from a device and the remote still triggers no action.Super bummed about this product.

  I bought this Firestick ""LITE"" thinking it would be easy for my 84 year old Mom to use. I personally have 2 old Roku boxes. I'm going to have to give her one of the Rokus and take the Firestick myself and see if I can get past the HEADACHE of not having all this unasked-for sh_t on it. It streams when I haven't chosen an APP, much less a show. It just won't shut up! I want to be silent and not MOVE while I choose my shows. But nooooo, it's constantly running previews or something, in the background while I try to obtain apps that should have come already on it! Why was PBS not on it already? Why is Netflix not already on it? Had to download both of those. The interface is just too busy, way too busy. Can't FIND the forest for the trees. God I wish I had just bought another ROKU. Going to see if I can return this.

  Read this review if you care about if your ISP limits data use.A little background I am a long time cord cutter, used different devices over the years. Decided to switch due to new service only works on Roku. We use Comcast and have 1TB monthly data limit before fees hit. I also monitor using my routers traffic analyzer to see what is sucking up all my data. After using the Roku Streaming Stick+ for a few days noticed a spike in data use at AM hours and isolated the usage to my new Roku. This version of Roku has a power button to control your TV's power (very handy) Also the Roku can be powered via TV USB or external power supply if your TV's USB ports are too weak. My Roku is plugged into a power supply.**Heres the rub** So by force of habit when I finish watching TV I have been hitting the power button, TV goes off as expected, but the Roku continues to stream the streaming service I was accessing. (disclaimer only tested Prime and PSVUE so far) My router confirmed the damn thing streamed all night long (all night....all night long, dancin in the streets) with the TV off. Also confirmed by just turning the TV off and back on, what ever is being watched is still rolling.**the solution** To date I can't find a setting to time-out based on the Roku nor a method to automatically switch to standby when the TV shuts off without replacing a power strip. So my solution to date is  MAKE SURE TO HIT THE HOME BUTTON BEFORE POWERING DOWN THE TV.Other than wasting my internet data it seems like a solid device will post an update if another solution presents itself.

  The Roku Streaming Stick + worked OK, but soon after installing it, other WiFi devices began to get kicked off the network.  I noticed in the android WiFI analyzer app that someone had brought up a WiFi access point on the same channel as mine. :(  It was also transmitting at a higher power than mine.  I soon realized that it was the Roku stick's WiFi Direct connection to its remote.  I tried changing my WAP to a different channel, but the Roku followed it there.  I tried changing from 2.4 to 5Ghz, but it also followed my access point to the new frequency/channel.  I reached out to Roku tech support, and they suggested that I change channels on my WAP...which I'd already done.  I informed them that I'd already been down that rabbit hole and they said to try a free HDMI extender?  The stick was on a 3 foot extender already.  Roku used to have an option in the firmware to try to correct this issue, but they've removed it.  I would have given 2 or 3 stars if they'd been more helpful.  But as it is, I must highly discourage anyone from purchasing this product until they fix the WiFi design/firmware.  I hope they do fix it.  If not, I'd probably go for an older Roku model with an infrared remote.

  Immediately right out of the box I had nothing but problems with the Roku remote: the ""UP"" arrow on the scrolling cross only worked about half the time (it would make the ""ding"" sound when pushed but wouldn't move anything on the screen) which for a streaming device is completely unacceptable. Think about how much time a person spends scrolling through menus! So thinking this was simply a defective remote, I bought another brand new Roku Streaming Stick+ and took the remote out of the box and synced it with my system and guess what? This time the ""Left"" button on the scrolling cross only worked about half the time (again it would make a sound but wouldn't actually do anything on the screen) AND the power button did a ""double tap"" about 75% of the time: If the TV was on and I pushed the power button I would hear two ""clicks"" and the TV would turn off and then turn back on again! Same thing if the TV was off and I hit the power button- I would hear two clicks and the TV would turn on and then turn back off. Again- completely unacceptable.And the worst part about this is that Roku has known that their remotes are cheap and inferior quality and have done NOTHING to fix them! In reading older reviews on Amazon (something I should have done before purchasing) tons of other customers have complained about the low quality of Roku remotes for the last 18 months, and while Roku has commented on a few of these reviews offering only lame platitudes, they have done NOTHING to actually fix the problem.ATTENTION ROKU: It is clear that you're losing thousands of customers due to the shoddy quality of your remote controls...maybe that's something you should address??In the meantime I returned both my Roku Streaming Stick+ and bought the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K and found it is FAR SUPERIOR!!!!! The remote is snappy and works flawlessly, and the interface is also FAR SUPERIOR, so thank you Roku for steering me away from your brand so I could discover that the Fire TV Stick 4K is a much better option.If you're considering purchasing a Roku product, do yourself a favor and read the incredible amount of negative reviews on here BEFORE you make a purchase decision and save yourself the hassle of having to go through what I did with their bottom-tier level, inferior quality junk. (Also note that Roku's ""Customer Service"" is non-responsive and non-helpful).

  Extremely disappointed with this product. I have owned it for 4 months. About a month ago it began malfunctioning. Periodically the unit will turn on, work for about 30 seconds, then simply go dead. Usually when this happens it will occur at least two times in a row. I called support and their solution was to plug it into a different HDMI port. This did not solve the problem. So I have to make another call to hopefully get a 4 month old unit replaced because it is defective. Also, the remote drains the batteries every 3 weeks. I should have purchased a fire tv stick. Don’t waste your money.

  Streaming stick was great at start - hooked up easily and worked well; good picture and sound.  Good remote that also handled TV power and sound volume.However, one day it just failed - wouldn't connect to WiFi.  A WiFi network with other devices and with the main hub just two feet from the Roku.  Signal quality was very high and speed tests on WiFi were strong (100Mb)Text to Amazon ""Get Product Support"" got a quick, polite chat started.  All the usual ideas: reboot, repower, reconnect, reset, redo password.  After 10 minutes, the advice was to contact Roku.Roku site was a set of videos on setup.  And, their policies on warranty/replacement only apply for 30 days.So I had a great 3 month product but now it is useless (not even large enough to function as a paperweight!)

  I have had a bad history with 4K Roku devices. With my new 4K system I tried to use first the Premiere+, then the Ultra, and finally the Streaming Stick+, all played through the A/V receiver in my living room's 7.2 system. All three devices failed with HDCP 2.2 errors. Despite the fact that all components in my new system were 2.2 compatible, the Rokus would stop the entire system because its software apparently imagined that I had a recording device attached to my receiver. A Stick+ plugged directly into the 4K TV in my bedroom worked fine.I last sent Roku an email about the problem in April 2018. I had long since returned all the devices to Amazon for credit. Then in February 2019, ten months later, I received an email from Roku stating that the software problem had been corrected and that I should be able to use 4K devices. I decided to give it one last chance and bought a Stick+ for the living room. I've had it for about a week and it seems to be working fine.I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because (a) it took Roku TEN MONTHS to fix this problem and I don't imagine that I'm the only person who experienced it and (b) they put these devices on the market before they were functioning properly.Not everyone plugs their devices directly into their TV, and Roku should have an effective way to correct problems in a timely fashion. None of the other 2.2 compatible devices I have has ever had any 2.2 problems.

  The Roku Streaming Stick+ is simply awesome.  It's super easy to set up, it's powered by your TV, and the signal booster that is built in to the USB cable ensures a strong wireless connection.  This thing attaches entirely to the backside of your TV and is completely out of sight once it's installed.  I bought this for use with a bedroom TV because I didn't want any unnecessary electronics cluttering up the room, and I couldn't be happier.

  I bought this Roku Streaming Stick+ in October 2018 to replace my old FireStick which was really slow and old and frustrating to use because it would suddenly stop in the middle of a show and go back to the home page.The Roku was easy to set up, and worked great for a couple of months. In December we had the first problem: it wouldn't work: just showed a bad picture with zigzagging lines. We reset it and couldn't get the picture to show up at the right size: it was enormous. Called tech support, and the guy helped us fix that problem. Then another problem presented: no audio and Roku remote won't control TV. I don't remember what I did to fix it, but it started working again. Good deal.We were gone for a week during the holidays. Came back and the Roku worked fine up until 2 weeks ago. Same problem as before. My husband was home, and he did what the technician had us do the first time: reset the unit and start over with setup. All good, but now the audio is not coming through again and we can't control the TV with the Roku remote. I couldn't remember what I did to fix it, so I called tech support. The guy had us try several things to get the remote to work and the sound to come through, but nothing worked. He said he could replace the unit, but we would have to return the one we have before they would send out the new one, and that I would get an email explaining how to ship it back and where to ship it. A day or two later, I got an email telling me that my case was ""under review."" Then I got another couple of emails asking me how they had done! I told them that I was not happy and explained about never getting an email with return merchandise information. That was 2 days ago.They sent another auto-reply. Today, I looked and they had send another ""how did we do"" email. I clicked on the link to let them know that my issue is still unresolved, and their web page says that they closed my ticket!!!

  Don't normally write reviews unless they are extraordinarily good or extraordinarily bad.  For what it worth, here is a Two-in-One review to illustrate the opposite ends of the spectrum.The Extraordinarily Bad:  Roku Customer Service & Technical SupportIn an effort to cut the cord and start streaming, did my research to determine the best content (Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, DirecTV, Youtube TV, etc.) and hardware (Amazon Fire sticks, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Roku's, etc.) required for the entire family to enjoy.  From the hardware perspective, settled on Roku sticks because Youtube TV did not (at the time) support Fire sticks for obvious reasons.  Started as a trial with a Roku stick against the some streaming providers listed above, and it worked quite well.  So ended up buying a total of 5 Roku streaming sticks (3 to keep and 2 to share) on various occasions in 2018 on Amazon.  One of them stopped working after a few months but still was under 1 year warranty.  Spent a few days troubleshooting by mixing and matching the configurations of the 3 sticks against 4 different TV sets under 2 different WIFI networks.  The results consistently showed that the stick in question (the stick itself and not the remote nor the TVs nor the WIFI networks) worked intermittently for a few minutes then the TV screens went blank.Contacted Roku as follow:1. Logged a ticket on Roku website indicating the problem as such.  No response for several days until after calling them in next step.2. Called technical support explaining the problem and the troubleshooting process above.  They said they'll send an HDMI extender.3. Received the extender 2 weeks later, but it did not work at all - no audio, no video, just blank screen.  The problem was actually worst since using the stick without the extender would at least work for a few minutes then stopped.4. Called them the following day. They admitted that they had sent a bad part and will make sure to send a ""working"" HDMI extender.  It never arrived.  Probably never send it.5. After 2 weeks of waiting, called them again and explained the troubleshooting process all over again (for the 4th time).  They said they will send a remote.  With patience running thin, asked the tech support rep why would she send a remote when the stick is the problem.  After a brief silence, she asked to wait for a few minutes then came back and said an email with instructions on how to return the stick for a replacement will be sent.6. Three days later, still no email.  And no, it's not in spam folder.  Simply put - they lied the second time.  Frustrated but decided to give them a final chance to rectify the problem and called one last time.  After 25 minutes, a rep finally answered then the line got cut off immediately.  Coincidence?Bottom line:  The problem had been reported for over a month and still no resolutions.  The average wait time for each call is 30+ minutes due to the so called ""heavy call volume"".  They sent bad part and lied their way out of honoring their warranty.The Extraordinarily Good:  Amazon Customer ServiceFrustrated and planned to just throw away the stick, but also decided to give Amazon a call to inform the type of service Roku had provided with the hope that if this is the norm, Amazon will think twice before selling Roku products on its site.  The Amazon CS rep apologized, offered a refund, and will work with Roku on the issue.  Didn't expect that!  After all, this is a Roku's problem not Amazon's.  The call took less than 5 minutes.  Problem solved.  Thank you Amazon.  This is another reason for being a Prime member.In the streaming war against giants like Amazon, Google, Apple, Disney, etc. and with the type of service Roku had provided, good luck Roku.  For your survival in this crowded space, you (Roku) should take a page out of Amazon's playbook and learn from it.  Otherwise, you will be crushed like a cockroach that you are.Update:Finally received the Warranty Swap email from Roku four days after the call in step 5 above (a few hours after posting this review). Decided to ignore it as so much time had already been wasted. It's unfortunate that the device worked quite well (when and if it worked), but the customer service is unbearable.

  BUYER BEWARE - I've purchased Roku players in  August 2012, May 2015, and this new Stream Stick+ in 2018.  When I had a problem ""activating"" my new Streaming Stick+, I was given a number to ""Contact Support Toll Free to Activate Instantly"". I called the number and was told that since I had already registered 2 other Roku devices, in order to Activate this 3rd device, I would need to pay $70.00 to have a PREMIUM account. I told them that I didn't need nor want a PREMIUM account. I asked the customer service rep, to deactivate the first Roku I purchased in 2012 and then I would only have 2 registered devices on my account. I was told that - (1) Even if I deactivated a previous Roku player or (2  )if I opened a new account, I would still have to pay the $70.00 in order to register my Streaming Stick+ .So that is how Roku rewards it's returning long-time customer, by charging them a fee of $70.00 to activate more than 2 of their Roku devices!  So, in addition to paying for the device itself, you now have to pay an extra $70.00 to use it!!!I am hoping this review will alert other potential buyers to Roku's new policy of rewarding their repeat customers.Patti

  We bought this Roku Streaming Stick+ thinking that all we had to do was plug it in and follow instructions. WELL NO! We have a Samsung Smart tv with numerous HDMI slots. We tried ALL of them and the update on the Stick would not load! We kept getting a 005 Network Error. I chatted online with ""Ray"". He stated that I would have to pay Technical support $69 to update the Stick+ . He explained that there have been too many errors updating their products so the company decided that the customer cannot update their new devices on their own and will now have to pay someone to do it for you! NOWHERE in the reviews I read did anyone state that I would be paying an additional $69 to use this device! So here I have a brand new device which costs $65 and now Roku wants to hold that item hostage and render it useless unless I fork over $69 for an update AND oh yes...that $69 would give me 6 months of free tech support! Yay!? Not gonna happen. I will NEVER purchase an item from this company again. They are way out of their league charging for technical support for an update to a brand new device.

  I'm a long-time Roku user, having purchased devices from every generation throughout Roku's evolution. I've had the very original Roku N1100, Roku 2 XD, Roku 2 XS, Roku 3 (2013 version), Roku 4, a TCL Roku TV, Roku Ultra (2016 version)...and now this Stick +. While I've only had it for a couple of days now, this might be the best Roku I've seen from a value perspective.My house is a Roku house. We have 5 televisions but don't have a cable or satellite subscription.. One of the TV's is a Roku TV and the other 4 all have a Roku attached to them. Literally everything we watch is delivered via the Roku. Our OTA material is delivered from a Tablo DVR to our Rokus. Our local media is served up via a Plex server to the Rokus. We also have PS Vue, Netflix, Amazon video, etc. etc. Bottom line, we use Roku a lot, and I'm very familiar with them. I wouldn't consider myself to be a Roku ""fan boy"", though. While most of the Roku's I've had have been great...there have been some clunkers. The Roku 2XS was a turd that never got any better. The Roku 4 was a turd at the start, but gradually got better with each subsequent firmware update. Unfortunately, the cooling fan in one of my Roku 4s (The 4 was the only Roku model to ever have one) has begun to make the dreaded ""grinding"" noise in recent weeks, so I decided to try replace it with a stick+.I've generally been leery about all of the ""stick"" form-factor devices. They've generally lagged behind the more traditional ""box"" form-factor devices as far as specs go. The Stick+, with its quad-core processor, HEVC support, and 4K capabilities convinced me that the gap may have finally been closed.So, after a couple of days with the Stick+...here are my thoughts on this device- It's snappy and smooth. It's maybe not quite as quick as my Roku Ultras...but it's every bit as fast as the Roku 4.- The new remote is great.The ability to control the TV's power and volume without a second remote or a universal remote is loooong overdue.- Excellent wireless reception. I had two walls between the Stick+ and my router, but was easily streaming 16mbps local media through Plex.- Powering via the TV's USB isn't optimal. Assuming your TV stops providing power to the USB when turned-off, the Stick+ will have to go through the boot-up sequence and then connect to your wireless before you can do anything with it each time you turn on your TV. This can take ~30 seconds. I highly recommend plugging it directly into an outlet using the provided adapter.So, this is a great Roku device. It doesn't have the same bells-and-whistles that my Roku Ultra's have...but then again, I also paid nearly twice as much for those. This Stick+ is much cheaper, provides basically the same UI/playback performance, and also has a remote that will make having to juggle your Roku and TV remotes a thing of the past. That's why I say, absent some deal-breaker that I haven't encountered yet, this is the best dollar-for-dollar Roku yet.

  I purchased the Streaming Stick+ after having repeated difficulties and problems with the Amazon Fire TV Stick.  The difference in quality between these two products is astounding. While the Fire TV Stick required constant reboots and had consistently poor network performance, the Roku has been flawless and completely without problems.  The addition of 4K support is a huge bonus.  I'm especially impressed with the connectivity.  My room, where I'm using the device, is on a different floor, on the other side of the house from our router, but I've never had an issue with connectivity or performance.The menu/interface is a little outdated, but I'd gladly sacrifice a flashy menu for good performance.  It's astounding to me what a bad product the Fire TV Stick was now that I've switched to Roku. I enjoy the wide selection of channels as well - every streaming service seems to be available through Roku.  The voice functionality on the remote works well, and I like that I can turn my TV on and off with the Roku remote as well as adjust the volume.  All in all it's an awesome product.

  EARLIER REVIEW: Works just fine* and because our TV is not mounted, the length of the stick is not a problem at all. My husband enjoys the voice command feature and used it occasionally. At some point he was watching the TV and I don't know what he clicked on but the TV started talking--NONSTOP--reading everything on the screen. I was perplexed but, if this happens to you, go into ""Accessibility"" to turn it off. Apparently it's a feature for the sight-impaired.*LATER REVIEW (EDIT): THIS REMOTE IS A POS, It worked for about five months and then stopped working at all. If I hadn't read some other reviews where people had the same problem and discovered they had to change batteries way too frequently--one person had to remove the batteries every night and then put them back in the next night--I wouldn't have known that changing the batteries might work. We put in new batteries and it worked fine . . .  for a few days. Then it stopped again.THE COMPANY'S RETURN POLICY IS A JOKE.I wanted to return it but the company has made it sufficiently difficult and iffy to make most people give up on that idea, given the hoops you have to jump through, the resulting length of time it would take to have your TV viewing restored, and the fact that one of the major faults in this remote seems to be that it eats thought batteries. Also, if the remote's problem was its propensity to eat up the charge in your batteries, the company would likely try new batteries and then send it back saying, ""You needed to change the batteries."" So basically we have to eat the price of this thing and take a chance on some other model. Or maybe we'll just get some other system than Roku.RETURN AND WARRANTY SERVICE PROCESS [Sorry about spacing; it was in pdf format]Please  access  and  review  Roku  Support  online  help  resources  at  support.roku.com  before  seeking  warranty  service.

  Folks something is wrong with the remote controls for the Roku sticks.  The remotes works and then all of the sudden they won't control the TV or talk to the stick anymore.  I bought another one and returned the first thinking I just got a bad unit.  Nope replacement unit had quit talking to the stick about 5 minutes after setting up all my passwords.  Stick with the big units until Roku figures this out.

  Original title was: Perfect streaming stick with poor supporting (but mandatory) accessories… however, see updates belowI have bought three units. Two were installed successfully and are working great (with small adjustments described below)!The third one needed to be sent back to Amazon for replacement due to the poor quality and design of its unique power / antenna cable (you can’t find this cable anywhere and it cannot be bought separately). It easily snapped when installed on one of my wall-mounted televisions.In addition, I have a 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD television (Sony XBR-65X900A, a model from 2013) and my single 4K UHD HDCP 2.2 port is placed on the television’s back in an area that cannot fit this stick (due to its size and shape). I needed to add a small flexible extending cord to connect it. Finally, I also got an error message (from Roku) on that same television saying it is not getting enough power from the television’s USB port ... so I had to use the power adaptor that comes with this product. However, the power extender is also a very short cable ...Bottom line, once you get it installed and running (after one week of viewing) the product is great. The sound and picture quality are amazing. I loved the Roku user interface and speedy response. Its only Achilles’ heel is related to its poor proprietary power / antenna cable.UPDATE (November 10, 2017): Amazon quickly replaced the damaged cable and I was contacted by Roku. Roku team provided me with all the help I have needed (well, it should be on its way to me, so I will keep you updated once I'll get it). Thanks a lot Amazon and Roku!UPDATE (November 19, 2017): Today I have opened the door to my beloved FedEx delivery guy and look what I have got from Roku! The three (3) HDMI extenders (as promised) and an additional (and totally new) Roku Streaming Stick+ - all for FREE. Just as a reward for writing this review and adding my comments to it. To remind you, my original review had only four (4) stars (due to the issue with the product's accessory, as described above) – however, now I have updated it to five (5) stars. Because in my book - caring for customers and addressing their needs (and beyond) and making customers feel cared and important – it what makes a company (and its products) prefect. We all know, there are no real perfect products out there. For every product out there, we can always apply our hopes and wishful thinking (""I wish they have added that feature to it"", “I wish the screen was bigger”, ""I wish they have used that my preferred CPU "" and so forth). But a company with a great product and a perfect customer care, how many can you find out there?So, once again - Thank You Roku so much! I really like your product and now admires your service!

  ***Quick note before reading numerous reviews! I research everything immensely before I buy it and one HUGE discrepancy I noticed when reading the top reviews for Roku devices is that they mostly date back to 2017-2018 and sometimes even before. Please take into account that THIS Roku is the 2019 release date and THAT is the device you will receive and the device that I purchased & reviewed :). I'm sure what other's wrote is valid for their particular Roku based on the release date but rest assured that a review from 2017 or 2018 can NOT cover a product released in 2019! Hope this proves helpful for anyone considering any streaming device (don't judge the newest model on old model reviews)!A little back story, I do own both Rokus (5 now 😂- mostly different generations but my two most recent ones are this one and the Ultra) and Amazon Fire Sticks (2 - various generations) and although I enjoy them all for the fact that we were able to cut our cable about 6 years ago thanks to them, I would say I am thoroughly enjoying this one and the Ultra the most. The technology is the most recent release dates and they stream absolutely flawlessly!I chose to purchase this particular Roku for my father because his bedroom is located on the top floor of our home while our modem is connected in our basement which is a concrete box of internet deadzone (the modem must be connected down there or the internet won't reach the entire house unfortunately, but we are in the process of getting booster Pods from Xfinity). We have the now 300 mb Xfinity internet (aka nerdy gaming speeds - was previously 250 mb) with our router/modem located in our basement for optimum connectivity and a WiFi range extender but our house still has connectivity issues with most devices. This Roku is not only 4K but it's supposed to be exceptionally good for connectivity which played a huge role in choosing this particular one.As soon as I plugged this Roku in, it was love at first home screen just as I had experienced with the Ultra that I had purchased several weeks prior. It recognized all my accounts, downloaded everything quickly, was extremely user friendly and the streaming quality is AMAZING. My father had become all too familiar with the loading screens on various streaming devices and we are ecstatic to be able to say goodbye to them for good thanks to the long-range wireless receiver in this bad boy. The picture quality is always exceptional whether streaming HD, HDR or 4K. This particular Roku stick is also so user friendly that my 70 year father (who generally avoids computers and technology like the plague) can even use it! I also believe this to be the best Roku for it's price point. The Ultra is amazing, but is not necessary in my opinion for most users although it too is highly impressive. We are very pleased with this Roku device and would definitely recommend it.***I took side by side photos of his new Roku (this one - the Roku Streaming Stick+) and his older model, the Roku 3. You can see based off the photos the difference in the remotes, particularly that the newer remote is much skinnier and more comfortable in your hand. The volume controls are the same with the exception of the mute button on the new remote. The Roku 3 remote is also shiny and has different channel buttons compared to the Roku Stick+ remote that is a matte black and features newer streaming channels. The new remote also has the on/off button that most Roku's feature and allows you to easily connect to your tv (it literally auto connects for you) and gives you the power to use your Roku remote on your TV as well. Last note, the picture quality is beautiful even on my Dad's older LG flat screen, but my phone only takes sub par pictures of it so don't mind that 😂.

  This device, which should in theory need to know absolutely nothing about you, DEMANDS that you:- fill out multiple annoying Captcha screens during activation- full legal name (cannot opt out)- date of birth (cannot opt out)- gender (cannot opt out, male or female only, no allowance for the people who have ambiguous genders)- credit card information (cannot opt out), even if you never want to use it through their account- which room of the house it will be used in (cannot opt out)- which room of the house all your old Roku devices that you long ago threw out are located in (cannot opt out)I will never purchase anything through this Roku account.  It's invasive and I hate it.  For any content that I pay for, I will pay directly, like Amazon or Hulu or HBO.

  The Roku devices are simple and easy to use. I have Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire Stick. I love my Roku Streaming Sticks. These are truly simple to use that my 6yr old kid and 65yr old parents can use them. There are so many steaming app options to use it is great. My one issue is that it never shuts off. Now this might not seem that big of a deal, but if you have a limitation on internet usage, this will eat it right up. I recommend also getting an APC P8GT 8 Outlets Power Strip. This unit has a Parent/Child feature, so once you turn your TV off, the Roku, DVD Player, and another item will also power off until the TV turns back on.

  I’m so annoyed with my Roku! I just received it a week ago and it has major issues. Every time I turn the TV on, it takes at least a few minutes for the Roku remote to work. I’m able to turn the volume up/down, but none of the other buttons work.I’ve also had an issue where the screen goes fuzzy (picture attached) and freezes when opening an app. I had to reset the stick.I’m using this with a new 4K LG smart tv so it can’t be an issue with compatibility. I’ve had amazon fire sticks in the past and they never had these issues!

  Bought this Roku as I’m an Xfinity Stream customer. This seems to be the only solution for us that don’t want to watch/stream only on our phones or iPads but also on our TVs. I’m a die hard Amazon Fire TV/Stick customer, but Xfinity only allows their Beta app to be downloaded on Roku.Set up was easy. And I found the Xfinity app in the Roku store easily. From start to finish it took about 6 mins, from booting, to updating, to creating a Roku account, to loading my app and logging in.I like that it comes with the extension cable in case you don’t have a USB port on the back of the TV to power the device. I did splurge with this upgraded version, for 4K, but figured this was a long term investment.Very happy with my purchase!

  I like the Roku stick but watch out for the SCAM when trying to activate.  Be sure to use your computer and NOT YOUR PHONE.  I first tried to activate on my phone and it would not work.  It said to not try the code a second time or it could ruin your device. Then there was a phone number to call.  Someone with the thickest accent answered and, OF COURSE, wanted more money to set it all up for a ONE TIME FEE.  I didn't really understand what he was saying, but I remember another review saying that they wanted to charge $70 to get set up.  I didn't even let the guy get that far.  I said I wasn't interested in paying for activation that was supposed to be FREE, and said I would be returning the Roku stick and hung up.  I then proceeded to try and activate again using my computer and I had NO PROBLEM AT ALL DOING IT BY MYSELF.  You do not have to put in any credit card information if you do it this way.  I would give the Roku stick 5 stars if there was not this scam out there.  Thank God, for the person that posted the review about the EXTRA FEE before I bought mine.  I just took the chance to order the stick because my sister has a couple and really loved it. SO, it really does work like it should, but DON'T FALL FOR THE SCAM!!!!! YOU CAN ACTIVATE YOUR DEVICE FOR FREE!!!!

  I previously had an older Firestick and was having some issues with it so I thought I'd try the Roku.  I paid $50 for the Roku stick, thinking that was all I'd have to pay.  Boy was I wrong.When I received the Roku and went to set it up, I got to an activation screen that said ""Roku does not charge for activation or support"".  However, it then prompted me to go to a website and input a code, which then gave me an error message and directed me to call a phone number.Upon calling this phone number, I was told that I would have to pay a fee of either $90 or $140 to unlock my Roku device.  I told the man on the phone that it says right on my screen that ""Roku does not charge for activation or support"".  He said that's right, and my device is already activate.  However, I can't use it unless I pay this fee.We went round and round, but ultimately I paid the $90 and my device was instantly unlocked.  Had I known in advance of this extra charge, I never would have bought the Roku and would have bought another Firestick instead.With the Firestick, you just pay the one time charge and then you can use it.  There's no extra ""activation"" or ""unlock"" fee (or whatever word Roku wants to call it).  Buyer beware!!

  I bought a few of these, cause we had tried all the media streamers and this one seemed to work the best of all of them.  Unfortunately if you use android (like millions of others do) Roku is only focused on iOS users.  The app is the only way to type on the screen that isnt the god-awful cursor based ""hunt and peck"".Well, search doesn't work on android and when I chatted with support, they just told me to use ios or to wait for possible further updates to see if that fixes my experience..THEN THEY JUST DISCONNECTED.  I tried contacting them back and they would read my previous transcript and immediately disconnect from me.  I wasn't rude or abrasive or anything.  they're simply finished trying to help I guess...  I tried talking to a supervisor ""Escel"" and he too would disconnect form me after saying hes reviewing my previous chat.I went to roku.com to get their phone number for support, but it was country code +44 (UK), and international calls cost big $, so Im stuck with chat.So I'm simply returning their half-baked sticks.  Amazon, Apple and Google will crush or acquire them soon anyway.  Bummer.

  I bought this to replace a cable box which wasn't being used, so I could return the box. I have Charter Spectrum which is supported by Roku. I received my Roku + yesterday and hooked it up to my living room TV to test it out.Setting It up was easy. I have it plugged into my HDMI on the TV and you have a choice of powering it through a USB port on your TV, or using the included wall plug which you plug the USB end into then plug it into an outlet, which I did.Roku takes you step by step setting it up and you do have to put in a credit card, I used PayPal. That's only if you want to watch something that's not free.I loaded the spectrum app, logged into spectrum with my username and password and have all my channels. Live and on demand. I also love the fact that when I use the Spectrum guide with the app, it only shows the channels I'm signed up for, unlike the guide on my DVR box which makes you scroll through all the channels.The remote control has a voice button that you hold down and say what you are looking for, and it takes you to the Roku app with all the results. To test it out I searched Clint Eastwood and so many movies showed up, but most of them needed to be paid for.I was also very impressed with all the movies and shows that Roku offers. Not all are free, but I set up a pin to prevent any unauthorized charges.I can't comment on the range of the wifi yet, but will update once I do.When I read the directions, there was something about using it with a 4k and there's a free adapter they will send, incase something doesn't fit. I went right onto Roku site and ordered it just to have in case I ever need it.I love this so much, I'm seriously considering getting rid of my DVR service and box on my living room TV to save more money.

  This is my second Roku in the house.  I bought this Streaming Stick + because of the flawless performance of my wired Roku device.My problem with the Streaming Stick + is the Remote and it's inability to pair.  After reading all the support pages and doing shutdowns, resets and fresh batteries it started to pair but then would stop responding.  The remote has some kind of a power problem and does not recognize the battery strength.  Half way through configuring the Roku the battery icon appears and shows ""no power"".  At that point the process stops.To prove it's the remote and not the device I paired my older remote with the Streaming Stick and it paired and configured properly and connected to my streaming accounts.Roku support first instructed me to contact Amazon for a new remote.  My response was ""Really?  Amazon doesn't carry components within a product they sell.  I would have to return the product.""  After 20 minutes of Chat with Roku support they finally agreed to ship me a new remote.

  Our old Roku player quit working after about 3 years. It kept giving me a purple screen with error codes. I contacted support and they said that I would need to replace it. I didn't feel that a product working 3 years would need to be replaced, but apparently Roku products do. I figured I would replace it, because I like the Roku Interface and when it worked I didn't really have any issues. We got a new TV, so I figured I would buy the streaming stick+ now that we could enjoy 4k. After a few months the product said it couldn't connect to the internet. When I look at the status of the internet connection it says good. I moved the Roku Streaming Stick+  to the TV next to the WiFi router and still have issues connecting to the internet. When I run the check internet status it says it can't connect. So I had Roku forget the Wifi, and reconnected to the internet. It connected back to the internet and said the connection was good, but then it says I have a weak internet connection again. I contacted support again, and they sent me a HDMI extender, which makes zero sense, because I don't understand how or why a HDMI extender would help with my WiFi connection. I'm reaching out to Roku again, but I'm guessing they will suggest I purchase a new roku product. I will never recommend Roku to anyone, and will never purchase any products from them again.If they won't stand by their products why should I?

  Nowhere does it say ""If you buy this and you use it, we get to use 1/3th of the screen to advertise whatever we want.""But that's what they do. As soon as you have configured the device 1/3 of the screen is showing you advertisements, trying to get you to buy whatever they are selling.You buy this for real money and then... They use you to get more money! That's now how it's supposed to work, now is it? No. I never agreed to that. Is that what it says on those really small letters that I can't read?""By using this you agree that you are the product and we just act as if you're the customer.""

  Got a new one yesterday and plugged it into my TV. Completed the initial setup steps like Language selection , Remote pairing and Wifi selection. The stick said it needed a software update and will reboot. Post the reboot, the stick would flash the initial startup logo and then just shutdown..Extremely disappointed with the purchase . Wish Roku had better QC in place.FINAL UPDATE 5/15/2019: Roku Support want me to ship this rubbish remote to them at my own cost and they will send a replacement. What these  ‘experts’ don’t seem to realize that the problem is inherent to the product and no amount of replacements is going to solve it. Maybe they should just look at Amazon reviews to see how many customers have had the same problem.UPDATE 12/12: I returned the stick for a replacement and had my fingers crossed hoping that this would just work but looks like Roku had other plans. The stick works (phew!) but the remote doesn't want to pair unless your 2 feet from the TV , which Roku should know, defeats the purpose of a remote control.UPDATE 12/18: Got in touch with Amazon who were wonderful in contacting Roku and ensuring that I got a replacement remote.Sadly the replacement remote worked fine the first day and had the same problem day two onwards.UPDATE 4/6 -  Multiple follow ups with Roku tech support has gone no where. Roku support keeps insisting I try and change the Wifi channel (non tech savy folks , if you are reading this, you should avoid this stick) and select one that is not congested. I tried doing that but the funny part is the Roku won't connect to those free channels (thanks for nothing Roku support!).I believe the product has inherent flaws which should have been fixed before the product was rolled out.The remote definitely has pairing issues , something which was not there in the older stick. Roku should acknowledge and fix this problem instead of sending replacement remotes.I really have lost all confidence in Roku now and will NOT buy anything from them ever again.

  What an incredible little piece of equipment! Because the wifi pickup is in the wire that connects to the power, it balances on top of my TV, and because of that, I get my wifi through 3 walls of the house (wood frame house). The picture quality is, can I say, better than Cable? yes. The selection of endless movies, documentaries. I can scroll down through types of things I want to see. I am only paying for my PBS Passport station through a donation that amounts to $5/month that allows me into an amazing array of viewing. I get my local TV channel every evening for news. If I miss the news time, I can see it again at 9, 10pm, whenever.  We don't watch too much on broadcast tv, can't stand the 40 minutes of commercials sometimes and 20 minutes of show.  After checking out the Roku experience for 4 weeks, we are going to cancel all TV with Comcast. We do need them for internet, but we can use 55 mbps from them and it will accommodate all streaming.  I think we will save $100 to 140/month!!  So easy to use. The remote turns the TV on and off, one simple remote.  Nice.

  I've never had a Roku before. This is well priced for what you get and the streaming is good quality. There are a few big caveats, though.The first is that Roku try to trick you into putting in a credit card. As you first sign up, the interface gives you no option to avoid this (!), but it actually isn't necessary to function. You have to stop your registration at the point they ask and restart the roku. Then, just log into the website. Works fine without the CC.  I guess marketing thought it was a good idea to force customers to give payment info.  It is kind of scummy.The second is that search is lousy.  Search within individual channels is awkward, and the main Roku search interface doesn't differentiate between movies on channels you already have, and movies on new channels they want you to subscribe to.  By mixing them all, they try to force you to sign up for more channels, I suppose, but it is at the cost of a easy to use search function.The third is that there is no general history or resume. If you stop in the middle of a movie there is no indication when you turn the machine back on of what you were watching or where you stopped. You have to remember to go back into whatever channel you were in, and look for the specific movie again.  Remembering current status is basic functionality, and the whole thing is made worse if you have more channels as Roku encourages.  Surely Roku could figure out how to resume properly. I purchased this for my elderly parents, all this lack of basic function makes their lives considerably more complicated. It is a shame, since those things would be so easy to do right and the streaming itself is fabulous.

  Loved it until it stopped working normally. Now i have to restart it everytime to watch. It would have overlapping screens, no way to watch unless i restarted the system everytime. It has been over 30 days and cant get a replacement because roku says to contact whoever sold it on amazon, but those people cant be contacted.

  Been using this for about a week now and overall I am really happy with it, but becareful of overheating and bandwidth use if your ISP is capped (mine is capped to 1.2TB per month which I need for other stuff too besides roku)Because of the overheating I had to add a fan near it and it dropped the temp from 82c to 66c in the secret screen (see pictures)to access the secret screen to see the temp hit this remote key combo:Home, Home, Home, Home, Home, Fast Forward, Pause, Rewind, Pause, Fast ForwardFor the bandwidth control you will want to go into your Router Settings (see last picture) and enable Traffic Management (QoS) and adjust the downstream to just enough for the Resolution you want to stream at, for me I use 1080p, and 3mbps down is just enough for 1080p streaming and I been able to stay around 15 to 20GB a day (0.5 to 0.8GB per hour) (450 to 600GB per month)Another thing you can do to save bandwidth is go into Roku Settings > Privacy > Advertising and check the box on ""Limit Ad Tracking"" and then restart the roku stick to apply the settingHave fun, hope this review was helpful

  This Roku Streaming Stick + has been a royal PITA since I first got it. First of all was the multiple instances in which I had to log in with a username and password just to get access to the various apps. I could understand being required to do this perhaps once for each app (to register for each service), but not multiple times for the same app. I am in the comfort and security of my own home on a password protected (automatic entry for all my devices ALL DAY EVERY DAY) wifi system. I am not worried about hackers or otherwise unauthorized use of their streaming service. Nor should Roku.Undoubtedly, the Fast Forward and Rewind functions are the most aggravating and infurating things about the service, or lack thereof. Both are either too slow or way too fast. And the 10 second rewind function (why no 10 second FFWD option-ignorant!) no longer works. It will freeze the picture and after a 10 second delay or so, it will pick up right back where you left off, with no rewind. And ostensibly, it should be additive, such that if I press this button 5 times, it will go back 50 seconds. But it doesn't do so. And trying to find your way back to a scene you missed for whatever reason is maddening. It takes the patience of a monk to endure the slowest rewind speed. And there is no rational progression beyond that for the next increments of FFWD or REW speeds. It goes into hyper drive on the second push, what is typically reserved for the 3rd or 4th press of the button. Moreover, I have encountered too many disruptions of service where the picture freezes during buffering. To top it all off, customer service is a nightmarish merry-go-round to get through.Don't waste your money. The Amazon firestick does not put me/you through any of this mess, delivers consistent performance, offers both a 10 second rewind AND forwarding function, does not make you log in multiple times (only had to do so twice; one other for Sling subscription initiation), has only frozen in buffering once or twice for less than 10 seconds each time and has a better interface (which helps you find the shows you'd be interested in quicker). Moreover, Amazon customer service is excellent and readily available for help. I had one instance in which I allowed their technician active X remote control. He quickly, quietly and politely resolved the problem. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ROKU DEVICE AS LONG AS I LIVE!!! I AM GOING TO STICK THIS POS ON A TV I RARELY USE, OR SELL IT TO SOMEONE ELSE AND LET THEM DEAL WITH IT!

  My first Roku I bought about a year ago. It just went out on me so I ordered a new 49.00 from amazon. When I went to set up on my Tv it gave an activation code and an error code when I tried to activate. A phone number popped up and I called it and it sounded like India. They said that there was a one time software update charge of 29.95 for her to activate my new device! And I would never have to do that again! I said absolutely not and took her name Tanya at Digistream I’m Tampa Fl.  Nothing in advertising about extra charges to activate! So I decided to get Roku customer service 816 272 8106. No longer working due to Covid! So I attempted to activate my device on tv again and this time I got someone who said they could activate but as of June they have to register new customers and it’s 200.00 for a year and 450.00 for 5 years!! I told her I’m returning this because it’s a scam and Roku is letting this happen. There is no customer support! DoNT BUY! This just happened to me on July 16 2020.  I'm still waiting to see my return is settled!

  I can't tell you how much I love this Roku compared to Amazon Fire Stick. It is AWESOME and so easy to use and set up. Everything from the packaging to the contents of the box is quality and I love that I don't need 14 remotes to watch streaming tv. Roku even comes with instructions to set it up, but really, it is so simple. You can go online and watch tutorials from Roku and so much more.I had two Fire Sticks and neither one worked with Hulu and the stick got really, really HOT when streaming live tv. I wasn't crazy about the quality of Fire Stick either, Roku is night and day and with so many more features.I read the reviews on Amazon by the guys who I felt really know what they are talking about when it comes to streaming and comparisons. When I read that CNET also recommends this fire stick I was sold, especially after all the problems I had with Fire Stick. I LOVE Amazon and Prime but the Fire Stick was a bust for me in so many ways.I am so glad to be rid of cable and their hideous bills for getting nothing to watch and a ton of aggravation. Optimum raised my basic cable bill $30.00 after 4 years of loyalty and I was DONE!! Streaming is the future and the way to go.I have a 3 yr old Samsung Smart Tv 1080P and this Roku stick works great plus I am ready in the event I decide to get a 4K tv. Don't hesitate a minute. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the Roku sticks.

  I'm SO glad I got this! 100x better than our fire stick. The picture quality is outstanding! We can get ALL the apps we were never able to before. The fire stick was so limited. We couldn't even get Vudu. And it's picture quality sucked. It would buffer too often. We have never, not once, had an issue with buffering with this Roku.(using the exact same internet and router) I only wish we would have made the switch much sooner! We love the free Roku channel on it.We will be getting another one now that we cut the cord on cable.I highly recommend!

  I purchased this streaming stick because I was having trouble streaming content to my Sony Blu Ray player (Netflix and Amazon Prime).  It was so painful to try to watch streaming content and I was searching the internet to find some sort of solution.  I wondered if my internet provider was not giving me enough data speed and I also wondered if my wireless router was getting too old, etc.  Enter the Roku Streaming Stick+!  Now, I can stream anything and no problem.  I was absolutely shocked on how good my streaming is now.  I went with the plus model due to the fact that it claimed to have a better wireless reception than the regular streaming stick.  I don't know if I really needed the plus or if Roku is just that good, but I can report streaming content is not a problem anymore.  Now the Sony only play DVDs and BluRay discs.  Definitely recommend this.  The only thing negative to report is you cannot surf the internet with this or at least I haven't found a way to do that.  I have Firefox on my Android phone and on Roku and I can't seem to get that to work at all either.  I'm not worried about that because I usually don't surf the internet on my TV but it would have been nice to be able to stream shows from the websites of major networks like CBS (can't stream the free content you can stream on your laptop).

  This is my third Firestick.  I bought it because it was the latest generation and my first generation had trouble with a couple of apps - dropping video, and audio not synced with video.  This corrected that problem (so far) but now every so often I get no audio.  The only way to fix this is to unplug the power to the transmitter for a couple of minutes to allow it to reboot.  Then, so far, the audio will come back on.  Not sure if this is a problem with just my device or if it might be inherent to all devices.  Other than that it works OK.Since my last review:Got two separate phone calls from Amazon.  The first was to verify that I had connected the device properly and to try different router settings.  This did not help.  But I did find that if I turned off the TV and then turned it back on most to the time the audio would then work.  On the second call from Amazon, they asked for all of the info regarding model of TV, etc., as they had similar concerns from other customers.A couple of days later another annoying problem came up.  During the playing of a video on the You Tube app, the video suddenly froze.  Tried turning on/off the TV with no success.  Tried other apps and they worked OK.  Opened You Tube on a different Firestick and a different TV and it worked OK.  Went back to this one and it still froze up.  Finally removed the power and unplugged from the HDMI port, let sit for about a minute, reconnected to the TV and then the You Tube app started playing again.  This is getting very annoying.  Hope Amazon can come up with a solution soon.1/27/21 - Amazon replaced this item with a ""reconditioned firestick.""  Within 4-5 days it started exhibiting the same problems.  Evidently this item was probably returned for the same problems, then marked ""reconditioned"" and sent to me as a replacement.  I've have spent countless hours on the phone with Amazon service reps, along with countless hours reconfiguring and then having to drive 70 miles to a UPS store to return the previous item.  Looks like I will be going through the same hassle again.  If Amazon would have just replaced this item with a new item possibly out of a better batch, I wouldn't continue having this problem.

  I bought this Fire Stick on a whim -  it was on sale. My old one has been kind of slow lately so I thought, what do I have to lose? It was only $17.I honestly did not expect much from it, but apparently Amazon's R&D team has done its homework. I was very pleasantly surprised how quickly I was able to set it up. It took me virtually 5-7 minutes - and that included the most time-consuming part - downloading software updates and installing them.The new Fire Stick is definitely faster than the old one. It downloads the content much faster, and the remote makes it much more responsive and user-friendly (unlike the 2017 version). You can tell the difference right away. I've used it only 30 minutes, but I am excited to report that so far I am very happy with it. Best spent $17 lately.

  Am called a technophile and tend to be an ""early adopter"". The idea of streaming TV has been around for a while the first I encountered (#6) was over a decade ago but the recent ""stay at home"" order combined with really inexpensive big screen TVs (have an advt for a 75"" 4k for $228 from a big box) coupled with really high speed Internet (over 50 Mb/s) means all systems are go.Bought the Firestick lite to fill in a gap with my TCL tv in the guest bedroom: no HBO MAX. This is the main reason for a four star for the Firestick - no Charter/Spectrum app. Since I have the four biggies: Spectum, Amazon Prime, Disney +, and HBO MAX the fact is no one device I've found has all four here at the end of 2020.Other than that the Firestick is better than most. Like an Android TV it can attach a keyboard through BlueTooth something the #6 cannot. These small remotes make a search or even channel selection with a multichannel provider difficult.One other thing of note: it needs quite a bit of power. Some streaming sticks can be plugged into the TV USB for power. This Firestick would load but then constantly restart so almost nothing could complete. Once I connected it to the included wall wart everything was fine.One other note: the BR TV is about 60 feet and one floor from the wireless router. By itself the speed was around 8 Mb/s which should be fine for 1080 HD. For 4k I suspect a range extender might be needed but on a 43"" is not an issue. Wrapping my hand around it tripled the download speed.So it is almost great and for many it would be but for now I still need two streaming devices to receive what is available.ps are a number of online workarounds for the Spectum/Charter issue. Ones I tried all wound up with the app bleating for an update that is not available.

  I've had terrible luck with various previous models constantly disconnecting from my wifi (while no other devices had this issue) and showing the ""Home is Currently Unavailable"" error over and over. I couldn't even get through to movie without having to restart my Fire Sticks. I have since moved over to ROKU devices and all has been well. I took the chance at the Fire Stick again because of the sale and so far I haven't had any disconnects. This one seems to be working much better so far. I wish it had the controller the more expensive models do, but whatever, it works. The center ""select"" button is very wiggly and making a jiggling clicky noise when you barely touch it, so I'm expecting that to stop working eventually. Otherwise, the picture is fine and I don't have any other issues.

  ordered 2 of these one for each of my kids room both were defected would go to a black screen the back button would stop working and would freeze then asked for a replacement which lately i Been having issues with either receiving my orders or with the workers not knowing what they’re doing and being on the phone for hours back and forth on hold etc. I don’t feel that this is appropriate being a prime member paying all that money for a year either to not receive your order as in it’s saying it’s out for delivery then all of a sudden is marked as undeliverable and being automatically sent back to the seller and being automatically refunded or having defective items and you’re on the phone for hours not happy never had these issues before always loved amazon but  then the replacement didn’t Work so yet again had to call Amazon to troubleshoot the replacement so I ended up having to send three fire sticks back yet again be on the phone for a long time frustrated aggravated hopefully this does not continue to happen because this was way too much aggravation and stress that was not necessary and thankfully the few people who I did get in contact with who actually did know what they were doing made it much more easier than dealing with the people who wasted my time and did not know anything

  When I saw the fire stick lite available for only $18 I decided to grab one to pair with a video projector I recently purchased.  The lite version has all the features of my previous generation fire sticks (including Alexia voice control) so I had to do a little research to learn that it's called lite because it doesn't allow you to control your TV or stream 4K video.  Neither of those functions are a big deal to me so I was able to save $10-$20 relative to the higher tier fire sticks.  I've used it several times now and it does a great job of streaming Amazon Prime content.  I haven't had any performance issues at all relative to slow response times or buffering.  I can't comment on its WiFi performance, I bought an adapter that allows me to connect the fire stick directly into an Ethernet jack so network performance has been great.My only criticism is the fire sticks physical design.  Ever since the first generation the fire sticks usb port has been on the side.  When you plug the fire stick into the back of a TV or an A/V receiver the usb cord sticking out the side of the fire stick limits where you can put it and/or what you can plug in beside it.  It can sometimes end up eating 2 ports because you can't plug in anything beside it.  It would have made a lot more sense to me to put the usb port on the back of the fire stick so that the cord would be less in the way.To make matters worse the latest generation fire sticks are a bit wider than the old ones.  Now I don't know if there are any industry standards on HDMI port spacing but on my Yamaha receiver the width of the fire stick is great enough to block the HDMI ports on both sides so unless I use the fire stick in the right most port it ends up eating 3 ports.  Even when using the fire stick in the right most HDMI port it still makes the adjacent port unusable.

  I am not tech savvy, but most of the reviews said this was so easy, that I took a chance.  All I wanted was access to Prime Video, but that did not show up as an option -- what did show up was channels I already have -- HBO and Starz.  After 2 days of messing around with this, I finally figured out I had to actually add the channels for which I already had subscriptions, and THEN it offered Prime Video.Also, I thought the Firestick would simply plug in like a thumb drive, but it actually has a black electric cord, so if you have a wall mounted TV, be prepared for a black cord to hang out the bottom of the TV.Finally, I have to use 3 different remotes to use Firestick.  One to switch the HDMI connection, one to adjust the volume, and the fire stick remote to move around the Firestick app.Now that I've worked out the issues, I am enjoying watching Prime Video on a large screen, rather than my laptop.

  This review is for the ""Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote"". I have 2 Roku 3s and have used them happily for years but their one downfall is that I can't stream facebook video with them. On black Friday this year, this product was on sale for 19.99. I figured at that price, why not give it a try? Lots of local musicians have been posting live video to facebook during the pandemic and I have been confined to watching them on my desktop - until now!The user interface for the Fire is intuitive and easy to use. It ""fired"" right up when I plugged it into my flat screen and as a welcome surprise, a lot of the apps I already had installed on my Kindle Fire tablet installed by default on the tv stick. Very slick! I opened Facebook on my phone, found a video, and was able to cast it to the Fire TV stick very easily. I did have to install the Facebook Watch app, but once installed, it made it even easier to watch videos from that platform. It also worked seamlessly with my Plex server (a must-have feature) and all the standard streaming services like Amazon video, Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube. I would recommend this as your central streaming device for sure!

  The Lite version of Fire TV stick is only light on certain features. So, what’s missing?* TV/AVR control* Dolby Atmos Audio (HDMI pass-through)That’s it. In essence, we are talking convenience factor. You will need your TV remote for volume and input selection. These can be overcome using Alexa voice remote or a Fire TV blaster. I like the simplicity of a single remote, so the extra $15 is worth the convenience of the Fire TV stick over the Lite version.It operates the same as the other sticks, although the new UI/OS changes the way 3rd party apps are added (still allowed, just different). The new UI allows for individual customization of app selection and order. This is ideal for those who only watch a few channels/apps and for those easily frustrated hunting through endless rows of options.Use this product for TV in your RV, office, patio, or bathroom en-suite with an older model television. The picture is great and the stream reliable. Move up to the standard version to add TV/sound bar control.

  I've never been a fan of the Fire TVs/Sticks compared to other streaming devices, but had started using one since HBO Max and other apps weren't available on the Roku.  I just ordered this FireStick for a downstairs to TV, but had been using a previous years model without too much issue on another TV.I set the new TV Stick is installed 3 feet from a large home router with high speed broadband.  It took several attempts to connect.  When restarting the FireStick it reports no connection on startup then finds the router about a minute later.  Tring to launch HBOMax takes 6 minutes for the main interface, another 5 minutes to start a program, then it freezes every 5 seconds.  I use the older model FireStick 50 feet away from the same router without this problem.Also can not use ESPN app on the FireStick, since it will not accept SlingTV provider login.  It looops back to a blank login page after  entering credentials (which is a painful process with the FireStick onscreen login page and remote).

  I bought this solely so I could listen to audible on my tv, if I had known that I couldn't browse my library and that audible is controlled solely by voice command, I never would have bought it. Besides the audible issue, firestick tv really sucks, it's very chaotic, if you want access to everything, I would save up and get the nvidia shield pro, if you want something close to the best minus hbomax, buy a roku 4. Firestick tv misses the mark on everything.

  You get what you pay for, in this case you get a 20$ piece of complete trash. Where do I start, how about the audio: I’ve never had a more incompatible device. Want to use Bluetooth headphones? Tough. Unless you want them blasting in your ears at full volume you need headphones with on board volume control. Now if you have headphones with on board volume control they will work but they will sound like utter crap and in my case the audio only comes out of the left channel (skullcandy wireless headphones). It also pops, cracks and cuts out every 10-30 seconds and has insane audio lag that constantly changes, so expect to mess with your TVs lip sync feature (if it has one) about 2-5 times and hour. I’ve also tried to connect a Bose Mini BT speaker. It connects but has the same pop/click issue. I tried using the aux-in on the Bose and my TVs audio out with zero sound. So enjoy your crappy tv speakers.The video: the video quality is pretty awful. I get weird red scan lines and all sorts of other glitches. It has major frame rate drops...I’m sorry why does this piece of crap exist from one of the biggest tech companies in the world? And every new version seems to be worse. I have an older version that does not have the same video problems but same with the audio issues. Save your money and buy something better. Or if you buy it don’t even open it. Just put it right in the trash.

  The older similar device this one is replacing rarely had trouble with wifi/internet connections. This one never wants to launch Hulu. Or it will start and then give a message about ""can't find"" or ""can't connect to that service at this time"". Or it asks me to login to the services again. In both cases making it restart fixes it for a while. Sometimes Echo Dot can control it, sometimes it says I should go back to the Alexa app.This one is supposed to be the one without TV? Or maybe not replace the TV's remote. I don't know. I don't need either.It's the layout of the buttons. Logically the Home button should be at the top or the bottom (larger?) so you don't have to look to press it. No, they put it up from the bottom, between other buttons so I have to look each time. The one at the bottom, I don't know what that is. Something to do with live TV.It does feed a nice picture and clear audio to my old Sharp TV.

  I've been using this a few months now.Pros (when it works):1. It streams some apps better and faster than the same apps via smart TV.2. Alexa's voice recognition has a pretty high accuracy, though there's room for improvement.3. The device is easy to set up.4. It's a good workaround for older TVs with specs too outdated for some channels, like iMDB TV.Cons (here we go):1. No disabling/adjusting sleep mode. Amazon refuses to add an option to turn OFF sleep mode, despite being given legit use cases for doing so in Amazon forums for the last couple of years. Want to leave it on for pets when you go out? Forget it. Have a business where the display needs to remain on? Nope. Or maybe you're like me and forget the TV is on because the screen is black. CAN I JUST SAY HOW ANNOYING THIS IS? You either have to root it, or install a 3rd party app (some of which also disable the screen saver).2. Interface text is SMALL. Like, really, REALLY unnecessarily, stupidly small. The last update did this, and there was no functional reason for it, just a designer decision of aesthetics over user need. So I guess older users, those with distance vision issues, or who have to place the TV a distance away don't matter.3. Given the brief time I've had it, I've had to restart it more often than I should have to. Captions will stop syncing up, audio will go out, or the video will freeze. This is while using Prime or Netflix, which BTW doesn't happen when I use the same apps installed on my Smart TV.4. The controller is small and very black, so it's super easy to lose, especially if you watch TV in low light or have dark furniture. I've had to add bits of fluorescent duct tape and glow tape so I can find them easier (or you can buy a brightly-colored silicone skin for it). And it's too curved to be able to stick any kind of location tag to it.I bought two, so obviously I didn't hate it. But this lack of responsiveness to good use cases and making changes nobody asked for that makes it less user- friendly are real issues.UPDATE: 4 months in and one is already broken. How convenient, when the warranty is 90 days.After about a minute, the screen freezes, and then the Fire Stick powers itself off completely! (Tried clearing the cache, soft reboot, hard reboot, restart the TV, even a factory reset - and problem persists.) Really, REALLY disappointing. Before this happened, I was seriously considering an Amazon Echo. Forget THAT.

  I have a generation 1 FireStick. I didn't use it much, it was so sluggish to move from menu to menu. Since I'm now working from home, I decided to monitor my surveillance cameras with the Firestick.  I have 5 1 megapixel cameras, and have 2 different programs I can use: tinyCam Monitor PRO and Onvifer Pro.I use these 2 interchangeably on my Note 8 with no troubles.  The cameras are on my lan, so the internet is out of the picture.The Firestick (gen 1) was not up to the task, video sometimes would freeze, it was never smooth, and was pretty much always pixelating on any motion or just crashing, so I decided to upgrade to the latest gen of Firestick.  This device is MUCH smoother moving between menus, and is a much more enjoyable experience than the earlier version. The surveillance camera software is much better, its usable for the most part, still some choppiness and alot of lag, so I was disappointed with that, and they only crash once or twice in 8 hours.  The device sits 4 feet from the wireless source, and its a 5g link, checking the connection reveals no connection problems, and can't be the source of the lag, so that points to hardware.  Plex seems to work better on this one better than the original one.  Overall, its an improvement over gen 1, and perhaps I don't use it as intended, since I don't use it for entertainment, but I expected better performance.

  I'm still unsure. I haven't used it long, and consistently enough to know, howeverI started running a similar problem with this ""lite"" model that I had with my other Fire stick.APPARENTLY, your power adapters are faulty, as each one of them has run into the same issue, they don't produce enough power to power the unit consistently, so it either drops the programming or it goes into the ""update"" or ""download"" mode repeatedly.Once I replaced the adapter with a better quality power adapter the units worked fine.Here's the rub, I'd like to use my adapters for their specific device, so I have to swap it out for the stick when I want to watch Prime or any other app.I checked on AMAZON for a replacement and you want $20 for one. That's insane as the stick only cost me $18. No wonder so many people have reported issues with them, THE ADAPTERS DONT FUNCTION PROPERLY & $20 for a replacement is just wrong?Where's your quality control & customer service?

  I have a very good surround system centered on a Denon AVR and multiple speakers.  All my surround sources go to the AVR which handles the surround audio and the video is sent to an LG OLED TV.  I want to be able to watch HBO Max movies in surround and initially bought a Chromecast which is supposed to be able to do surround but could not get it to work.  Saw many comments online having the same problems.  Spoke to their support but no joy.  Returned the Chromecast and bought this and it works PERFECTLY!!  I didn't want TV volume control as I have a universal remote to take care of that so this Fire Stick Lite is perfect.  The only down side is that the Fire Stick remote is not IR  so I cannot have my universal remote (which is IR only) control it.  But other than that it works very well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you want surround audio.

  Yep.  Keep getting the error 41 with anything viewable on Disney +.  I can get to the Disney + main screen and view all of the videos that are options - but as soon as I choose anything to watch I get the Error code 41.  Doing research, it lead me to believe that my wifi wasn't strong enough. Okay; possibility since my EA8300 is in the basement... bought an extender and installed/configured.  The extender is 15 feet away... Firestick states that wifi signal is very good.  Speedtests on my phone show 95mbs download.  Let's try Disney + again.  Nope.  Same freaking error.  Then I tried my 7 year old laptop.  Yep.  Disney + works just fine.  To any and all other peripherals = no problems at all.  Firestick?  Sucks.  Really... Disney + is the only reason I bought the Firestick.  Now what???Edit: through a massive internet search, I found the real problem with accessing Disney + via the Fire TV Stick... it has an issue with IPv6 on some routers. If you find yourself with the same issue I had, turn off the IPv6 or set it for pass-through. Viola!

  Works Great and have been using Roku Products since 2010. There seams to be some confusion as to what all the unit comes with, so I have attached a picture. It does have a special power cord with a built in antenna, so you cannot a standard USB to Micro USB TV Adapter. That is why they use the older style mini USB Plug into the Stick instead of the more common Micro USB Plug like is used on the Amazon Fire Sticks and the other Roku Sticks.

  1 year review update:Boy was I wrong about Roku being a solution. After a year now I can say with certainty that rokus own technology - hardware and especially software - are the very things youll be fighting with daily. This is horrible tech and theres no solutions here, just more problems than youve already got.Frequently dropping wifi, constant HDCP issues and settings that keep ""forgetting"" themselves, crashes all the time and all manner of streaming issues. Sometimes the picture is so pixelated I cant make it out, like it's a dying VCR tape or something - and Ive got 60M meg downstream cable internet service. Roku is the only platform that makes netlfix, hulu and sometimes Youtube an absolute chore to watch in comfort.My roku 4k plus Roku Streaming stick is garbage and a waste of time. I want to burn it, like in a fire. Thats how unhappy I am with Roku.Old review:Roku does a good job, and it kinda the Peacemaker of streaming platforms. Ok, yes the User Interface sucks and is pretty non-uniform/inconsistent in design, but the technology is GREAT and most importantly Roku is the only neutral ground for TV cable-cutter streaming services. Playstation has Vue so theyll never allow DirectTV Now or Sling or YouTube TV apps on PS4/PS5 etc, Amazon has their streaming services so they also ban certain direct competitors apps, same with Google TV devices and Apple TV etc...Most hardware manufacturers also have their own competing streaming services or have exclusive deals with one of them, and so they actively prevent and ban any competition from their platform, forcing the customer to use the one available option. Roku is like Switzerland - independent and neutral, without a directly competing service... And so EVERYONE makes a Roku app, and in that sense Roku is a fair free-trade zone, where quality and value of a given service is the only way to beat a competiting app... Roku is a neutral space where all the dirty tricks various companies use to force you to exist solely within their own software ecosystem don't have any reach. A pure free market, allowing the customer to win no matter how cutthroat the varied service providers want to be. Roku is the sherrif that keep Corporate greed at bay in a way. Worth dealing with the frustratingly poor UI design.

  Just been using Roku stick plus for a week and need time to get use to it from cable remote.  The first day even plugged to wall outlet, I got insufficient power message. I chat with customer service and she was very helpful. I unplug from tv and let it charge for 15 mins. That was it and now it's charging through tv usb without the message. The stick is warm, but I think that's normal. For tv, I subscribe to Directv Now. I have to scroll through the channels and can't type in channel numbers like I use to. I can't use voice command to change channel either, Roku will take me out of live tv and open a corresponding App to that channel instead. Roku app doesn't allow me to change channels at all while watching tv. It would also be great if it has a mute button.My Roku came with remote with different short cut keys than shown: Netflix, Hulu, Sling, and Vue. I rather have one with NOW as shown.The good? Savings of 50% on cable, our household watches 16 channels but we need a package of 220 channels from Xfinity to get all the 16 that we watch regularly. On top of that no more equipment rental fees, except for modem/router...(next on shopping list).

  I have owned this unbelievable piece of technology for about 10 days so please give my review the weight you deem appropriate.  So far,  I only have two complaints.  The mute button on the remote is poorly located and too easily accidentally pressed and occasionally the remote is a little sluggish in responding.  Easily connected, setup and activated, the device provides a mind-numbing number and variety of apps and channels with excellent picture and audio.  For those who choose to connect directly to av receivers I recommend you set the device audio to Dolby Digital plus. You will then enjoy multi-channel sound where available.  You may also need an hdmi extension cable. Although Roku will send one free of charge upon request it’s only about 4 inches long and practically useless. Amazon sells several and I purchased a 6ft one from UGreen that works perfectly.  I power my stick from a USB jack on the TV.  Roku recommends using the supplied adapter and connecting to an electric socket so it remains powered on at all times eliminating start up delay.  However, it only takes a few seconds to power on from the USB connection and this method also eliminates any heat build-up (however marginal) when the TV is off.  Some may argue that having the unit fire up every time the TV is turned on is likely to reduce longevity.  Of course this is the same argument advanced for computers and some other electronic devices.  I’ll leave that choice to you after noting that heat is a nemesis of electronic devices of virtually all kinds.  Use the power option that works for you.  Once set up you can literally spend hours just surfing through the staggering number of apps and channels.  Absolutely amazing device.  I’ll follow up if my opinion changes.

  Had to update my review - every day - multiple times a day - my Roku disconnects from the wifi.When I IMMEDIATELY go through the prompts - it tells my wifi strength is either Good or Excellent and lets me reconnect.  Anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour later - it happens again. BEYOND frustrating.I should also note - when it happens - I'm pretty much sitting in front of TV with my laptop - connected to wifi - and my laptop connection is fine / untroubled.  This fact - coupled with the fact that it immediately allows me to reconnect leads me to believe that this is a Roku issue - not an issue with my ISP or wifi signal / strength.I even followed some steps on a YouTube tutorial (basically rebooting / refreshing via Settings) and that hasn't helped.Complete waste of my money.  I'm so angry with Roku right now.Like a lot of folks, I have Comcast, and I, therefore, have an insane monthly cable / internet bill.  So, of course, I'm always looking for ways to cut the cord OR save some money while I'm still cable bound.I'd read an article about how some enterprising folks were using Roku and the Comcast app - which is free, right now - but it's in beta stage - to save on cable rental fees.  I have 5 cable boxes (in addition to the DVR) - so I decided to give Roku a try - primarily to check out how it works as an option to get rid of my cable boxes.The set-up did NOT go off without a hitch.  When I entered my network password, initially, it accepted it, and a message appeared on the screen letting me know that the system needed to re-start to complete the installation. I was thinking, 'Wow! That was insanely quick!'But then . . . when it re-started, it kept telling me that my password was incorrect.  This went on for about 2.5 hours.  No exaggeration.  I knew my password was correct.  So I just continued working (I was parked on the couch with my laptop before starting the process) and re-tried the password every 15 minutes or so, and magically, all of a sudden it accepted the password and I finished the set-up.Ultimately, I think the product is 'Okay' - but I would never put on the two TV's we use for heaviest viewing.  That's because I'm not crazy about the actual interface. The TV I tried out with today is only a 42 inch - so the massive tiles (for channels) make it difficult to quickly scroll through and get to the channels you want.  I tried using the voice function to quickly navigate to the channel I wanted, but that, too, proved cumbersome.  For instance, (fictitious channel example - lol) let's say I searched for the 'SAL' channel.  It might return results of 'SAL Channel, 'Salads television show' and 'Sal and Andy Solve True Crimes show.'  So I scroll down to the 'SAL Channel', and click Ok, then it takes me another screen, where I have an option to Add the SAL Channel.  Even though I've already added it.  SO you click Add, then it opens.So after trying it out for a few days, I'll definitely keep it.  For my office, I got some inexpensive speakers for my computer and that TV is already hooked up as a second monitor so it was just a simple matter of logging into computer and viewing my line-up.So back to what I was saying - why I would never put the Roku on a TV I use heavily - because:1) no voice remote option - no way to manually enter a channel number - so you're scrolling to get to channels which can be kinda cumbersome*2) no way to schedule a recording - you can view recordings now (I guess they won that lawsuit sling TV had against them) - but not schedule them.3) You cannot pause or rewind Live TV and I do that (A LOT)So I plan to order a two more for the other TV's, and I'll wind up purchasing another Samsung TV for the fifth television - because unlike most Smart TV's - Samsung actually has a full-on browser - so you can surf / go to any website and just login / view.  It's pretty great - but that's another review . . .

  Worked great for six weeks but suddenly unable to connect to my wireless internet. I have a number of other things hooked to wireless and it’s working great. Tried to get support from Roku and it is non-existent!!!  There are MANY Roku owners experiencing the same problem and nobody is able to get any answers!!!  My Roku streaming stick + is now a useless piece of junk!!!UPDATE:  I was never able to get through to Roku so called Amazon product support.  They were wonderful and patient as they guided me through trying to fix the problem. It became apparent the unit was defective. Amazon authorized a replacement unit be sent and I’m returning the defective one.  I so appreciate Amazon’s wonderful customer relations!!!

  We plug in our Roku streaming stick plus into the USB port of the TV. So, when we put the TV off, the Roku stick also goes off power. When you power on the TV again, the Roku starts up, and now, suddenly the remote stops working. To get it to work,  we have to get up, walk close to the TV and point it at the stick just behind the TV. Now it starts working, and will continue to work until the next power cycle. This is unacceptable! What was wrong with the infra-red remote? Worked just fine!Another peeve. I tried plugging the Roku into the wall outlet. So, lets say you're watching an Amazon Prime video, or anything else. You power off the TV, but not the Roku. The Roku continues to stream. This is a no-no. What if you're on a limited internet plan? Also, the cable company is itching to meter our internet, it just needs a justification. Wasteful streaming will provide just such a justification. On the other hand, the Amazon fire stick is smart on this particular issue. It stops streaming, it senses the TV is off.

  Roku streaming devices are wonderful in many ways. However, I’ve purchased two of these Streaming Stick-Plus’s, and I feel compelled to tell you about their less wonderful aspects: Both of the units I purchased failed pretty catastrophically. I needed their customer service to help me. And their customer service ranges from nightmarish to effectively non-existent.My first Stick+ failed after just nine days when the remote control just spontaneously completely died. I managed to get their so-called customer service to send me a replacement remote, but only after 7 completely solid, non-stop, super-ultra-nasty hours on text chat with them, including a lot of threats from me to send the whole thing back to Amazon for a refund (which is what I definitely actually should have done).My second Stick+ has overheating problems whenever the house warms up - despite good ventilation, added HDMI extender cable, etc., etc. I might possibly maybe be able to get it replaced under their supposed 1-year warranty, but, absolute best case, it would take many more hours of my time, and return shipping costs, and weeks without TV service, with no reason to expect any good outcome, just more very unpleasant, badly wasted time and money.Bottom line: You can be pretty sure you will have reliability problems and need service help with this product. But you should regard Roku’s warranty and support as non-existent, effectively just a scam, because it is. If you buy one of these units, be sure to try to flush out any problems within the first 30 days; and if you find any problems, just return it to Amazon, don’t waste your time with or expect any help from Roku.How badly can you treat your customers and still expect them to give you any credit?

  Luckily the scam I'm talking about is in no way Roku's fault. When setting up my Roku I attempted to pull the Roku site on my phone and punch in the code. Apparently there's either a REALLY good spoof website, or the actual one is somewhat infiltrated, because I got a message that my Roku was ""temporarily locked"" and that I needed to call them. I've set up a few of these devices before, so I was already on alert. I called the number and was set up with ""Roku customer service"" who offered to fix the device and get me started, but said they'd need to charge me a one-time fee to access over 50 Roku channels. If you've used Roku before you know this is not the case. We went back and forth a bit. The Roku setup screen even states that there is no fee to set up. I asked the ""technician"" about this, and they gave some excuse about how charging me money to activate me was not an ""activation"" fee. I was getting more suspicious, and requested a supervisor, which I'm not sure wasn't the same person. The ""supervisor"" offered me a ""supervisor's discount"" of $10. It's interesting to note that the base activation fee kept changing from $49 to $69. I eventually got very suspicious, told them I was investigating further, and hung up on them. I then went my desktop computer upstairs (which I was too lazy to do before) and activated the Roku that way, and was streaming in a matter of minutes.I Googled it later, and apparently it's a fairly common scam. Don't believe me? Look for yourself.Roku makes a wonderful product. My original ones are still running okay, but I've been upgrading a bit this year. I've been consistently happy with their performance. I highly recommend them. Just be careful when you go to register.

  This is important info. If you use a soundbar like I do, the Roku Streaming Stick, within 2 minutes of plugging in, with give a warning that it is overheating. If using a soundbar, please either get the free hdmi extender from Roku themselves or buy one that handles 4k. This is important info that I never saw in any reviews. The extender works fine, I just wish the product description would have mentioned it.

  It pains me to give a bad review to Roku because I have another Roku TV and I love it!  This is not a ding on the product itself, but more on the product page.  The product page neglects to explain the importance of HDCP 2.2 standard.  It is some sort of copyright protection technology so that you can't make recordings of 4k HDR streams.  Older TV's that are only 1080p compliant (basically anything older that 2013-ish) won't have the proper copyright ability and the Roku device won't work with it AT ALL. I wish that it was more explicitly explained in the product page that if you want Roku on an older 1080p TV, you have to buy the ROKU EXPRESS device, instead.  I had a very bad experience trying to get this to work on my non-smart TV. After several hours searching the internet, i finally learned of the problem.  I knew that my TV was not 4K, but I just thought that the steaming stick would just dumb down the quality for my TV.  I didn't think it would completely not work.

  We replaced our Firestick with one of these and we won't ever be going back. In the past few years, we've been through multiple Firesticks as they seem to only last a year or two for us before having problems and just failing. We would have connection issues constantly, dropping connection or just taking forever to load. Super slow loading of some apps, especially Amazon's own store (which doesn't make sense.. you'd think their product would load their own app quickly).Roku doesn't have any of these issues and the pre-programmed buttons on the front are great for us. Great streaming quality, never has slow load times, never lags, quickly cycles through applications and is a very smooth experience. The remote also controls turning our TV on/off and can control the volume. A really great, simple product that does exactly what it's meant to do.

  I am satisfied with the performance of the Roku Stick+, though it did require the addition of a wifi ‘range extender’ to improve reception. The device converts my ‘dumb’ TV to a ‘smart’ TV, allowing access to a wide variety of viewing options, including Spectrum, Netflix, etc. I can now use my laptop exclusively for work, while watching a TV program. A nice addition.I am not sure why the Roku device needs a signal booster to perform properly since my laptop (used next to the TV) and all other device work fine. When first installed, the Roku Stick+ wifi screen reported “POOR” signal strength. After the addition of the range extender (purchased some time ago on Amazon for about $20) the signal strength is now “EXCELLENT”. A bit confusing since the extender is located next to the TV in what would be considered an ‘undesirable’ location: floor level, between appliances, and horizontal. But, it works!The “Roku Stick+” is a replacement for the less expensive “Roku Stick” which failed to reliably connect: poor picture quality and frequent “reloading . . .” (buffering).

  Well I bought the device 60.00 dollars and set it up I needed a code to but in on the website so I did and yes it does not take it YOU have to call them to activate streaming. Okay on there own screen at the bottom stated no fees for activation or support! But then in the same breath they tell you - you have to pay them a one time fee of wait 130 dollars for 5 years 250 dollars for life time???? I just bought your product and you won’t let me stream anything without some kind of payment????? Then why does it say NO FEES for activation there is no trial period nothing they just want you’re money or No ROKU and customer service is horrible they told me to shut my mouth and hung up on me this went one for hours well if you can have to have this crap product so be it I’ll never buy one again FIRESTICK for me no hassle plug and play Hence I returned there scam stick HORRIBLE

  Remote and Roku stick would not communicate. After reading several online troubleshooting guides, concluded this is a common problem with this version. Going back to the regular cheaper version, which has always worked like a charm.

  Stuff I like:  Super Simple to use, supports 4K with HDR, much faster than previous models, can be plugged into a USB port on the television for power with the included cable, (preventing the need to buy the little $5 stick-to-USB cable to avoid using the AC cord), remote as always is so simple with only a few buttons and this one controls the TV on/off as well as the volume - though I still have four remotes for my TV!  :(Stuff I don't like:  Does not support Dolby Vision, remote has the sponsered one-touch pre-programmed buttons with channels most of us have no need whatsoever forI do use three streaming platforms on one television - Roku, Chromecast, and Fire Stick.Roku is by far the better of the three and this is my second Roku streamer.  The simplicity is what gives Roku the edge over the others.  Even though I've only used the iPhone app for my pre-existing Roku, the included remote is simple with only a few buttons and no clutter.  I do wish the ""included pre-programmed""  buttons, like the one-touch Netflix, Sling, Hulu, and Vue, (what the heck is VUE???) buttons were not there and instead we were given the option to add our own one-touch favorites instead of letting those companies pay Roku for the privilege.  It's just wasted space on the remote, except maybe for Netflix. Roku could have used one of those buttons for a much needed mute button for the volume.My favorite for supporting Roku over the others, and I'm sure many agree, is the extremely simple home screen.  Many web review sites say it could be called ""dated"" but in this case, it's welcomed and Roku's biggest asset.  It's too simple and attractive.  My favorite positive Roku has over the others is there is little to no bias whatsoever on the home screen as the others can add so much clutter, advertising, and pushing their sponsored marketing stuff on you.  I also like the idea that I can plug the power for the stick directly into an unused USB port on the TV to avoid using the included AC power cord and adapter.  Our TVs today have enough unsightly wires in the back from stuff as it is!My personal biggest negative with the Roku Streaming Stick + is it does not support Dolby Vision, only HDR10.  I can't figure Roku out on this, the days of regular 4K are far behind us and a televison without both HDR10 and Dolby Vision should ** never ** be considered if you're really into televison specs and display quality.  Thankfully my Vizio supports both Dolby Vison and HDR10 on Chromecast.  The lack of Dolby Vision is why I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5.  It would be nice if the remote would control my Vizio's input options in addition to the volume and power on/off buttons allowing me to put my Vizio remote away.Overall, for the price, quality, and features, this is an excellent streamer I highly recommend.

  I thought I would give Roku a try.  Should have stuck with Amazon Fire Stick, they are great and I have 3 already, and a Cube. The issue is..Before you can even use Roku, you have to go through so many steps to set it up, one of the bullets in the info states ""Setup is a cinch: Plug it in, connect to the internet, and start streaming--it's that simple""........IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE !!! you have to use your phone or PC, you have to give personal information, gender, birthday, email, address,  AND.....you have to set this up with a credit card. You have to give all of this information during set up before you can even stream, you can not go any further without all of this personal information.  I did not feel comfortable with doing this. I should have read all of the reviews first. Lesson learned.  Read all of the reviews  with a 1 and 2 stars, these customers are not exaggerating. I reported this to Amazon as misleading product information.

  First, the bad. It took me forever to figure out why the unit wouldn't connect at 5 GHz - it can't see ""DFS"" channels. In plain english, you need to select channels 37-48 or 149-161; it can't see any channels between.Now the good, this thing is awesome! It boots quickly, can run off of USB power from the TV, and the addition of volume control and TV power are fantastic. We cut the cord and only use Roku for content - now we have only one remote that can do everything, including search for content using voice. The user interface is significantly improved from previous generations. It is very simple to use, even my four-year-old has no problems.Overall, I get it 4.5 stars. The 5 GHz channel issue is easily compensated. Otherwise, is perfect.

  I moved my Samsung smart tv where there was no cable outlet, and where it would have been to expensive and messy to install one. Then I downloaded the Spectrum streaming app. I experienced annoying buffering. I tried various solutions without success. I was almost to the point where I was ready to give up. When I read that Roku long-range wireless receiver gave you extended range and a stronger signal for smooth streaming even in rooms farther from your router I thought I would give it a try. My router was upstairs, and far from my tv. My extender didn't solve the problem. I downloaded the Spectrum app on the Roku and I experienced immediate success. It's been about two weeks and I haven't experienced any buffering on Spectrum.

  Recently decided to try and ditch the cable bill and use a tv streaming service (yttv). One big thing to note is that the power button only turns the tv on/off (via IR). If you've got a 1080p stream going and push that power button, you will continue to eat up your internet bandwidth to the tune of up to 50GB/night. I came to this realization a bit too late. All you have to do is be sure to hit the ""home"" button before shutting off the tv. Easy to remember, extremely difficult to put into practice with a revolving door of toddlers and guests accessing the tv.A second option would be to power the device via USB power from the tv, but this means a reboot of the device every time the tv is power cycled - this is far from ideal when considering boot time plus remote pairing time. Far too long for my taste.I much prefer this unit to the fire stick that has screen after screen of Amazon content and no (official) yttv support. The interface is the best I've used on a streaming device (fire stick, roku, shield tv).I'm removing a star based on two things:1) the remote interface for a consumer looking to stream tv. An option to trigger a ""home"" button push with every power button push would be super... or hold the home button for some time to trigger the IR to shut off the tv... Just something to couple those two buttons somehow. Maybe even put the device into a standby mode/home screen based on HDMI CEC when the tv shuts off. I just hate that a tv power button was included on the remote that doesn't function the way a traditional tv power button functions.2) no sound bar volume support. Tvs get flatter, speakers get worse necessitating external sound, and this remote cannot support it. Boo. Fire stick does.Regarding #1, Sure, the tv streaming app could include a timeout option, but the ideal scenario to me is to stop all streaming when I command the display off. Certainly music streamers would not prefer such a feature, so to me, the ingredients lead me to believe this should be an option.Very good product, just not very good for me.I literally cannot afford to use this device to stream tv due to this functionality combined with the occupants of my home.

  This is a reliable steaming device that seems to be compatible with any TV that has HDMI ports.  It is a rather bulky stick that does not fit into HDMI slots that are close together (as on many TV's).  A short ""dongle"" cable is included in the package, so the stick then dangles on the back of the TV.  However, this seems not to be much of a problem.  Like the current ROKU streaming sticks, this stick also requires a separate power cable and power brick, so you'll need an available AC socket.  Unfortunately, plugging the power cable (without the brick) into my TV's USB socket produced an error message, so I was not able to simplify the wiring in that way.  This ""lite"" version of the Firestick does not have audio control buttons.  I think that is both an advantage and a limitation, in that it avoids compatibility problems with your soundbar (a problem I had with another version of the Firestick).  Bottom line is you'll need to use your TV remote to control the audio volume.The user interface is pretty easy to navigate, though I think not as elegant as the interface for TV's having built-in Fire support.  The voice commands generally work well, and this seems like a definite plus for a device in this price range.  The Firestick Lite also integrates with Echo Dot devices.  This is not really useful if the Dot is in the same room as the TV but could be valuable if the Dot is in another part of the house.I think it is useful to compare the Firestick Lite to the ROKU Express (the comparable non-4K ROKU streaming device).  The available streaming platforms for both devices seem pretty much the same (HBO Max, Showtime Anytime, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc.), though it looks like ROKU may have a few more of the obscure platforms.  I was able to download the Criterion Channel on both a ROKU Express and the Firestick.  On the day Discovery Plus launched in January 2021, ROKU had it available, but the Firestick did not.  However, a week later, the Firestick did have it. The ROKU user interface is simpler and I think easier to use than the Firestick interface.  Both devices have a search function, though ROKU's seems to work a bit better.The bottom line is that the Firestick is a very reasonable alternative to ROKU devices.  I would not pick either the Firestick or ROKU on the basis of channel availability, since both are excellent in this regard.  If voice control is important for you, the Firestick is a good choice.  If you are a big fan of the Amazon Prime channel, you may also prefer the Firestick, because its user interface focuses on that channel's content.  If you don't use Amazon Prime, then you may find that the ROKU user interface is a better fit for you.

  THIS IS THE SMARTEST MOVE I'VE MADE IN MONTHS! The Firestick Lite bears a bit of comparison to the 4K Firestick ...A year ago, I agonized over which Firestick product would be best for me.  I decided that forward-thinking would be best and went with the 4K Firestick, even though nothing is broadcast or streamed in 4K YET.  It turns out that embracing the newest technology is a huge trade-off.  Sound, picture quality, bells and whistles are great, BUT ... FYI:  4K IS A BANDWIDTH HOG!!!!!!!!  It doesn't matter what your speed is.  It could be 200 Mb and you'd still have buffering and dropped connectivity issues. What matters is how many connected devices you have along with other wireless connections near you.  HARD LESSON LEARNED: THE RING DOORBELL is a signal thief and only before and after the one nearest me was installed/uninstalled could I watch anything on the 4K Stick for more than a few seconds or minutes at a time.So, when Amazon offered this Lite version of Firestick at an unbeatable sale price, I was torn about whether to even bother with it or just  bite the bullet and buy  a second 4K Stick.  I mean, if the 4K is an issue, the Lite version had no hope.  Right?  WRONG!  I figured the Lite version might just be less of a drag on bandwidth and speed, and it is.  I've been running it straight for almost 24 hours hours I've been live steaming TV and playing movies and shows on Prime, Netflix, Starz, Pluto, CBS All Access, etc.  NOTHING HAS BUFFERED, STOPPED, STUTTERED, DROPPED THE CONNECTION.  It reminds me of the old days when I stayed at 3 Mb when everyone else topped out at 15 and I streamed everything smoothly because I was the only car on the slower freeway so to speak, while everyone else was crammed into the newest, fastest highway.Well, the Lite is pure DELIGHT.  The same pieces as the other sticks:  the stick, the extender, the adapter connector to the outlet, and the Alexa-enabled remote.  This remote won't control the TV but it does everything I need.  I prefer individual remotes anyway, and it's in the bedroom so any shortcomings won't matter.  I never pre-link my Amazon devices, but setup is an easy snap.  Just  manually input the wireless Network key and you're set.  Add the desired standalone apps you want and start streaming.Some reviewers also complained about the unavailability of YouTube.  It's on there. I'm not missing anything that I have with the 4K Stick, but I have gained the luxury of nonstop streaming which has been a setback for the 4K stick.  Now I'm comparing the streaming on the 4K stick and any interruptions to the flawless run I've had on the Lite Stick.  If it goes down as expected, I just may buy another Lite Stick and use it in the living room as well.  the difference in sound and picture is negligible to me at this point without full 4K, and I want smooth streaming now more than a future benefit.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS STICK.

  UPDATE:After writing the original, negative review Amazon tried to shame me via text, voice-mail, and email -- 'cause it must be my fault, right? Thing is, after the negative experience with the Fire stick, I bought a Roku stick and it works really well: no lag on the controller and a good UI/UX -- just like the old FireTV.Sorry Amazon, it isn't your consumer's responsibility to fix your product.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Loved my old Fire TV. I only upgraded because an app I wanted wasn't supported on the old one.WTF happened?The controller lag is ridiculous -- it can take a second or more for it to respond. Lot's of fun to enter a username or password, let alone just trying to navigate menus.Then, there's the whole UI/UX. Tedious and painful are the two words that come to mind.Run away. Run away.Lab126 has definitely jumped the digital shark.

  ****I am editing my review after initially, I wrote this review and got call from Amazon customer support person again to get some issues fixed.****1. Unable to install Sling Tv app : This issue was resolved as initially my account was set to different country than USA and issues fixed when I login using USA account.2. Support guys told this is 1st generation device. This is ok as it's 1st gen (lite) among other varients.3. Unlike other versions of fire stick support guy is unable to take remote contol of fire stick to troubleshoot issues. This was resolved after I update my account to USA.

  I received this item and had no trouble setting it up. But the next day it started occasionally freezing up and not responding to the remote. On the third day the stick was completely unresponsive and would not even power on.I tried to get a replacement, thinking it would be easy and straightforward but kept getting directed to a useless customer service bot that I'm sure eliminated lots of jobs. It kept getting stuck in a loop and could not even establish what product I had an issue with so I called and after more than 20 minutes of being put on hold repeatedly while they ""looked into the options"" I was able to finally convince someone to just refund my order. I don't even want a replacement at this point. The customer service strategy seems to be to try and prevent returns and exchanges as much as possible even by way of frustrating the user to the point they give up.

  Update 12/2/2020 - After using this for a couple weeks i went and disconnected both the Roku and Chromecasts for good. i've even stopped using the smart tv apps and only use this unless i happen to be watching something in 4K or 8K only then do i use the built in TV apps. i didn't expect much from a $17 dollar stick let alone that i would prefer it to all our other streaming media devices.We already had a Roku premiere plus 4K unit however we get dozens of OTA channels with our antenna and wanted something that could put all our media in one spot, using one device. should also note we had a couple chromecast dongles as well.The stick comes with what you need to get started. Batteries, charger, cable, hdmi connection and an hdmi extender for those who need one. If unsure how it all connects I included photos showing that. Ours was linked to our existing amazon account when it arrived. It was as simple to install as you could hope for, no rocket scientist needed so to speak.We have streaming services like YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, Netflix, CBS all access, etc. As said we also get a lot of OTA channels using our antenna thanks to our signal amplifier. Once setup is complete by pressing the ‘tv with rabbit ears’ you will go to the channel guide section. There it starts out with the OTA channels, then YouTube TV and so on.Also you have the ‘home’ button. That takes you to the main page showing all your media sources and recently used channels. There is a menu across the top with viewing options. On the far right as we have a recast device, there is DVR. So again everything all in one spot using one device, just what we wanted.The remote response is fast, much more than expected. Compared to the Roku premiere plus 4K response times it is blazing fast which honestly that surprised me. that considering the Roku cost 6X what I paid for this stick. Picture quality to my eyes is no different than if viewing using the stock smart TV apps or Roku device.Plenty of useful options and settings with the device. As mentioned we have the amazon recast and paired with this stick the two together are a wonderful. The first one worked so well I ordered a second for our mom. I only bring that up because she still cannot set the clock on her old VCR. Anything even remotely tech related means I get to do it for her.This fire stick and the remote are so well designed I was able to give her one. It took me all of ten minutes to show her how to use it. since she not only can use the fire device, tv how she wants and when she wants but it also gave her a little positive, confidence boost being able to use tech that before was always too complicated for her to use.The only minor negative is voice control. Sometimes it gets it right other times it doesn't but does get to the 'general neighborhood' so to speak.We got both of ours when they were priced at seventeen bucks. Well worth it and then some in all of our opinions in this household. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this to anyone. Those intimidated by tech or those like myself who simply want everything in one spot with one remote to access it all from.

  It was easy to install to my monitor HDMI port using the extender cable that was included with the kit. I needed the extender cable because the HDMI ports on my monitor are inset. So I'm glad that the extender cable was included. The instructions that came with it were easy to follow. And for good measure Amazon sent me more instructions via email after I ordered. I have an older gen1 Fire system that connect via cable that I use on our HTS where we have CAT6 installed. But wanted to add Prime video to another set. This works just fine for that, so I gave it 5 stars.  I understand that it doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but for what I needed it works just fine.

  Got the first fire stick - no picture. Followed Amazon support steps - no dice. They sent a second stick - this one was filled with static and the screen flashed in and out. I managed to complete the setup and got a clear screen by limiting the stick to 720p output.This is ridiculous. My older 2nd gen fire stick had no trouble outputting 1080p and there’s no reason this one shouldn’t either. Truly annoyed with Amazon and their “support”

  I was apprehensive when I bought this, simply due to the fact that the 'regular' version is so much more expensive.  I was almost convinced that, in purchasing this one, I would be missing some sort of critical feature, and would regret 'getting what I paid for'.I haven't.I'm now wondering why anyone would choose to pay double the price for the original version, when the only thing you are missing is the ability to power and adjust the volume on your television; this is something that I do with the proprietary TV remote anyway, as I would think most people would.  I still get every streaming feature, apps that I couldn't normally access on my Smart TV, e.g., Disney+, ease of use with the remote, and the voice command feature (which is something I did NOT have in my old FireStick).  I am missing nothing, and was able to save some cash while doing so.Amazon devices are always an easy 11/10 for me, and this one is no exception. It's a great, affordable option for those of us that don't sweat the extremely minor inconveniences of life.

  I've owned two other fire sticks and they've worked great. My daughter and granddaughter got them as well which I set up for them and they worked great for them as well. I purchased the new Firestick Lite and had it for awhile before I switched out my old one for this one that I installed just two days ago. When I opened the package, it wasn't sealed, the batteries were already in the remote, while all the others were separate in the box, and the protective plastic on the remote was missing which leads me to believe this item had been returned because someone definitely got into it before I did. I've had to restart it multiple times because it kept saying I didn't have an internet connection...which I did have each time. I restart the Firestick and it works for awhile but then does it again. It's definitely not my internet because all my other devices work. I don't know how this item was allowed to go out when it was obviously opened but I will be return this one.

  UPDATE: After writing the review, shortly thereafter I received a call from Amazon. Awesome BUT Creepy.  They wanted to offer a solution to my problem.  What?!! I couldn't speak at the moment and requested they email me.  I received the email and followed their instructions. It worked!!!  Great Customer Service!ORIGINAL REVIEW: Let's be honest.  Who doesn't like the price?  But, the issues I am experiencing is crazy.  Not sure if it matters, but when I am done watching TV, I normally turn off the TV.  I know--what a phenomenon! When I go to watch TV again, I will turn on the TV (Lite does not have power button) and wake the Fire TV Lite.  Sometime it will not wake (gray screen).  Most times, it will wake and function BUT without sound/audio!!!!!!!  No SOUND!!!I then have to reboot the Fire TV Lite in order for the sound to come back! This is GARBAGE!

  I have several Fire Sticks, Roku TVs, and a Roku Express.  I don't have a need for 4K so that feature, found on the more expensive models, is not important to me.  Price and basic performance are what counts.  The new FireTV Stick Lite delivers--especially at the current promotional price.All three of my basic Fire Sticks are standard models and identical in appearance with slightly different remote controls.  The oldest standard stick has the most basic features and no volume or power button.  The newer standard model has the same controls but with the addition of a power button, mute button and volume controls.  The newest Lite model removes the power and sound buttons, but adds a guide button, not on the other two.They removed the power and sound buttons on the Lite model.  With these buttons, I pretty much don't have to use the TV remote control at all.  For a few dollars more, you may want to consider the basic FireTV stick, just to get the power and sound buttons.  Just make sure that you are getting a newer model with these features, and not the original stick without these buttons.UPDATE 12/13/2020:  I discovered that you CAN control the TV Power ON/OFF with the Fire Stick Lite if your TV is CEC capable (most are.)  Pressing the HOME button on the Fire remote should turn the TV on and switch to the Fire input.  If the TV is already on, pressing the HOME button will switch to the correct input.  To turn the TV off, press the MIC button and say ""TV POWER OFF"" and it should turn the TV off.  Make sure that your TV HDMI settings have CEC control turned on for this hidden feature to work.  So far, I haven't been able to control the volume this way.All of the remote controls use RF (radio frequencies) to control the stick, rather than the usual infra-red (IR) controls found on TV remotes.  That means that they don't have to be pointed at the TV to work.  In fact, they wouldn't work with the Fire Sticks if they were IR remotes since the Stick sits behind the TV.  The downside to the RF remote is that they are specific to the individual stick.  The menu allows you to pair a new remote to the Fire Stick if you replace one.  You can also access the Fire Stick with your cell phone with the FireTV app.  This has come in handy when I've misplaced the remote control, or worn down the battery and not had a replacement.  By comparison, the Roku Express (and my Roku TVs)  use IR remotes that you have to point.  They are interchangeable, and the batteries seem to last longer than the RF remotes used with the Sticks.Performance, picture quality and speed are good on all three Fire Stick models.  The Lite model is the newest of the basic models and should have the fastest speed, but I haven't detected any difference.  To save on network bandwidth, I force all of my devices to operate at 720P.  The picture quality is quite good on my TVs (up to 50"") and pushing higher resolutions just wastes bandwidth, in my opinion.  However, picture quality is heavily dependent on the particular app and type of content being watched, so I can't really make any predictions how it will work for you.The FireTV Sticks plug directly into the HDMI connector on your TV.  A short extension cable is provided if there is not enough space for the Stick to be plugged directly in.  The unit is provided with a 5V  1.0 amp AC adapter and a short USB cable.  Amazon recommends plugging the stick in to a separate outlet, rather than using the USB jack on many TVs.  In fact, if the unit detects that the TV USB connector doesn't have enough amperage, you'll get a message telling you not to use it.  It's more convenient to use the TV to power the Stick but there are drawbacks aside from the lack of power.  The TV often turns off the USB connector when powered down, meaning that when you turn on the TV, the Fire Stick will have to reboot and reconnect to your network, slowing down your start-up.  It would also be possible, in rare instances, to accidentally power down your stick with the TV when an upgrade is being performed, which could cause problems.  All that said, I still use the Fire Stick with a smaller 24"" Vizio that I carry out to the patio, and power it with the TV's USB connector.All of the FireTV Sticks have the ability to talk to Alexa by pressing the microphone button.  Because they are directly linked to the FireTV stick, you can also tell it to search for and pull up apps.  Before using the FireTV products, I was accustomed to selecting a search box and keying in what I was looking for.  With the FireTV Sticks, I can press the mic button and say what app I'm looking for and install it.  Or, I can tell it what program I am looking for and it may search and find it on YouTube, then start playing it.  Neat feature and habit forming.  The voice remote has many other features, like being able to answer my Ring doorbells, view my CloudCams, and other Alexa related skills.  However, for most Alexa related activities, I usually have an Echo in the same room and use that, rather than the Fire Stick.How does the FireTV Stick Lite compare with the Roku Express?  Because they are similarly priced,  you'd expect them to be very similar, but they are actually quite different.  I've always liked Roku's and the Express is a very fast and capable unit.  It doesn't hang from the HDMI connector, but instead connects with a short cable and sits under or on top of the TV, positioned so the remote's IR beam can control it.  The Roku Express seems to respond faster, and with some apps, performs much faster.  Again, that could be and app thing, and not the performance of the unit.  With CEC compatible TVs, the Express is able to turn the TV power on and off with the basic remote.  One BIG difference (and one that's hard to find in the literature) is that the FireTV Stick works on Wi-Fi at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.  The Roku Express only works at 2.4GHz.  If your network is heavily dependent on 5GHz, the Roku Express won't be a good choice.  Fortunately, in my situation I am able to use both.Finally, with any smart TV adapter, make sure that you get one that will run the program apps that you want.  They are mostly the same on the Roku and Fire devices but there are differences.  For example, on the FireTV Stick, I can view my Amazon Photo library, including videos that I've shot with my cel phone.  I can't do that (at present) with the Roku.  You may find that the Roku has apps that are not available on the FireTV products.  Ultimately, it's the apps that make these things work.

  I admit that the thought of cutting off cable caused me actual emotion pain lol.  But so did paying that cable bill.  The Amazon firestick delivers everything I need for TV viewing.  I am not missing cable at all!  I am so happy that this technology is available and delivers television viewing in a remarkably easy and painless way at such an affordable cost.  Now... what to do with that $120 extra per month... :)  I'm a happy girl!

  We were previously using a game console to stream video content to our TV. This was fine for the gamers in the house (me) but everyone else struggled with using the controls to watch streaming programs. I picked up the Fire TV Stick Lite and was amazed and how easy it was to to setup. Installing apps for streaming was like you would do on a phone or tablet and the remote is simple to use. My daughter really likes the built in Alexa to the remote. With this we are getting much better use of our streaming services. We have even figured out how to get HBO Max on it so there is no need to go back to the game console for anything other than games.

  I have been a long time Fire Stick user since 2015.  I have 3 - and all of them are gen 1s.  Yes, the upgrade has been long overdue.  And wow, gen 3 is incredibly fast.Some thoughts and tips:1) The out of the box experience was very smooth.  If you are familiar with Fire Stick of any generation, then everything will be very familiar to you.  It checked for new software update which took a few minutes, but I was up and running in no time.2) (Coming from gen 1), the remote feels more ""premium"".  The buttons are rubber on gen 3, as opposed to hard plastic on gen 1.3) I bought the ""lite"" because a) I don't have a 4K TV (and therefore no need for a Fire Stick 4K) and b) didn't really care for the additional features of ""standard"" compared to ""lite'.  As far as I can tell, there are only 2 differences: 1 TV controls (on/off and volume) and 2. Dolby Atmos.  Neither of these mattered to me.4) If your wifi connection is dodgy, do yourself a big favor and get an ethernet connector.  It tremendously improves the experience.  In this regard, you don't have to buy the Amazon branded one.  Search for ""KOOPAO Micro USB to RJ45 Ethernet Adapter"" on Amazon and save yourself $5.This is so worth the upgrade - especially those who are still running gen 1.

  This is the first product I've reviewed on Amazon.  I had a first-generation Fire TV Stick that lasted 5 years, but my wife lost the remote when we moved.  I bought this because I don't have a 4K TV, so I didn't need the nicest version.  It is a complete piece of crap.  With the first one I received, Netflix worked well, but other apps (Hulu, ESPN, FOX Sports, HGTVGO, etc.) experienced issues.  I thought I got a lemon, so I requested a replacement.  The second one had the same problems.  Amazon must have spent no time developing or troubleshooting this device.  I'm super disappointed and annoyed.

  11.13.2020 - I have Apple TV, Roku, and Roku Stick in my home and have used them for years. I decided to give the Fire Stick Lite a try because (1) it was compact, (2) it would connect with a speaker setup I have with two Echo Dots and an Echo Subwoofer, and (3) I love Amazon's products.Setting it up wasn't too difficult, but I can't always get the sound actually to come through my Echo Dots. Sometimes it will do it automatically; other times it won't. When the sound doesn't come through the Echo speakers, it also doesn't come through my TV itself. And no matter what I tell Alexa, it won't get the sound going. I need to restart or unplug the device to get it to work.When the sound does work through my Echo speakers, the volume is quite low -- even when it is turned up all the way. Now, I am not expecting home-theater quality, but I would expect them to be at least as loud as they are when I listen to music on Amazon Music Unlimited, which is completely sufficient. Just to make sure it wasn't my imagination, I measured the sound using the Main Title on the Star Wars Episode IV soundtrack on Amazon Music and the Main Title on the movie itself on Prime Video; the Prime Video is ten decibels lower than the Amazon Music. When the sound is relatively loud on a program, it's not a problem, but when it is somewhat quiet, any ambient noise in the room can easily drown it out. (This may be more of a limitation with the Echo Dots than with the Fire Stick, but it is something I thought I'd note for those who need the volume louder.)I've only had it for two weeks now, and I've used it maybe five days so far. Two times, after watching for about an hour, suddenly there was white noise coming from the Echo Dots and the subwoofer. I backed out and opened the app again but then there was no sound at all. I restarted the device, and still no sound. I unplugged it and plugged it back in, and this seemed to fix it. The second time this happened, I went through the same steps, but unplugging it didn't work this time.Twice so far the video has completely frozen, forcing me to unplug the device and restart it.It also seems to have some WiFi connectivity issues or at least some communication issues. For example, I attempted to open one app, but the device said it couldn't open it because it is not connected to WiFi. So I checked the settings, and it said that I AM connected to WiFi with a ""very strong signal."" I go back to the app again, and it says I'm not connected to WiFi. I try a different app, and it opens right up.The verbal commands also don't seem to work all the time. When I say, ""Open Disney+,""  Alexa wants to open something else Disney-related. So I say, ""Open Disney+ on Fire TV,"" and Alexa replies, ""You have How Many Days enabled. Do you want to open it?"" OK? I have found that I have a better chance if I switch the sentence around and say, ""On Fire TV open Disney +.""  Still, only one out of five times when I say this does it actually work. The other four times, Alexa responds with, ""I couldn't find Disney."" It's really frustrating.One other small issue I have is the ""enter"" button on the remote. When I press it, it feels and sounds like it has cellophane stuck underneath it. Not a show-stopper, but a little annoying.It seems to be a very temperamental device, and I am very disappointed. I am going to work with it some more and see if some of these bugs just go away. I'll update this review, if they do.UPDATE 12.02.2020 - Upon submitting my review, I immediately was contacted by Amazon's tech support inviting me to get in touch with them to resolve the issues I was having. When I had time, I arranged for a call with them. The first individual with whom I spoke for about 30 minutes went over some very basic things -- most of which I had already tried. She transferred me to another tech rep, who was more knowledgeable about the system.After trying a few things with no success, the second rep suggested that I should do a complete reset of the device. He said he could call me back at a designated time to follow up and make sure things were working correctly. I asked if he could call back in two hours. He called back about three hours later, which was fine, but the device was still downloading information, so we couldn't test it. He suggested that I give it 12 full hours and then give it a try.I waited until the next day, which was well over 12 hours, and the device said it was still downloading - although the progress bar was completely full (as it was the previous evening). I took a chance figuring that maybe the downloads had completed and set up my Fire Stick anew. Everything seemed to be working alright, so I then connected it to my Echo speakers (two Echo Dots and an Echo subwoofer). It worked well for a while but then it ended up doing the same white noise for about a minute and then cut off the sound completely. I disabled the Echo speakers, and the Fire Stick worked fine again. I have not reconnected my Echo speakers to it and just used the TV's sound instead. I have used it for several days, and I have had no further problems.So, long story short, it seems that the issue is somehow caused by connecting it with my Echo speakers, which is unfortunate, as this is the whole reason I decided to go with a Fire Stick rather than a Roku. If I had it to do over, I would definitely have gone with a Roku device, as it has access to apps that the Fire Stick doesn't - such as VUDU.Still, the device works okay on its own, so I am upgrading my review to two stars.

  I am writing this from the perpective of a device addition or upgrade from a pervious Firestick owner. I ordered this because technology keep improving and Amazon does use fast processors as they become less expensive. They also increased the WiFi speed and memory over the old version that I have, and you can really feel the difference. So, from an improved hardware perspective I am happy.Unfortunately, this time they are trying to upgrade the interface again... and planning to port it to my older Fire TV devices. The new interface is clunky like the old one, just in a different way. Each time the device wakes up, it asks which profile you want to use. This might be okay if you rarely leave your device for the few minutes that it requires to go to sleep, but it often affects me. The other issue with the profiles feature is that it rarely does not do much. It does not automatically select your profiles in your apps... it seems to only work for Amazon Prime, which I watch but not as much as Hulu, Netflix and other apps. This profile feature is only a part of the user interface changes. There is now no means to scroll through more than your first five apps... and there is no longer a recent app menu which was very convenient if you use some apps more than others. Often the remote shortcuts fail to function, as the  OS seems to have a new bug where it ignores your button presses when it is low on memory or busy... sometimes making you think your remote batteries have drained. Also, low memory seems to make Hulu loop back to the beginning after playing for a bit...Another unfortunate concern is that they have not resolved the existing issues with functionality, The first is that when you leave an app, either by choice or by the amazingly short timeout happening, the app still continues to run in the background using up memory. This is neither easily resolvable manually, nor do they do it automatically in the background. This is the reason that the devices run out of memory! The second issue is that when you leave the device for a bit and come back to a blank screen, it does not resume where you left it... you still need to go and reopen your app and select your app's user profile... and now you get the extra step of choosing your Amazon profile before all of this.I am hopeful that they can and will resolve these issues if enough users complain, but the mainstream website reviewers seem to never notice nor mention issues with the products. I have opened issues with Amazon about other Amazon products and I have not seen any changes... so if you want these fixed, you need to write them in your reviews and contact them.The voice recognition is still the same, just as spotty as always. Alexa integration is also unchanged. Stream quality in apps is still extremely clear on a 1080p TV.Overall, the device is fast and if you are streaming TV without any pauses, it is a good deal. For me though, it seems to be getting worse with each new iteration... because like most modern people, I like to pause my TV when life happens. Amazon should be making this easier not harder -- they should fix issues before adding more issues.  Until these are fixed, I would recommend going with the other mainstream brand... as it does not have any of these issues. I am giving this device three stars (rounded from 2.5stars) average as it deserves five stars for the hardware and two stars for the new software bugs and still existing software glitches.

  Love it! However I have issues with it. Apps do crash from time to time, it goes into sleep mode too quickly when paused (probably need to find where to adjust that in the settings or something), and I don’t like not having the most recent whatever showing up on the home page (only Amazon content will show there, maybe another setting? Doubtful). Aside from these minor complaints, it works great! I have Hulu, Netflix, Disney, Prime (of course), and Apple TV accounts. They all work great. Very happy...but....I probably stared at the specs for the lite and regular one for no less than four hours before making the purchase. I knew everything was the same, but the difference between the two is clear: the lite requires you to use two separate remotes for volume and power for the TV, and is it worth $10 to have all that on the very sleek nice Firestick remote. Here is a break down of me living out my decision of trying out the lite:Day 1. I’m not that picky. I can have two remotes. Plus it’s in my home office, not a big room. No big deal.Day 2. Yep, I did lay the firestick remote by the tv and somehow left the other remote on the coach on the other side of the room. It’s just habit. I need to get used to putting them in the same place.Day 3. Why is this so hard to remember. This old remote for my TV doesn’t work very well. Maybe I should have went with the one with everything I need in one remote. It could have solved two problems, because of the aging TV remote. Hmmm.Day 4. Maybe I can duct tape the remotes together. There has to be some way to make this less painful. I’m really starting to regret this decision.Day 5. I’m not sure about any of the decisions I have ever made in my life if this is the type of decisions I am making. I have kids that were planned, maybe I’ve made all kinds of bad decisions that I have just been forcing myself to live with! How could I have not realized how much of a pain it is to keep these two remotes together. Why is that so hard, but now every time I have to hunt for one or the other it is like someone is punching me in the face with a $10 bill pasted to their knuckles. It’s the volume changing from all the office calls (or pausing or needing to do both or one of the other quickly) and sometimes it’s the boss so I can’t be running around the room trying to kill the sound before answering the call. This was a mistake, and I can solve it for $10. I’d pay $20 if I can escape the pain and suffering I have caused myself these five days which feels like five years!Day 6. Return initiated, extra $10 engaged, regular Firestick arrives tomorrow. It can’t get here fast enough! Now I’m cool with not having 4K because the only TVs I would use this on aren’t 4K and the one tv that is had its own apps (its smart like that, and it got a 1300 on the GRE, which is respectable). Let’s just breath and relax with the epiphany of one remote to rule them all, one remote to find them, one remote to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.Day 7. The one remote has become precious to me.So pay the $10. What do you need, ulcers?

  Apart from the price savings, there isn't much to like about the Fire TV Stick Lite.I have a full fledged Fire TV 4k stick, as well as a Chromecast.I bought this Lite version as a sort of spare for screen mirroring (sometimes the screen mirroring function on the Chromecast can be persnickety).I thought the only features the Lite Stick would lack would be volume/power and as I am fine using two remotes, I thought, why not?Here's why -- the Fire TV Stick 4K with onboard on and off seems to ""remember"" which HDMI port it was connected to and to maintain the audio/video connection.Whereas the Lite Version ""forgets."" I often have to turn the TV on or off, or reboot the stick. It's a nuisance.To be honestly, I use both of my Fire TV sticks mostly for mirroring, rather than the onboard Fire TV interface, which I find isn't nearly as responsible and intuitive as using the Amazon Prime Video app on my phone or PC, then mirroring that app to the Fire TV stick.Also, I noticed there were more ads on the Fire TV Stick than there used to be. Yes, I know Prime has ads for paid video content, but since when do we see ads for completely unrelated products like insurance policies?  Very obnoxious.Anyhow, in terms of being able to maintain a mirrored connection, both Fire TV sticks are better at it than my Chromecast, which connects more easily, but occasionally has to be reconnected when the connection drops.However, the Fire TV sticks are much more troublesome in terms of establishing the initial screencast link. For starters, there isn't a shortcut. You have to use the remote to maneuver to the settings menu, select display, select screen mirroring or screen sharing, and then select screen mirroring or sharing on your phone.Really, the  best way by far to use Prime Video is via a hard-wired cable connection from your pc/ipad/iphone/android, if you have the appropriate cable and provided the device you are linking supports MHL video output (which fewer and fewer Android devices support these days).All that said, if wireless casting is your only option and if you absolutely need a solution that is ultra-cheap when it is on sale, the Fire TV Stick Lite does work, provided you have the patience to reconnect it and perhaps reboot it once in a while.Nevertheless, if you can spare a few bucks more, I recommend buying the fully-fledged Fire Stick 4k rather than the lite version.

  First off, I want to point out how much I love the UI of Firestick. I have owned Apple TVs, Rokus, and Firesticks and for me, the Firesticks are far and away the best experience. They have the most apps, the most enjoyable UI, the easiest navigation, etc. (Plus they are customizable)Not only that, but they integrate with Alexa, so you're able to ask Alexa to play something and she will! I have it programmed into my Routines on Alexa to ""Shut off Shannon's Fire TV"" when I tell her goodnight! The remote is sturdy and has been dropped a number of times and still works like a charm. I would like the back battery cover to be able to stay in place a little better, but all in all, nice piece of machine!If you are trying to decide between a firestick, Roku, or Apple TV GET A FIRESTICK!If this review helped you - please leave a thumbs-up!(I was not paid or incentivized in any way to give this review. I purchased this product with my own hard-earned money!)

  I bought this to replace an old Roku that was giving me trouble, thought this would be an upgrade. Unfortunately, this is way more of a pain than the Roku has ever been. It almost never wants to play sound, which is incredibly irritating. I have to unplug it and plug it back in constantly, though that doesn’t even work most of the time unless I leave it unplugged for several hours or even days. It’s also a big pain to go back to a show you were watching. You have to click through all the channels, find the show, then try to figure out which one you were watching. It looks like you’ve already watched shows you didn’t see, the line across the bottom shows up on ones you never watched. If you were watching a series, most of the time it will jump several shows ahead so you have to go back and fast fwd through a bunch of episodes to figure out where you were. Sometimes it will randomly start playing in the middle of an episode you haven’t watched when you turn it on. I bought Discovery+ through this and can’t access it through my Roku, so it’s annoying when I want to finish a show but can’t get any sound. With everything technology is capable of these days, it’s amazing that not even the most basic things (like sound) will work. Too late to return it. Glad I at least bought it on sale since it’ll likely end up in the garbage. For now I’m back to using the old Roku as even that works way better than this thing. Extremely disappointing! I will just buy another Roku in the future. The idea and ability to get many different channels is great, if they could only get it to work consistently and fix some of the annoyances. Not worth having to keep unplugging it and plugging it back in several times just to hear the sound. Today I’ve done that 6 times and it still won’t work. At least my Roku plays sound.

  This is my first streaming Stick, I've previously used Roku stand alone devices. I did not need TV on/off or volume control etc so I went with the Lite. The main reasons for buying the Stick are: to evaluate the Fire user interface and try the Silk browser (Roku does not support a browser).The Stick was connected at the back of my AV receiver (using the supplied extension cord) within an AV cabinet, a less than ideal situation. Despite the Stick being surrounded by a jumble of receiver wires, that you might expect to effect RF signal strength, the remote worked fine and I obtained a Very Good WiFi signal indication.Stick setup was easy. The Fire homepage is arranged differently to Roku but is no less usable. The only omission is a complete lack of time & date info on the homepage or screensaver, something I'm used to with the Roku. The speed of operation is similar to Roku.The Silk browser works great. I use it to navigate to radio station homepages and bookmark the URL. While on the subject of radio stations, the Fire TV TuneIn app is not as comprehensive as either the Roku or Kindle tablet versions, with a lack of Recents and Favorites. However, the Fire TV iHeart Radio app is better than the Roku or Kindle tablet (go figure?) versions but it still lacks several local major stations. So between using Silk and iHeart I'm able get all the stations I need.The ESPN app took two attempts to load (load, fail-to-start, uninstall, re-load) but eventually worked fine. So far I'm impressed with the hardware and I've managed to overcome any software imitations.

  After evaluating several streaming devices, I’ve determined the Firestick is my best option with the most features and performance for a reasonable price. Especially with this new 2020 release, it performs faster and with fewer glitches than previous gens. I recently focused on the TiVo Stream 4K because I liked the way their search engine would aggregate content from all streaming sources, so you wouldn’t have to search individually through Netflix, Hulu, Apple+, Amazon Prime, etc. to try to find a movie.But guess what? Amazon has incorporated a new search that will do the same thing with this new release! If you notice, TiVo is so nervous about this they quickly dropped the price on their Stream 4K from $49 down to $39.....for BROKEN hardware. Read on.The main focus of my testing is surround sound capabilities. I use an OTG (On The Go) micro USB cable to plug in my thumb drives to the Firestick. I am then able to play my 5.1 audio files encoded as Dolby Digital AC3, DTS, FLAC, WAV, SACD-DST etc. Firestick DOES PLAY and properly decode all of these via the terrific “Kodi” player app. TiVo’s Stream 4K also plays these files, but even though it DISPLAYS a 5.1 Dolby Digital+ decode it is REALLY only playing in just TWO CHANNELS! Even a standard stereo two channel mp3 shows being played back as full Dolby Digital+ 5.1....FAIL!But the problem with the Amazon Firestick is its inability to read anything other than FAT32 formatted drives natively. EVERY other streaming device I’ve tested can read NTFS drives natively. Yes, there is a workaround by playing files through the “ES File Explorer” app that then plays through Kodi, but you can’t sequence playlists, and for each file you need to hit the home button to get back to the ES app to then load another file....NO GOOD!The other big issue with FAT32: files are limited to 4.2 gigs in size. FAT32 cannot read anything larger. So if you have a movie larger than 4.2GB you’re out of luck. So outdated.Amazon crew members, get on the “Stick” and add native NTFS support!

  I bought this to replace an old, 1st gen fire stick. It's only used on a small unsmart tv in our bedroom so I didn't need all the extra tv controls or 4k. The 1st gen has just gotten too slow and unreliable as it has aged, even after resetting it, so when the ""birthday sale"" came along I stepped up. WOW! What a difference in speed! I also have a 4k stick for the main living room tv and this actually seems a little quicker than it. Setup was easy, though you do have to be patient while it first downloads and updates during the setup process. There were a couple of times I thought it gave up, only to have it suddenly continue on. Anyone that's still using an old 1st gen I strongly suggest upgrading. You won't be sorry!

  Now have three fire sticks set up in our house. For the most part set up is quite easy. Stations come in clear. Don't use the Alexa feature. Still don;'t trust that technology. Internet hook up though is slow. Transitioning between cable and fire stick is not real smooth. Biggest criticism is setting up internet viewing locations in a convenient way to access. Have worked at this, and can't find a way to set up the stations I want. Also downloading Apps is problematical. At times just not making the connections. Will work at these items over time and hopefully figure out how set up. For now use the fire stick for a couple of internet stations, otherwise still using cable. That should change soon. Still not confident enough to cut the cord with fire stick, but getting closer.

  (Clarified on 2/15/21 due to the 4 emails I received from Amazon, Notifications on my Alexa, and CALL I RECEIVED AT WORK FROM SOMEONE AT AMAZON Cus Care - I am grateful but it says to me you already are aware of this product)No one explained to me in the store (Purchased at Staples where it was marked down to 21.50 as the prices are fixed to mirror Amazon.com) so that this could not actually control the volume of the monitor in my bedroom, only that it did not have advanced connectivity for sound and only HDMI (I am not sure if this device is any different at all, or it just comes with a less feature filled remote.) -- which I thought would be fine as that is all the Gen2 Firestick that I had did.  I needed a secondary device to my AppleTV and I thought that this would be worth the money. It is worth the 21$ to just add a tv easily BUT THERE IS NO INTEGRATION AT ALL, so it is a bit of a disappointment. This model is a bit underwhelming overall. Wish I had spent the extra 10$ on a standard fire stick so I could lower and raise the HDMI volume without having to get out of bed as this monitor has no remote.PS. Dear Amazon, WHY WOULD YOU THINK 6 months of ""food TV"" videos free, is a selling point. Get it together Amazon. This is like a bargain basement product, and you sold It like one. I already have Prime and Cable, and I dont cook so that is useless to me as I would imagine it is to 98% of the other users, which I HOPE you are paying for per activation, not some huge volume license, as again, WHO WOULD EVEN WATCH IT!

  I bought this to have Spectrum streaming service since Spectrum does not support Amazon Fire TV. So I end up with both Amazon Fire and Roku.While Fire TV device responses instantly, I cannot switch from Fire TV to Roku. I have to reboot every time and wait at least 2-3 min to have a response to the remote controller. It has been a month but I had to replace the remote controller battery 3 times! It is a very slow device with a bad remote controller design with useless buttons. For example, you do not need Netflix, Hulu, Vue, Sling buttons. Home page sofware keys should be more than enough. The 'return' button (round arrow key) does not have any function. It drains batteries like a coarse sieve while being not in use.I do not understand how they do possibly market this thing! Sad since I cannot find minus five star rating.

  I gave this stick 4 stars on the basis of it working with 4K.  My Vizio 65"" screen had to small of a indentation where HDMI1 was located for the Roku to fit, so I was temporarily forced to use a side port HDMI4, which only supports HDCP1.4.  No matter how hard I tried, or what I set the Roku to for display (tried auto, 720 and 1080) it would bring up everything fine, menus, channels, etc....until it tried play video, in which case, it would purple screen with an HDCP error and emit a loud tone from the TV requiring reboot.  This was tried several times, in various ways.  Never could get it to work.  Once I received my 1.5"" 4K compatable HDMI extension cable, and plugged the Roku into the 4K HDCP2.2 port, then it finally worked after about two attempts with a purple screen.  If you are looking for 4K, and have the time to spend tinkering and trying different things, then you may like this.  If you have no interest in 4K, or do not have a 4K TV, avoid this one.Added: 7/2018 - After buying a Marantz 4K HDCP2.2 AVR and plugging this into it, along with a 4K Tivo Bolt, everything worked fine and it streamed 4K video from the internet just fine.  I attempted to stream a 4K Atmos file from my computer server (i7 with Gig ethernet), and the flle would play about 2 minutes and then fail with an bandwidth error.  The file was 12Mb/s video, plus audio.  Tried 5GHz and 2.4GHz with same results using the Plex App.  Switched to the Tivo, which also has  the Plex app, but is hooked up through ethernet, and the file played fine.  So apparently, the wireless speed of this device isnt quite up to streaming 4K blu ray quality video (the signal was excellent and the Roku was 2 ft from the router).  If I had to do it over, I think I would pay the extra and get the external non-stick HD version, with ethernet connectivity.  All in all though, Roku is still the best platform for streaming I have experienced.Update: Unit was only used one or two hours, a couple times a month.  Lasted until today, and will now not accept remote control commands from original or new remote.  Hitting the trash bin.  Save your money and get the better version with a fan.  This one overheats badly.

  Recently we decided to cut the cord and as long-time Roku users we discovered that our old Roku would not be capable of doing the live streaming we would need to access services like Hulu Live or DirecTV Now.  After doing some research and based on Amazon customer and outside reviews we decided to upgrade to the Roku Streaming Stick+.  After a rocky installation process that took a couple of days we finally got it to work.  It was faster than our old Roku and the picture quality was superior.  Unfortunately, this did not last long.  Like many other reviewers, after about two months (a month past the return window date), we began to have issues.  At first we began to experience constant buffering every time we tried to watch a program.  And eventually we could not get the programming to start at all and got messages about our connection to the internet and about ""weak signal strength.""And of course whatever the trouble was it always came back to assigning the blame to OUR router, OUR SmartTV, and/or OUR internet provider.  We tried everything we could think of including restarting everything, reinstalling everything, and checking the status of our router and our signal (according to the Roku itself, our wifi and internet signals were good to excellent).  We went through this over and over again to no avail.  One of Roku's recommendations was to mitigate the interference between our router and the Roku stick by having them in close proximity to each other with no walls in between.  While our router and Roku were not in the same room, they were in sight of each other.  And if that were the problem, why did this arrangement work fine with our old Roku and with this one for the first two months?  On the other hand, one of the selling points of the Stick+ was that it would work with a less-than-ideal signal.Finally, after several days of trying and failing to get access to any programming using the stick, we put the unit back in the box and reinstalled our old Roku (which worked just fine).Some avenues of exploration that Roku might consider concern the Stick itself.  Our old Roku box is relatively cool to the touch.  On the other hand, when the Stick's power cord is plugged into the wall the unit gets extremely hot (even when it is not plugged into the TV).  Also, on our Samsung SmartTV the HDMI socket is relatively high on the back of the set and even though the Stick ""clicked"" into place the downward stress with the added weight of the USB power cable pulling on it might have had the effect of weakening the connection.  The old expression ""it hangs like a dog's ear"" comes to mind.  At one point I even used tape to affix the cables to the back of the TV in an effort to relieve the stress, but like everything else we tried it only worked briefly.  As a last resort we requested the free HDMI extender cable that Roku offers in case the Stick+ does not fit your HDMI socket and it did strengthen the connection, but it did not solve the overall problem.  We still kept getting messages about signal strength and we still could not successfully access programming.  It's as though we had come full circle from the early days of TV when someone in the family had to hold the rabbit ears to get a clear signal.  Nowadays you need a volunteer from the audience to hold the Stick in place while wearing an oven mitt.Maybe there just some inherent problems with the Stick+.  Six hundred negative reviews (as of this review) should not be ignored.

  In 2015 I ordered a Roku streaming stick. It worked fine for a while, but after a year, it quit working. In the meantime, I had purchased a newer tv and was able to access Amazon Prime and Netflix directly through the TV, so I never pursued repairing or replacing the Roku. I was never charged anything for my Roku other than the initial purchase price.I recently acquired Disney +, which I can access directly on my living room tv, but wanted to access it on my granddaughters older tv. I ordered a newer Roku streaming stick to install on her tv. In the process of installing it, I was told to call Customer Service to get technical assistance for my installation. When I called Customer Service they told me that the original Roku was still linked to my account and could not be unlinked. Because this was the second Roku on my account, I would be charged $129.00 for a 5 year basic account. I don't know what a basic account includes, but he said I would not be able to access Disney+ with the basic account. I didn't ask what the other options were, because the $129 was already more than I was willing to pay for an account that I had never been charged for in the past 5 years. I could probably buy her a newer tv and access the Disney+ and it wouldn't cost much more than the Roku.

  Love my Roku!! But I almost sent it back shortly after trying to install it. When I went to the Roku website to connect and put in the code to activate, the first link says ‘link and connect easy com link activation’.  Because it was a Roku link or so I thought, I called the number. They were going to charge me $69.99 to connect. Then I found the “real” Roku link down on the list and activated my account. The scammers argued with me, got nasty, hung up on my when I refused them the fee. They said we will activate it for 10 minutes and give you a chance to think it over. Somehow they were able to do this. PLEASE BEWARE!! They are scammers and probably identity thieves. The Roku was easy to install and has worked perfectly. I would definitely purchase another for the other tv.

  Update 1/13/2020:So, it's been close to 5 months since I received the replacement. It's been working almost issue free (a few hard restarts here and there). I've updated my rating to 3 stars (from 1 star) just for Roku's horrible customer service and I feel longevity is still unclear.I wouldn't buy it again unless it's $15 or less and wouldn't recommend buying it for its current price.Original review 8/2019:This is my 5th Roku. I also have 2 fire sticks but Roku always seems faster and the UI is more intuitive.The Roku Streaming Stick+ is my favorite so far (when it comes to responsiveness) and it was working flawlessly for over 2 months before I started having remote connection issues and a few days later wifi connectivity issues.Roku customer service is horrendous.I've spent over an hour (after 30 minutes wait) chatting with CS representative. He kept saying to call my ISP to resolve the wifi issues even though it was working flawlessly before and that this is the only device in my house that has connection issues. It took him forever to respond and he kept asking the same questions basically ignoring my answers.Only after I told him this chat was going nowhere he offered a replacement.I had to pay to ship it back to Roku. I received the replacement 14 days after they received the defective one, no communication from them whatsoever.Calling them is just a waste of time. No matter what options you make, you never get to speak with anyone and it will end in an abrupt hang up.I wouldn't get again or recommend getting any Roku with a ""point anywhere"" remote. I have 5 Roku devices, 2 of them with ""point anywhere"" remote and both remotes stopped working.Roku really do make great media devices and I was always happy with their products but if you do have a problem, you will need to deal with their very unhelpful customer service or simply trash your Roku if warranty has expired.Also 90 day warranty is not enough.I can't give a 5-star rating to a product that is not 100% backed by its manufacturer.I think it's just a matter of time before the replacement will break too.

  I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick+ for two reasons:1. To attach it to my TV that is not a smart TV.  Without built-in streaming apps or W-Fi capability, my TV needed a streaming device to view alternate programming.2.  To replace an Infinity cable box that I've been paying a monthly rental fee to use.I read the descriptions and customer reviews of multiple Roku devices to find one that might meet my goals at a reasonable price.  This device really fits the bill.  I ran it through testing before disconnecting the cable box.  I can still see all of the Xfinity channels in my package (I was skeptical about this).  I had to get used to a different menu and user interface, but most of the features are available including recording, searching, and voice commands.  One thing that is missing vs. the Xfinity remote is that the Roku remote does not have an Info button to see program descriptions.The picture quality is excellent.  Once a link is established the Roku remote can be used to power on the TV, but there is a slight delay in response time compared to the Xfinity remote or the TV's manufacturer's remote.If you select this model you should add a USB extension cable to your order:  You'll be glad that you did.  The USB extension cable provided in the box is too short unless your TV is within two feet of the wall socket.All in all, I recommend this product.  I will be sending in the Xfinity cable box to lower my monthly bill.

  Roku streaming stick plus is a great add-on to a non-smart TV. Very easy to set up even detected my TV in set up the remote code so I can turn the TV on and off with Roku remote the voice command on the remote works well it was able to look up the app says I ask for them but the only downside I can see is the stick is very long and uncertain TV's it looks like it might stick out the side or not fit into the area where you're supposed to plug in HDMI so you might wanna double check if you have the space for this stick.You need 3 3/8 ""clearance.This effectively replaced both my old Sony SMP-N200 streamer and my Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter for Miracast.Also ROKU has a Windows Phone App! Works great in my 950.The menu navigation is fast as is app launching (The quad-core really helps), I also this weekend brought the Sharp - 43"" Class (42.5"" Diag.) - LED - 2160p - Smart - 4K Ultra HD TV Roku TV SKU: 5746801 at BB that also has Roku TV built in.  Both support Miracast which means I can easily hook up my Surface Pro's in out family.The assigned one-touch app buttons: Netflix, Sling, hulu, PSVueAt $48 on BF  this is awesome.

  I have to say that I am disappointed in this purchase.  I did fairly extensive research before deciding to buy the Roku Streaming Stick+, comparing it to Apple TV, Playstation Vue, Amazon Fire and others.  I even read the Roku website and blog that says the following:BackgroundJust like your smartphone has an “app store” for installing new applications, you can access the Roku Channel Store on your Roku streaming player or Roku TV™ to add new “channels”. Channels are applications for your television, popular channels include Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, VUDU and HBO GO. Additionally, current generation Roku devices include access to The Roku Channel, which features hit movies and TV at no cost to you.Do I have to pay for channels?Although some channels must be purchased or require a paid subscription, many others allow you to watch movies and TV shows for free.Which channels allow me to watch movies and TV shows?There are many channels that offer movies and TV shows including popular choices like Netflix, Google Play, Vudu, FandangoNOW and Hulu.Search Movies & TV shows in the Roku Channel Store.Are there channels that allow me to watch live or local TV?Yes, there are live broadcast channels like ABC, NBC, CBS, HGTV and Fox. In addition, some cable/satellite companies are creating Roku streaming channels that allow you to access all or most of the channels you get through your cable subscription without having a separate cable box (e.g. Spectrum TV, Comcast Xfinity, DIRECTV NOW).If you have Roku TV, you can also connect an antenna to access live and local broadcast TV over the air.I got the distinct impression that I'd be able to watch my live and local broadcast TV via the Roku system.  Wrong.  Turns out that the Roku stick does not have an antenna slot, and the Roku channels provide ""live"" news that is actually not live.  It's an amalgam of news recorded throughout the day and then recycled throughout the day on various channels.  Further, when I tried to watch Saturday Night Live, I could only access archived Saturday Night Live episodes, or buy a separate subscription for the show.  Hey, I'm used to watching it live, for free, over my HDTV antenna.  So, I ended up switching back to my antenna.  The only way to actually get what was advertised is to not buy the Roku stick, but, rather, to buy a Roku TV with an antenna slot that allows live and local broadcast TV to be processed via the Roku TV system, including pause and replay.  Ya gotta read the fine-print!The only reason I'm still giving Roku 2 stars is because, in its own right, with all the caveats I've mentioned, it's not too bad.  I'm hoping I can get used to having both the Roku stick and the HDTV antenna to serve my needs.Update May 27, 2018:  my Roku stick stopped working.  Not sure what happened.  Power surge?  Really don't know.  But, after calling customer support and going through the usual ""Is it plugged in?... Have you tried a different outlet?..."" they finally gave me a return authorization, so now I'm waiting for a replacement.  Sheesh.

  We bought this to replace an old streaming stick with a different kind of remote (I think the old one was radio and this is infrared but I'm not a techie). The old one had so many issues with the remote not being recognized, something to do with wifi interference or something. It was so frustrating we hardly ever used it. I finally went ahead and got this since it seemed to be different. And it is! No remote issues whatsoever, it seems to load and do everything faster. I did have to plug it into separate power since the usb output of the TV apparently didn't have enough power. But that's not too big of a deal. The voice recognition works amazingly well. My wife has a bit of an accent and it hasn't misinterpreted anything so far. Overall this is super nice!

  Really like the user interface of this Roku but it’s proved to be a real inconsistent pain in the arse every time I turn it on. Often times it’ll show that no device is plugged in. This requires that I unplug it and replug it in, often multiple times. Customer service has been ZERO help suggesting that I “try to use it on a different TV” as if I had a spare TV lying around my living room. This is a brand new LG OLED TV, so it’s not like I’m using a TV that’s a decade old. How about you, Roku, work on fixing your product rather than blaming it on someone else’s! Really disappointed for the money I spent on this thing.

  I've know for years that the Roku Stick was a superior product than the Amazon Stick but I already had an Amazon stick and figured how bad could it be?Well after frustratingly suffering through Amazon Stick for years, I had enough and purchase this Roku Stick. I should have done this month if not weeks after getting my Amazon Stick but I was too lazy and stubborn.I've only had it three days and it's never crashed. The Amazon Stick crashes or freezes on a daily basis.The Roku remote works perfectly and with my TV while the Amazon Stick remote never works, doesn't work with my TV, and their phone app remote is just as bad.The Roku wifi signal has never dropped while The Amazon Stick looses the wifi signal while it's sitting right next to the Router.This review will probably get deleted at some point for trashing an Amazon product but here you go.

  The concept is fine. The execution is horrid. It is all about the remote, not the stick. I found out, like others, that this remote design eats batteries about every 2 weeks depending on how much you use it. I finally put an ammeter on it and I found that the remote draws 30-150mA for about 45seconds after touching any button. If the remote is used on any reasonable frequency, that is far too much to be supplied by 2-AAA batteries.On the chance it was a defective remote, I got a replacement. Sorry, it is the design of the remote that is the problem. I will be returning the replacement also and getting a Roku with only an IR remote. It is really sad that Roku would hoist this ""long-range RF design"" without a warning. Most people expect 6-12 months life from remote batteries, not 2 weeks.

  The unit quit working after 6 months. Could not sync the remote to the stick. After troubleshooting with the tech by phone it was determined the unit was bad and an RMA warranty was issued.  The unit was returned by Express Mail and arrived within four days of the RMA being issued. Then a whole series of canned emails began, most ending with the question had this been resolved. I kept answer4ing no, not until a replacement unit was shipped. More canned emails. After about 10 days of this I was able to locate a customer service phone number (not on Roku’s website) and called them. I was told the status was they have the RMA, it takes about 10-14 days to ship a replacement depending on the warehouse but that I would b e getting a replacement soon. This seems to be ridiculous amount of time for a warranty replacement. A week later I get an email requesting a tracking number for the original return. Well I had been in temporary quarters for several weeks and had now  relocated and frankly did not store the USPS receipt safely as Roku said they had received the unit. Called Roku again and explained all of this to an agent who spoke poor English. Said he would do nothing without a tracking number. Asked to speak to someone who could resolve issue or to a supervisor. The agent just kept repeating without the tracking number he would do nothing and would not allow me to speak with anyone else. I finally gave up. I will now go with Amazon Fire-stick. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered in either my professional or consumer roles.

  Love it on my little Office TV. The TV is HD w HDMI port. But it is not a smart TV. I wanted to watch maybe my Prime or NF w/o commercials. I just cut the cord and tried a few antennas. But the $40 spent there was mostly a waste of $ on the little older TVs. I have no clue what is on the 20-40 channels I get in there. I only watch that TV after work during my treadmill or exer bike time. I’m thrilled w the pic quality. Plus I can watch so many old TV show if I want on many Roku channels w commercials. I immediately ordered a 2nd for my Bed/Liv smart TV. The Smart TV’s USB port is powerful enough to power the Roku. The office non-smart required the included USB extension and included wall plug. I ordered the HDMI extender that you can order from Roku for free. I don’t need it at home, but I plan to take it w me when I travel, because you don’t know what may be at your hotel, etc.  I like that the extender was offered for free w free 3 day shipping

  I bought this in 2/2018. Six months later the remote stopped working properly. I contacted customer support, and through troubleshooting, the problem was fixed. A while after the remote stopped working again. This time I was told to get an adapter to fix the problem, which did nothing. I contacted roku again today about this problem but because it’s been over a year they will no longer pay for a new remote. For paying $60, I am very disappointed with the quality and with the customer service. My device is no longer usable at this point and I refuse to pay for another remote when I did nothing to break it in the first place. Would not recommend this product to anyone.

  TLDR Buy an AppleTV.The first thing you notice after installing your new Roku is the large ad on the side of the screen – on the thing you paid for. It can not be turned off. I tried. Hard. Even if you never connect to a network, and the Roku won't do anything since there's no media player installed, the space will be used. You'll need to install a media player via yet another account on their website.So you go to the fugly website, disable some security so the login works, and jump through hoops to find something to sort of work. Oh look Netflix... hmm that doesn't look right... Sometimes the Roku can't hold a connection no matter what you do. Fine. Maybe tomorrow. I'll just shut it off... You can't. It keeps running 24/7. If you put in a USB stick or memory card adapter you'll discover it's constantly warm. The Roku never stops accessing it. What it's doing I have no idea, but it creeps me out.The Roku is pretty bad at everything it does. There's really very little the Roku can do that you can't do with a Raspberry Pi, if you're technically inclined. If it's too much trouble to do that, you can buy an AppleTV. Apple's heavy handed controls are only slightly less cumbersome than Android's privacy and security woes. Seriously, I've spent more time trying to get this thing to do what it's supposed to... that's why I'm on my machine today, again... at least the ads work...

  This is a great streaming device and the third Roku that I have so far (still using all 3 just fine) Let me start by first saying that there is a very popular highly trending negative rating from Nov 2018 here on Amazon warning people that if you try to add more than 2 Roku devices onto your account, Roku will insist on starting to charge you for a Premium account (or something.) This is false. The first photo I included here is my account showing all 3 of my Roku devices on my one account, zero charged, still free. So don't believe that review. The only thing i can think of is that maybe the author of the negative review got scammed and clicked on a spoofing/phishing website that tried to scam her out of money. Either way, rest easy, it's false, you don't get charged for having 3 devices and here's your proof. The second picture is my connection to the TV. I used the direct to TV method (powered by TV, not using electrical outlet.) You can see that the Roku itself is plugged in to the HDMI-3 port and the short black power wire is going into the USB port labeled ""USB (HDD 5V 1A)"" just above it. That's it. Easy-peasey. If you have a TV with connections that can support this set-up, it doesn't get much easier. It fired right up, linked right up to the Wi-Fi extender I already had right in the same room. Signal rating is ""excellent."" The third and final picture is the home screen after a few minutes of churning away adding/installing all the apps. All fired up and ready to go now. Very fast and robust navigation from app to app and using the apps. Way faster than my two older ones (Roku-3 from 2013, and Roku Express from 2017) I don't have a big body of work using the voice command remote. It's my first one, the older ones don't have that. I tried it once, I said something like ""Open Netflix app"" and it did just that, brought me right to the Netflix app and opened it. Pretty cool I guess. Granted it's only been a couple days but so far it's been great, as have the other two other Roku units in the house. Overall great deal. Very happy and would not hesitate to recommend it.

  Oct 10, 2020Like (what's better than the Amazon Fire stick):You can customize the home page (move things around)!You can remove apps you don't use!Freaking faster! It's not just faster...it's FASTER. Loads apps fast! Fast! FAST!My Samsung TV remote doesn't disconnect every other day because the Roku remote controls EVERYTHING.So far, it's only locked up once (thus the 4 stars) as the Fire stick needs to be rebooted (or power disconnected)  every other 5 days or so. (I have 5 Fire sticks and they all do that. My boss at work has a few also and he reports the same thing)What I don't like about it (compared to the Fire Stick):More expensive (about $20 more if the Fire Stick is on sale at $29).This review will be updated should anything change.

  Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote with TV ControlsI finally made the leap.I evaluated Fire and Roku.  (I looked at the original Chromecast who wants to need their phone to watch TV?)I chose Roku because it didn't have a goofy ""modern"" interface like the Fire (and Amazon Prime Video) does.The Roku is so easy to use!I bought my first one in July 2020.  This is my third one...for a third TV!It is so fast.  I used to torture myself trying to watch Netflix with the App built into the FIOS box.  The Roku is SOOOO much faster and easier to use and doesn't cost me $12 a month!  And Smart TVs?  Can they get any slower?  The Roku is so fast!The Roku is awesome!I haven't found any streaming channels that I can't watch using the Roku (YMMV).It even displays content from my phone.Good quality build.  Fast.  Easy to use.It's just a matter of time before I buy a 4th one!

  So overall this thing is great, easily portable, gets all the apps we couldn’t on our TVs BUT, I don’t know who decided the cord length but it’s not even close to long enough for most applications. If you have your tv wall mounted you’re probably going to need an extension cord. Major annoyance and downfall.

  I bought this 3 weeks ago my son finally installed it kids they take forever to do something lol so we had a very old roku box and it started acting up so I got this to replace it. We've always used roku but decided to go with the firestick. It was easy to set up and boy let me tell ya this thing is super fast compared to our old roku box. I had to tell my son to slow down so I could see what's on the screen lol he was jumping around to different screens and apps so fast. The picture quality is real good also and our tv is about 6 years old. I'm thinking about getting another one for my tv upstairs it's a roku tv and works great but it's not as fast as the firestick and doesn't have the voice activated remote which my son really likes with the firestick.

  My fire stick light didn't work it kept powering off I thought it was the remote or maybe the power wires that came with it so I hooked my other fire stick up to it the old one and it worked perfectly fine with the new power wires and remote so it was the fire stick itself I've tried calling Amazon but haven't got in touch with them to do a return and I have been too busy this month and with being hospitalized to put that return fire stick at the top of my priorities list.

  I have tried other Android TV Boxes.  None of them are compatible with Disney+.  They may say they are.. But they're not.I finally gave up and bought the Amazon Fire Stick Lite.  We bought it at a local store.  Not here on Amazon.  We were in a hurry and didn't want to wait for shipping.  However, Amazon asked for a review.  So here it is.We stream mostly Amazon Prime and Disney+. There are other 3rd party streaming sites, but we don't use them as much.  Like I said before, we have been using a ""generic"" Android TV box.  That one replaced a different one.  Neither were compatible with Disney+.  The newer one claimed it was.  NOT!!The Fire Stick is much easier to use than the other TV boxes.  There was no real set-up required.  Just plug it in, Log-in to Amazon & the other apps we're using, and go.  Easy peasy.We haven't tried the voice search yet.  But I'm sure we'll get around to it.  We don't have any Alexa devices in our home, so we don't use that feature.This Amazon Fire Stick came with an HDMI extender, and remote.Forget the knock-offs.  Get the Fire Stick.  You'll be glad you did.***Please note:  I Did Not receive any discount for my review.  This was purchased at the retail price.***

  I really wanted to like this, and in some ways I do. I got it for an older flat screen in my bedroom to make it a bit ""smarter"" and give me some more viewing options. But it has been a nightmare in many ways. First, the sound keeps dropping out. No sound at all on any viewing option or even the menu navigation sounds. Only reliable fix is to reboot the device - and it happens all the time. Amazon tech support couldn't really help me. It also has a cord which is far too short when you are trying to adjust to get a Wi-FI signal. I had to buy a longer one - about 3 feet vs 3 inches. It still didn't solve my problem. The signal fluctuates from good to marginal. Amazon tech support recommended a ""signal booster"" which wasn't a booster at all - it was just a longer cable. I did end up having to buy a real Wi-Fi booster - and it has a direct line of sight about 20 feet away from the Firestick. Now my signal strength fluctuates between very good and, wait for it - marginal. There is no option for hard wired ethernet built in - so now a have paid for a $25 piece of hardware, had to add extension cables, Wi-Fi boosters and now another add-on which will let me plug in an ethernet cable. Which I also have to buy and run under and through me house. $25 turned into $500. I could have got a real smart TV for a lot less. It doesn't have nearly enough storage - 8 GB? Really? In 2021? I can get 8 times that much on a thumb drive for under $10, or a 2 TB drive for around $50. It would have been so easy for them to make this product so much better right out of the box (for pennies more) and they didn't. Also, Amazon tech support told me adding wired ethernet won't help, but the Firestick on-screen messages when the signal drops off tells me it should help. (Too bad there is no ethernet port!) I pray that it does help, and that I don't have to reboot this thing every day for the rest of my life just to hear the sound.BTW, my real smart TV in the den receives the Wi-Fi signal from my router with excellent signal strength - and it passes through more wall than the Firestick signal did. The Wi-Fi booster I had to buy gets a strong signal. And the Firestick still keeps losing the signal even now when I have a direct line of sight with the booster. The Firestick itself is the problem.

  I bought the Fire Stick Lite to take advantage of a free year of Apple TV+. My 2018 Sony TV has all the other apps but Apple TV. The FS lite was easy to connect using the supplied HDMI extender cable and USB cable with power adapter. The Alexa  Voice remote lite came with AAA batteries. Installation was a breeze as the unit did almost all the work with my only input of a single password. The product description was accurate to what the remote does, just Alexa voice, select, home, back, menu, rewind, play/pause fast forward and guide buttons. I only use the FS lite for Apple TV; my Sony TV handles everything else. I have found the FS lite to be a bit quirky as it sometimes doesn't select what show I want, indicates I have already finished a series even though I have more episodes to view, and takes some time to start or continue a show when paused. I can either put it to sleep or let it sleep on its own when switching back to the Sony TV for other streaming services.20/12/31 update - still behaves strangely, sometimes restarts an episode after a pause. Software update allowed me to place Apple TV+ to front of menu choices. Noticed the recent price increase to $29.99 from $17.99 in just a month.

  I had ordered this to replace an old Fire Stick that I got back in 2016.  Decided that for the price point, I could upgrade.The Fire Stick I currently have is a replacement.  The initial one lost audio every time I tuned it on.  Then, it would not stream anything.  Since it had been less than a week since I got it, Amazon swapped it out for free.The one I currently have still has audio issues.  But, those issues are only after it starts up.  After doing a web search, I found a lot of others also complaining about this and suggesting to switch to another of the TV's inputs and back to the input with the Fire Stick.  So, I do that now and it solves that issue.The next issue is that the unit does not power on with the remote or phone app.  I have to unplug the power to the unit and plug it back in to wake it up.  I would connect the power to the TV, but I get a message that the TV's USB power may not be sufficient.  Never had that issue with the 2016 Fire Stick.The only upside to this Fire Stick vs the one from 2016 is that this one is much faster.  I'm hoping that Amazon will send out a patch that will fix the audio and power issues.  If they don't within the next few months, maybe it is time to look at other devices from other companies.

  I needed a way to access HBO Max, Discovery+ and a few other apps I couldn't get on my LG tv. This is great. It's easy to search with. I can ask Alexa to find a movie or series and it'll search all of my apps for what I'm looking for. Only negative.. the Amazon batteries that came with it for the remote didn't last a month. Seriously Amazon, your batteries won't last in a remote for a month. Even the crap batteries that come in any other tv or dvd player, last a couple years in a remote. This tells me I have always made the right decision in never buying amazon batteries. Otherwise the firestick itself works great. Application is great. Since switching everything to the firestick from my tv, the viewing over the internet has been 1000xs better. I no longer have to reboot my router, or reboot the connection on my tv daily. And having gotten rid of my satellite TV and using the internet for all our TV, this is a huge deal. So getting the firestick before getting rid of satellite was a must. Happy to say, it made a huge difference.

  My wife had enjoyed our original Roku unit for several years but had to start unplugging then plugging it in to get it to work. I looked online and thought I would ""upgrade"" to the Roku stick. It showed up promptly (thanks Amazon!) and the installation should have been a piece of cake. It wasn't. The software kept getting stuck on the installation. After power the unit and the tv down and up several times it finally went through. Now we're getting to the sad part.All remotes now a days have 4 directional navigation buttons and the right arrow on this unit wouldn't work unless you pushed REAL hard and repeatedly. Is it too much to ask for a new product to work like its supposed to? This new remote also has a cheaper, thinner non-ergonomic feel to it and is designed to be operated with your thumb. If you have to use your index finger, for instance, when lifting pointing the unit then one of your other fingers will always press the volume mute button. This is simply a bad design.When I use a service or product I think the provider should excel at what they do: a burger joint should make amazing burgers and stop chasing chicken n shrimp, a lamp should light when I press the button and a remote control should be intuitive, easy to hold and operate. Sorry Roku, you struck out on this one.

  I will begin by saying ROKU has the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  It is Saturday, I wanted to watch the NFL channel on my ROKU attached to the TV.  I downloaded the NFL app.  I followed the instructions.  I connected to my local TV provider but never once did I see ""the activation code box prompt"" so I could connect.  I have tried now at least four times.  Ironically, I have been able to turn the NFL onto my IPAD, IPHONE, and computer, but simply not ROKU.  Customer service has disconnected be twice, the phone line is impossible. and I have missed the game.  this is not the only time i have faced this frustration.  I have APPLE TV and an AMAZON fire stick but thought I would try Roku to compare.  Customer service is what makes or breaks a company.  Spending 60 minutes on a Saturday dealing with your unqualified service is wrong.  Your basically a gimmick for NETFLIX and AMAZON and in truth people should just get a smart tv.  But before you buy this device, pretend you own a ROKU and go to trouble shooting and see what happens.  Nothing.

  I've had Apple TVs from the first gen to the latest 4k one. For around $50 this Roku Streaming Stick+ is the best option for your money and this supports all current video and audio formats (4k, UHD, HDR, Dolby Atmos etc.). I added this to a Denon AVR-X4400H and it switches on the AVR and TV (Samsung UN65JU7500FXZA) and controls the volume as well. The only 1 remote I need and the only 1 streaming stick I use, although I have Apple TV 4th gen and Samsung Smart interface as well. This has way more apps and choices compared to Apple TV and the only thing this doesn't have is games (which I don't play it on Apple TV anyway).Another reason to get this in a bedroom or guest room is that you can access the Xfinity Stream app and all your subscriptions plus live TV through it rather than paying $10/month for a cable box to Comcast. That's ROI within 5 months. I have this in my main TV set in the living room and in the master bedroom. Also have a cheap TCL Roku TV in the guest bedroom. No issues activating unlike some reviews that mentioned it here while owning multiple Roku devices.Only cons I can think of -1) The voice recognition and search functionality needs major enhancement and doesn't work all that well.2) The remote acts up sometimes and doesn't control the TV/AVR and I have to reset the Roku device (others have mentioned this as well)Overall - I really want to give this 5 stars, 5 stars for the price, 5 stars for the app store, 5 stars for the functionality,  5 stars for formats supported, etc. etc. I'm just taking 1 star away for the minor niggles with remote and universal / voice search.

  This was my first Roku device. I was searching for a way to stream my Comcast to my outdoor backyard tv and this gets the job done.  There is some buffering that occurs but that is more of a function of my wifi environment.  The interface is easy to learn and use.  The HD/4k streaming is awesome. My only concern is that the stick gets really hot.  I've gotten a few on screen warnings. The TV is outside in a very open environment and it still gets really hot. This would not be a good device to put in some type of cabin. It works great but make sure you have great ventilation...even then it might be questionable. We'll see how long it last before it literally burns out.

  I'm going to go straight into pros and cons:PROS- Super Easy to install.- Voice recognition is very accurate.- Great design and I like the home screen.- Price is fair given alternatives.- Remote programmed on its own to my TV controls.CONS- The voice controls are just MEH! They don't really work within individual applications. For instance, you can't search for a certain show on Netflix while you are in Netflix. It will just search all applications for that show and then make you exit to the home screen in order to select it. It also doesn't automatically recognize whether you own the movie (say on VUDU) or not even when the account is linked.- Parental Controls are not available on the TV home screen or in settings. In fact they are VERY limited and the ONLY way to block purchases is to set up a pin on your Roku website account. I mean c'mon man, its hard enough as it is to keep my 3 year old from ordering accidentally, don't make it harder! *This is the prime reason for the 3-star rating (no pun intended).SUMMARYI am not impressed. I want to like it, but find myself just a little annoyed. Now that I have it all set up, I will most likely keep it, but who knows. I certainly like my friend's Firestick better. I'm only 1 person, but that's my $.02!

  Warning  this device power and sound control  does not work with Vizio M series tv. You pay an extra $20 for something you can't use so you might as well buy the $30 unit because ROKU doesn't tell you that ,you just have have to waste an extra $20 to find that out. Wonderful! Also , their support,LOL, emailed me back and 4 times to refer me to their website on  how to setup the remote when I described to them the trouble . Then they tell that my tv is not compatible with their device after playing email tag.In all the system does work on my other tv and I do like it but I don't appreciate being taken advantage.

  Honestly do yourself a favor and ditch all the other streaming sticks for this one!I’ve used an Amazon fire stick for years. I love Amazon and I’ve always thought their products were great- except for the fire stick.At first I thought it was my internet disconnecting and reconnecting constantly causing my apps to load slowly or just shut off. But when I would do stuff on my laptop/phone everything loaded perfect. (I had the latest stick too)Then I got the idea to just try to Roku and see if it’s any different.Well I’m here to tell you it’s well worth the switch. Roku’s program and layout is 100% better and faster. I’ve yet to have an issue (and being at home constantly right now-thanks COVID- I’ve had a lot of experience) and everything works just as I need it too.If I had to name a con- it would be that there isn’t a web browser like Amazon has. So that’s slightly inconvenient. Sorry Amazon- I’m still a loyal customer just with a Roku stick now.

  We have a Samsung HD 4K TV, but I bought this streaming stick to use primarily with a 10-year-old Samsung flat screen with 1080i / 720p resolution. It didn't work with the old TV: pink pixelated display with faintly visible menu. It worked perfectly with the HD 4K. So 5 stars for new HD TVs, 0 stars for older models.. If I were rating this just on support, I would give ROKU 1 star. The tech person I reached by phone didn't know what she was talking about. I gave her detailed specs for the old TV and she kept insisting that the HDMI port on my TV was defective even though I kept telling her that the port worked perfectly when I used it for other devices. I also submitted a ticket, which ROKU responded to several times, but only to say they were still looking into it. Finally, three or four days later, a response to the ticket, with an apology for the delay, recommended getting the ROKU EXPRESS PLUS. I did. The HDMI connection worked perfectly so I didn't need to use the RCA cable - the ""Plus"" - that was included in the package. So maybe the ROKU EXPRESS would have worked just as well.

  I love Roku. I get a ton of free channels and pay channels like Disney, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, music channels and more. Even international TV channels. I bought Roku sticks for my sons and can share log- ins on some streaming services so they have access too, cutting down on costs.  The Roku channel itself has tons of great shows and movies. So easy to set up and I'm saving over $100/month vs. cable TV.  Should have done this years ago. I got it for my 80 year old mother. It took her a bit to get used too, but now she's flying through the streaming services like a pro. She's delighted with the expanded options and huge cost savings vs her previous cable bill. She has so many program choices, she has spent an hour just looking at what her options are. Never again will she say ""I have all these channels, but there's nothing interesting to watch"" like she did with traditional cable. Great investment, and you can take it anywhere.

  When you go to activate it fails and tells you to call a phone number. They then tell you you can't activate unless you have a registration code which costs 99.00.It is a scam do not pay to activate, try to activate on a computer not a phone.

  I had one of the very early FireTVstick's (CV89LM). I was very happy with it, but the latest firmware/software upgrade slowed it down - a lot. I decided to try a new one (for under $20) and am VERY pleased with the purchase. It is much faster reacting to the remote and has some nice, new features. Alexa works great. Never had that, so it's fun to use. I will use the old one in my RV for occasional use, but love the new one at home. It's better than the Smart TV app on the television. You cannot beat it for the price. Especially if you have Amazon Prime for tons of free movie streaming. Get it.

  Wow! I never knew watching TV could be this easy. I don't have to jump out of one App to go to another thanks to the awesomeness that is the Firestick Lite. Having everything in one place is what I dreamed of but never thought would be a possibility. I can search for a movie or show easily. For example, In Plain Sight, and be shown which app has it (Imbd) instantly. I don't have to search every app individually any longer. Do you get what  blessing that is??? No more typing in the title 4 or 10 times. Just type it once and POOF its displayed, and with options to purchase it if so desired. Complete game changer here people! Less jumping from App to App means more time for binge watching. Who of us doesn't want more time to enjoy our shows?!If you have more than one TV, buy one for each!!! You won't experience the supreme let down of going from one truly awe inspiring viewing experience back to the mundane experience of having all your apps open and still not finding what you're looking for. I'm kicking myself in the butt for not ordering a 2nd one on Cyber Monday.I've seen the future and it is beyond what I ever dreamed it could be. Join me as a fellow firestick owner and you, too, can enjoy the fruits of their labor making our binge watching endeavors delightfully easier!!

  Works well. As I have another Fire TV Stick, it read that set-up and duplicated it on the new Fire TV Stick. Everything works as described. Good processor speed. Plenty of memory for my needs.A review that I read here before purchasing the Fire TV Stick Lite suggested you purchase the lite stick, save $10 and upgrade your remote with the savings. That didn't work for me. An upgraded Fire TV Stick costs about the same as the whole Fire TV Stick does. I have one of the newer Fire TV Stick remotes and paying $10 more for the 4K Fire Stick with more features and a better remote is a bargain.You need to think about how you want to use your system before choosing the right model Fire TV Stick. For example, the volume control on the better Fire TV Stick is worth a lot to me. Also, the 4K has support for my Fire Recast. If all you want is access to a couple of streaming apps, the lite model may be a good choice.  I am happy with what I got for the price I paid. I could have chosen better.

  Yay, HBOMAX is now on Fire Stick, and can be accessed by, well, I pressed the 'sponsored' app link, bright purple, hard to miss. This app has a glorious amount of Criterion movies from TCM, HBO movies, original HBO series, old and new, brand new original HBOMAX series, and lots more. Account registered on one device can be used on all devices.The fire stick lite has so many apps I can't imagine what the one that's not lite has.But as I bought it expressly for HBOMAX, I've not tried anything else yet. Though all my Amazon Prime TV and movies are easily accessible too now.

  I had gotten an Amazon Fire tablet, which I despised, so was never thinking about a Fire stickThe price on this made me consider it for my mom. I had another streaming device I really liked so I was keeping that.I set it up and used it trial run and was very pleasantly surprisedI t works well, setup was just as easy as the other and after a week of using it, I use it now and gave elderly mom the other because of the home screen. It confuses herSo the only complaint I have is the home screen is too busy. WAY too busyToo many Strips to navigate, so much going back and forth, even for the channels I installedI like a homepage I can see my channels, most of them I use often anywayThe Fire you have to scroll sideways on a strip of apps and can only see the first 5Irritating!But it has voice so I can save some time if I use itJust really don't like all the recommendations and side scrolling...Otherwise for the price it's a gem

  For 21 bucks and change I was able to turn a very nice flat screen tv into a Smart TV! No cable required. Just plug the TV in, plug the firestick into the wall/TV, and BOOM, I now have all of my APPS on this TV! The set up was crazy easy. I used my laptop to help with set up and the Firestick literally told me where to go, I plugged in a code, and everything was registered. I did not want to buy another Smart TV, knowing I had this great (older) TV in the basement. I mean, it's kind of a great way to recycle, in my opinion! I even got a free year of Food Network TV (make sure you change the option to bill you monthly at 4.99 at the end of the free year instead of the yearly cost (there are 2 options)--that way if you want and forget to cancel, you'll only be charged a month). Great Price! Comes with BATTERIES! Was able to utilize a TV I already owned. Oh, and Alexa is pretty cool. My kids like the games included. There's Jeopardy and trivia built into the device. Just ask Alexa to play a game.

  honestly, I dont know the difference between the fire stick and the fire stick light.  This one works just as good as the other ones I have seen...with the only difference being the cube since you can talk to it more.  This works perfectly and give us everything we need so we never need to pay for cable.  It is so easy to find everything we are looking for.  Plus it is super cheap.  We own both fire sticks and Rokus...They are so similar... I think the Roku is a little easier to use... especially since it took me a bit to know how to lock purchases!  But it is nice to see shows right away on the screen and not really have to search.  This is a must have!

  The Fire Stick Lite is a lower cost, solution to streaming needs on the go! Although it doesn't have volume control or channel control it is still much faster than old previous generation firesticks and is relatively easy to set up and use, and even is Alexa enabled.  I used this one on my projector to watch outdoor movies and it works great without alot of additional gadgetry.Just get a nice outdoor extension cord and an outdoor rated powerstrip, hook up some speakers and make a nice afternoon with friends outdoors. My streaming functions worked fine with my network.  Just ensure your router is good enough to cast a bit outdoors. Do NOT attempt to use this setup in the rain. But it worked great on a nice dry cool fall afternoon outside by the firepit.  Best of luck and I hope you enjoy your firestick lite as much as I have so far. I liked it so much I've bought one for my parents,  and another for a guest bedroom! They've all worked great!

  I have purchased 2 other fire sticks and had no problems. I got this one for my child’s room, and it’s complete trash. I have to unplug and replug the fire stick every time I cut the tv on to get it to turn on. The remote only worked the first 2 days and then was almost unresponsive. I use the fire stick remote app on my phone instead, which I shouldn’t have to do with a new purchase. Buy a more expensive one, this one is not worth it!!

  I purchased this because a TCL Roku TV all of a sudden refused to connect to WiFi after being moved to a different room (while everything else was fine)  and NO ONE was able to help. Yes, I did all the customer service turn this on, turn this off, reconnect this, etc. etc., etc., ad nauseam. This did exactly what I was hoping and restored Roku capability to the TV. Loses a star because not able to get to live TV button or add it on the Roku stick evidently so now have to use two remotes, but oh, well. Better than having to buy another TV.

  I purchased the Roku for the sole purpose of adding my spectrum cable app to my television and all my other tv apps to have all in one place due to our fire stick doesn’t allow the cable app we have, however when trying to hook it up my husband ran into an issue with the codes that are needed to enter to set it up. We call support, they say we need a subscription for support and if we enter the codes 3 times then the Roku is useless unless we purchase a subscription for him to reset it. I went back and looked at my Amazon order and it didn’t say anything about needing a subscription and paying more money so I call the Roku number for myself and sure enough, I can get it fixed for a year, 3 year or lifetime subscription 😳 (lifetime subscription is like 299) and I told the gentleman Absolutely NOT and have a good day sir! Now I’m out 50 bucks! FYI we thought we were setting up wrong and not following instructions and yes we know how to read but we had already entered the codes more than we should have and rendered it useless before we called the support number so just read as much as you can before purchasing this or go to a store like we’re going to now. We’re not tech savvy people and it could’ve been our error but at the end of the day, I felt like it was a scam considering we got the same representative both times we called. 🤷🏼‍♀️

  My Roku is connected to my Google WiFi system (mesh). At least several times a week, we'll be watching something on TV, but at some random point, the remote stops responding. I'm only able to adjust the volume on my (Samsung) TV and turn the TV's power on/off since it is using the infrared. Most of the time, I have to wait a period anywhere between 10 - 20 seconds, before the remote responds again. Other times, I have to unplug the Roku's power entirely, and wait for everything to turn back on for the remote to work normally again. It's very annoying - especially when you have two toddlers where a quick distraction is needed.I even adjusted my router to have the Roku unit on a static IP address, yet the issue still remains. Based on researching other reviews, it seems no one has able to figure out a solution for this problem. When the remote is working as normal, everything is great with the sound and picture. However, because of the common remote freezing issue, I would NOT recommend buying this Roku model.

  The stick was already activated when I tried to activate it. I had to factory reset in order to activate it to my account. As well, the remote was all scratched and had a blob of white paint on the rear cover, I suppose meaning it was used. In this day and age of Covid, I'm terribly disappointed in Amazon and Roku. ...and it kept hanging up. I had to disconnect the power cord to get it to reboot and respond. I have already ordered a replacement and am returning the original.The picture of the two sticks shows this purchased item on the left, which I am returning. The stick on the right is the replacement. Hmmm. Two different models.The picture of the remotes shows the original purchased remote on the right and the replacement order on the left. Notice the difference? One has a power button the other does not. The quick streaming service buttons are different.The pictures of the USB connector shows a micro-usb connector on the original purchased stick while the other shows a mini-USB connector.So, it appears a previous buyer had a Streaming Stick, purchased a Streaming Stick + then placed the non + model in the + box and returned it to Amazon.If anyone from Amazon is listening, I'd like a response on how that return made to your inventory and into my hands. You've wasted my time.

  Bad model device where previous models worked & work great.  Only two months after first use, it started getting hot &  losing the video voice tracks intermittently. I changed the outlet but it didn’t change the hotness.  I changed the micro-USB-B but that did nothing to the hotness nor voice track losses.  Turning everything off and unplugging the roku streaming stick from the electricity then plugging in again returned voice tracks but intermittently.  Now the stick remotes aren’t recognized at all.  That’s $85 down the toilet including the second remote.

  I got a Roku Streaming Stick+ last year, and it was great for a while. But despite years of calling itself a ""neutral platform,"" Roku has recently dropped support for HBO, and has declined to add support for HBO Max or Peacock, despite the fact that its customers have been asking for it. The entire reason I bought a Roku device in the first place was that it supported all the major streaming services, but that's no longer the case, so I definitely would not buy this device again.

  When I first purchased the Roku Streaming Stick+, I thought it was a nice improvement over my 1st Gen Amazon FireTV Stick with the Roku being able to search multiple apps for specific movies and television while the Firestick pushed Amazon products. Others have complained that the Roku interface looks dated but I found it to be familar and easy to navigate with a quick response time and very little lag. But that is where the positives end for the Roku.I connected the Roku Streaming Stick+ to my Yamaha RX-679 surround sound receiver via HDMI and it played fine at first. But then I started getting frequent, sporadic audio drops where the center channel would simply fade out and the volume would drop so low that it became inaudible. It would stay low for several minutes and then return to normal before repeating the audio issue. I tried numerous app updates, system restarts, system resets, updated the firmware on the Roku and the Yamaha receiver, switched HDMI ports and HDMI cables but nothing resolved the issue.Out of desperation, I returned the Roku Streaming Stick+ to Amazon and purchased a Roku Ultra hoping that would resolve the issue but it didn't. I contacted the Roku support team and listed all of the pertinent details in my original message before receiving a response that seemed to indicate most of my original message had went unread because I was being asked questions that I had already answered. I answered those same questions again and Roku support told me to disconnect the Roku from my AVR and connect it directly to the television, completely bypassing my surround sound system and just using the built-in television speakers.A quick internet search shows that Roku has had audio issues with surround sound systems as far back as Roku 3 and as recently as the Roku Premiere+ so I told the Roku support team to address the issues with their audio coding instead of asking customers to find subpar workarounds. After doing so, the Roku support team claimed that my Yamaha receiver was to blame, marked the claim as being ""resolved"" and closed the ticket.I had the FireTV Stick, a PS4 and an Xbox One all connected to the Yamaha receiver via HDMI and all of those devices played through my 7.1 surround sound system flawlessly. So it is obvious that Roku would rather place the fault within  other components instead of taking responsibility for its own faulty software.My advice is to stay away from Roku if you have any kind of surround sound system. A sound bar may work with the Roku but it seems that audio systems with multiple audio channels will have problems with the Roku software and the Roku support team is completely useless in resolving these issues.

  Amazon stopped supporting Prime Video on my Panasonic Plasma and my Sony Blueray player. I needed a new way to stream. Roku looked like the answer.Roku did not work for me. I purchased three of these in a month. The first one activated in minutes and streamed perfectly for about three weeks. Didn't understand the bad reviews. Then it stopped streaming completely after three weeks. Network was fine. Sent back two days before return window closed.The second one hung up for hours trying to activate. It logged on to my network fine, but It would not finish the activation screen. It gave me the activation code to finish, but before I could enter it, Roku kept giving me a new code. Returned it also.Third one, same as the second one. I've had it with Roku.The first one streamed fine for three weeks, then died. It seems it's hit or miss with Roku.Guess I'll have to try a Fire Stick.Update: Purchased a FireStick 4k after sending back the third Roku.The FireStick was up and running in about ten minutes. It's fast and so far no issues. Also, it's nice to be able to skip intros and ads with the firestick. Sorry I wasted so much time on Roku.

  I'll always be a fan of the fire stick is my first introduction to a different way of watching TV after the antenna was taken outta the picture I'm still not used to this even after all these years but think of all the years I watched with an antenna way more years That than this way but yes Amazon is on it with this the difference between the lite and the regular fire stick besides there's a live TV button to press instead in I'm not sure yet. The smart TV we had died and this temporary old TV we have well this temporary TV think died because of the fire stick LOL  THE temporary TV was 5 years old and not a smart TV so until tax season I'm using my phone because I mean disability only goes so far but my honesty doesn't don't hook up to non smart TV's or to TV's 5 years of age or older LOL.. but yes Amazon fire stick is the only way to go. No extra anything for this either unless you want it. Other than that good good to go

  This is a nice item to have but the upgraded version with volume control it much better. I'm giving this a 3-star rating only because I think Amazon is ripping off its customers by not offering a remote sold separately in case something happens to the remote.Unbeknown to me, my daughters remote got tangled in bedding and ended up going through the washer .There was absolutely nothing wrong with the fire stick itself, on the remote was fried. Buying a new remote by itself cost just as much as a new fire stick with remote so it made sense to buy all new everything. I was forced to buy an entirely new fire stick with remote.and am now stuck with a useless fire stick all because I can't pair another remote with it and it's cheaper to just buy a new fire stick remote.Come on Amazon!!!! you can do better than that with your customers!

  I had an old Roku that started giving me fits recently. I knew it was connected to WIFI, but when I went to load an app it told me I wasn't online. Apparently, this is an old issue with Rokus that hasn't been resolved. I did a factory reset and that fixed the problem, but I saw this Fire Stick Lite was on sale for Black Friday and I decided to give it a try. After using it just for a little while, I don't think I'm ever going back to Roku. I find the user interface to be a lot less clunky, though it probably helps that I've been using Prime Video for years and I'm used to the layout. Aside from Prime Video, adding other streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and YouTube was very simple, as was rearranging them as I desired. The stick itself is very thin, but I still needed to use the short extension they included to make it work with the HDMI port I wanted to use, so it's great that it comes with that. Finally, the remote is very nice. I don't use Alexa or voice searches, but the remote has the buttons I need to easily navigate the interface, play, pause, rewind and fast forward videos, which is basically all I need. So, all said and done, I'm super happy with this Fire Stick Lite. My only regret is that I didn't get a Fire Stick sooner.

  I was not able to determine the difference between the Fire TV Stick and the Fire TV Stick Lite by reading the packaging. You can’t open the boxes so there was no way to visually determine the difference either. I purchase the Fire Tv Stick Lite based on price.  I was disappointed toFind out that there were no TV controls on the Lite so I have to use 2 remotes to stream TV. I need the TV remote to turn on the TV, toadjust the volume or use the mute setting. That is certainly an inconvenience and not what I expected. The device itself works just fine....so I have no complaints.  Just wish Amazon was more clear in their marketing of these products.

  What took me so long to buy this! I bought this and the next one up. Haven't even opened the other one (may give it to my son for Christmas)  but we have been using a blue ray player that has Netflix, prime and youtube for years and it locks up and you can not afd other channels at all. This is exactly what we needed!  And am so happy, from purflex to cbs/abc we can download as many other apps as we pay for or that are free. I love that it hooks to my prime and I can search for a show/movie and it will show me where Its available for me to watch on my channels. (That's probably my favorite thing) I'm not sure I like that it connects to my Alexa because now my Alexa is always running and blinking. And I don't use the voice control because it,  my alexa dot and my phone all try to do what I'm asking even if the for is in the living room it picks up on my request. Trying to figure that out.

  So I recently bought a 2021 Yukon with the Rear Entertainment system.  There are 2 HDMI ports as for some reason GM did not want to integrate roku or fire tv into the system....  but to solve this problem and make it look as clean as I could without having to take the fire stick in and out  I paired this with Fire TV Stick Lite with AmazonBasics USB Type-C to Micro-B 2.0 Cable and Cable Matters Right Angle HDMI Adapter. This was to point the stick down so it does not stick out and get broken off or knocked down by kids getting in and out..  I have had great success since install and the kids really enjoy it.  photos coming soon

  I have been using the 1st generation Fire TV Stick for 6 years now.  It is miserably slow!!!!  Decided to buy the newest generation of the Fire TV Stick Lite version.  I don't have a 4K TV, so this version is fine for my purposes.  And, I'm not so lazy that I have to have all my TV controls on the same remote either.  The Fire TV Stick Lite is fast and works wonderfully!  Am still getting used to the new UI somewhat, but that won't take long.  There was 1 issue of adding an app (EWTN) that I have on my other Fire TV devices .... Amazon kept saying it was incompatible with all of my devices .... even the ones that were currently running the App.  But, I think enough of us complained about the issue and it has been resolved.  I'm as happy as a clam with this new Fire TV Stick Lite.  Price was great too at my local Home Depot .... only $17.99.

  Got specifically to use for Apple TV, because if you have a subscription, you can’t view it on a big screen unless you have one of the specific TVs that Apple tells you will work, and I didn’t.  In my Fire Lite version, it is not on the list of apps that come up, and on my journey to try to find out how to get it, became quite frustrated with the Amazon support chat, and in fact had 4 separate individuals come on to try to help.  3 said “too bad”. #4 finally told me to go “purchase” the app from Amazon App Store. I was so mad! But then realized by “purchase”, they meant FREE.  So it was a frustrating journey that ended well. 1.5 stars for Amazon support :-(TL,DR: if you are already subscribed to Apple TV, and the app does not appear after setting up your FireStick, get the app from Amazon App Store and it will automatically download, and then you just follow the usual steps of logging in via the Stick.

  It's pretty cool to have everything in one place on my TV. I like the various searching tools. It's been good EXCEPT (I don't know if anyone else has this problem) but mine randomly looses sound. There is no reason that I have found why this happens. When that happens I am forced to restart the Fire stick by unplugging it from the power source then plugging it back in. Not sure what else to do.

  Repeatedly failed while trying to add appletv+ app to our (obsolete) “travel” Firestick and after contacting amazon support, we discovered that we had an original edition Firestick that was not compatible with the appletv+ App.  We saw the bonus one year access to the Food Network where we could learn new kitchen skills and purchased this new Fire TV Stick Lite.  We were immediately awestruck with the speed of the light stick.  Apps we had on our old stick were automatically downloaded onto the new light Firestick.Signing into channel apps was easy because we only needed to aim our phone camera at the QR code and the Light Firestick was activated in an instant.  We are so impressed, we may upgrade another older Firestick merely for the speed.Overall, this was a fantastic purchase.Well done Amazon!

  It has many problems. The biggest problem is that it disconnects from the wifi when I am not using it and then wont reconnect until I reboot it. Forums recommended changing the channel of my wifi so I did that twice and it still loses connectivity. It has full wifi bars.The remote is terribly unresponsive. Sometimes you click a button and it works after a few seconds and sometimes it doesn't. I changed the batteries and it didn't help.It recently started turning off momentarily when I walk around as if something is loose and shorting out.Apps occasionally lock up and it remains unresponsive for minutes.I really want to like this thing but it feels like it was developed by Microsoft in 1997. Yes it eventually does what you want but it seems pretty weird to have such an awful user experience in such a cutthroat competitive market.

  I purchased this to hopefully bring order to chaos. I have a smart tv. I stream several streaming services, 1 premium pay, and several free. Each streaming service uses my remote differently, and I was hoping the Roku remote would standardize maneuvering the various menus. No such luck. Really, it added another layer of complexity and confusion to what I already have. I have found myself not even using it. That's on me, I should have researched more carefully. The good news is, the Roku Stick + is fast, works every time without glitches. If you have a nice non-smart tv, this can be a huge help. If you already have a smart tv, not so much. I wish all TV manufacturers and streaming services would collaborate to make a more functional remote with universal functions. I guess that won't happen. Recommended, with caveats.

  I've been using this Roku stick since November 2017 and it is mediocre at best. First the remote goes through batteries like a RC car. Once it gets about 50% battery left i constantly have to remove the cover and take out the batteries and put them back in and it finally works. The biggest problem I have is connectivity. The roku stick is literally 4ft away from my router and it constantly buffers on Playstation vue, Hulu, Netflix you name it. I've went into the secret menus changed things, put the roku on a different channel. I disconnected every single device from using the router and tried still buffering issues. My internet is very consistent at 150mbps. I have no other issues when using Hulu or Netflix via Xbox one. Plus my 12 year old son has a TCL Roku tv and his bedroom is on the other side of the house he doesn't have any buffering issues. I wouldn't recommend this product. Gave it two stars because its easy to use and the menu browsing is quick.Update: Down to 1 star - This remote is absolutely garbage. I contacted support and they said to reconnect the remote. I have to do this multiple times a month. In addition, to the remote i continue to have connectivity issues. The stick is literally a few feet from the router. My son's roku TV has no issues and we also have an older Samsung smart TV with no issues.

  I can't tell you what I like about it because I can't use it.The HDMI port on my TV doesn't allow for the long Roku stick to plug in directly and Roku doesn't include the small wire adapter that allows this as part of the standard packaging. You have to go online to order a free adapter that'll make it work. Ok, so that's a bit irritating. I have this device that I already waited on and now I need to wait for snail-mail to deliver an adapter. Fine! I guess I have no choice.So online I go and fill out my name, email address, shipping address and super long serial number. Press submit and wait for my confirmation. NOPE! Sorry! they're temporarily out of stock on this 3 penny item. I mean, really? You don't a bazillion of these laying in piles since they cost nothing and are a critical component to many customers? But that's not irritating enough, do you think they'd take your order and ship it whenever it becomes available again? NOPE! They simply trash your order (after saving your email for marketing I bet) and expect you to come back day after day after day, fill in ALL your information again, re-submit your order and just to hope that Roku has gotten around to replenishing the critical 3 penny Item.Ridiculous!Utter lack of customer service and lack of respect for end users time.They can 'stick' it (get it? :-) I'm sending it back!

  Good things first: this Roku does a fantastic job with streaming. I've never had network connection issues and the availability of apps is unrivaled.Now the bad: the remote is basically unusable. Unlike most of its competitors using Bluetooth, Roku went with a Wifi-driven remote.  Every single day the remote loses its pairing. The only way to get it to reconnect is to place the remote right next to the device and mash buttons until it finally picks it back up.  And then it'll routinely lose its connection to the remote as you are watching.  Nothing more frustrating than trying to pause a show and having to wait 3 min before it will actually register your button presses!  This is apparently a known problem and is compounded by the fact that our media console and wifi router are near one another.While I loved the device, I can't deal with the completely useless remote.

  I've been using the Wii for about ten years, but they got rid of YouTube a few months ago, and now are getting rid of Netflix, so it's useless technology unless you have old games. The Roku is great for streaming, and no, you do not need to add a credit card as others have mentioned. You only need to add steaming services that you already have, OR use the free channels, as there are several.The Talk to Search is really awesome on the remote control, but it doesn't always recognize what you are saying. The downside is that it only searches all of Roku, not specific channels. For example, if you search YouTube for ""90's Music,"" it will search the Roku channels for it. You can't search within the channel itself using the voice option. It also doesn't always understand very well, even when you're speaking clearly. You can keep repeating it and nothing will populate, but then when you type to search, what the Roku just said was not there by voice, suddenly appears. Very glitchy.There are times that it will freeze on the home welcome screen as well, but turning it off and on helps. Overall, those are the only complaints I've encountered. Setting it up was easy.

  It works really well for an older TV that is ‘smart’ in name only, no more waiting forever for apps to load! I haven’t tested the 4K capability as my other 4K TV already has Roku built-in, but all other features of this Roku stick work like a charm. I actually use the Roku app on my phone to control all my TVs so I don’t mix the little remotes mixed up (roku TV remote is exactly the same as the stick+ but has some different app buttons at the bottom - the Netflix and HBO ones). The stick+ is very fast to start once plugged into the USB service port on my TV for power and of course the stick has to be plugged in HDMI to work. Initial setup was a breeze because I already have a roku account. I got this to fix the apps crashing on my old Sony TV that has YouTube and Netflix but is a couple years old so has trouble loading the apps and buffering streams. The stick+ has no problem with any content I throw at it. The voice control function is neat for the remote, but I prefer the app anyway for the easy text input when I’m searching. The remote is also small so it easy to misplace (especially if you have little ones). I only use the Netflix, Prime, Viki, Plex, and YouTube apps, but roku has a large store of apps available for download. I’d say most people with 4K TVs will already have smart features built-in to their set so you might be able to save with the non-plus version. I only got the stick+ because it had a great sale, making it cheaper than the regular stick.

  I have been using Roku devices for years but this one has 3 issues:1- Remote takes a long time to start working. I thought that the long range controller was an advantage but its actually not as the controller deactivates after sometime and to reconnected at take up to 10 seconds to reconnect which is very annoying.2- If you are using this device outdoor it will just keeps going to the main menu: sometime 4G connection even though  its fast disconnects for a very short time and while in other devices you will not feel a thing as there is a good buffer and it will continue working normally or maybe pause the stream for a short time or until your connection is back. The roku will close your application and bring you to the setting menu to select network and you have to set it up all over again after that u will have to go back to the application, wait for it to load, select your user, search again for the video and forward until the point where its stopped working.3- Voice controls are not compatible with netflix or youtube.

  Roku device is good at streaming, lots of free options if you don't have cable or other subscriptions. Picture quality is good most of the time, sometimes looks poor but eventually clears up. My biggest complaint would be the REMOTE. YOU NEED THE REMOTE FOR THE ROKU DEVICE TO FUNCTION!!! but the design is poor. I have to reconnect the remote EVERY DAY and often it will not connect at all. I have contacted Roku about this but they never responded. They have many problems with this and all they offer is a ""how to"" for connecting your remote. Unplug tv, unplug roku stick, remove batteries from remote, plug back in, turn on, put in batteries, press button...AND IT STILL DOES NOT WORK! You can use the Roku app on your phone as a remote but this wears down your battery and monopolizes your phone if you want to use it for anything else. You know, to make a phone call or something... Roku should be a great product but with a defective remote it is really frustrating and annoying to use. I wouldn't want to have to deal with this on more than one TV, reconnecting them all EVERY SINGLE DAY, something that is integral to the function of the device!

  The set-up was a breeze and the only minor issue is the sales pitches for numerous ""pay station"" apps you have to navigate through before you activate the roku.  I have no idea where the one customer called to have someone ask for $70 because they had multiple rokus on one account. The instructions clearly point out roku does NOT charge for activating devices so beware of scams.  It appears someone tried to scam the customer.  Wifi reception was strong and 4K streaming is breath taking.  This replaced an older roku device that finally bit the dust.  A plus is the ability to control tv power and volume with the roku remote, which automatically sync to our Samsung tv.  Well worth the sale price paid.

  This is my third Roku.  I have it on three two different sets.  First problem I had was after months of using the Roku, it went from 5.1 to stereo PCM 2.0.  I don’t understand how this happened when there is only my wife and I at home and she never touches the receiver or any of its features.  When home she watches cable.I purchased another, this one, which I am reviewing, in December.  It is now March 16, 2019, and while watching Hunter Killer it didn’t sound right.  I noticed it’s playing in 2.0 PCM.  I checked the settings on the Roku, also on my Anthem receiver.  They are correct.  So this is another device that has given me this problem.  I’m through with Roku and will next purchase a Fire Stick and hope that it’s better than this POS which is very annoying to say the least.

  I returned the Roku Streaming Stick+ that I bought in 2018  because it would not connect.  This 2020 Roku Streaming Stick+ connected to my dumb TV quickly, and the wi-fi is fast.  The included wi-fi extended might be the difference.  I am not seeing the lag that I noticed with the Roku Ultra over wi-fi.  I also got three months of CBS All Access commercial free to binge Picard etc..  The Ultra draw was that I could connect it to the ethernet and improve my signal, future proof the device with options such as an SD card, and have a headphone jack backup to my Bluetooth earbuds.  However, the streaming stick cost, speedy operation, and CBS deal beats the Ultra advantages.The only problem that I have had so far is that YouTube would not connect to the profile I wanted, leading me to delete an obsolete profile that used the same e-mail address.

  Roku Streaming Stick+ is useful if your TV is set far enough to cause lag or connection problem using other streaming stick.  Previously, I used Amazon Firestick.  Over time I started having lag where it took long time if I switch between programs or even lost signal completely.I searched the web and I was intrigued by Roku's claim of improved Wifi reception of Streaming Stick+.  I was dubious at first because while checking for other reviews on internet, I read articles where the reviewer didn't seem to notice any improvement in Wifi reception of their test unit.Set up was pretty straight forward.  You will have to set up Roku account if this is your first Roku.  I found Roku remote superior to Amazon's Firestick remote because it also double as TV remote.Of course, you don't need Streaming Stick+ version if you have no lag issues on Wifi reception.Update:  I still have some lag issues but compared to my old Amazon stick lag is shorter duration and recovery is quick once I get out and get back in.

  I've owned them since the very first ""roku netflix player"".  I've had boxes, sticks, ultras, etc.  Maybe 10-12 of them in total over the years.I bought this stick+ for an advertised 3 month CBS all access deal for free, which wasn't much less than I paid for the stick.  Humorously, I needed another remote control and the stick+ with remote was $10 more than just the remote.The deal had to be activated by 4/5.  Its now 3/31.  Won't work.  Roku advertised this special offer for months, and still has it on their site, but now it says you have to click through their site to a retailer to get it.  It didn't say that last month when I bought it.  They refuse to budge.Along the way, I've found their tech support to be bad when it used to be pretty good.  I've also had their top of the line Ultra's simply not work properly with my off brand Sony and Samsung tv's (sorry, had to toss out a pun) giving me errors, the remotes stopping working altogether, various streaming issues where I could literally unplug the roku and plug a fire tv 4k box into the same cable and it'd work fine.""Its a problem with your network, cables or tv"".No Roku, you simply make some problematic products these days, have made the activation process onerous (MUST provide name, credit card, address, phone number, birthdate and gender), and you don't honor your deals.Fun part is, those early roku's I bought still worked fine, as did their remotes, albeit very slowly when I checked them out and factory reset them before recycling them a few years ago.

  Let me start out by saying that I am fine with the picture and audio quality, but I am not all about that to begin with, so I may not be the best judge of it.  I installed this on a TV we don't used very often.  My issue is that when I turn it on, it freezes at the screen saver, the volume up and down works, but I can't get to the TV, Netflix or anything.  I have to turn it off and on, sometimes unplug it because it is frozen and won't do anything.  I just turned the sound off for the button because I read that could cause it, but I just did that, so not sure if that is a good fix. When it works, it is great.  I will update in a few weeks.I was going to wait to update, but I just got so frustrated trying to get this thing to work I had to downgrade my rating.  I have tried everything to get this thing to work.  I restarted it, unplugged and restarted it multiple times, and no luck.  There are a lot of people having issues like I am having, just do an internet search on Roku freezing.Okay, after trying for 45 minutes to get this to work I found a website that said to refresh the remote.  I had no clue I would have to wipe the remote clear and then pair it again with the stick.  Finally working, but it will be interesting to see how often I will have to do this.Absolute junk!!!!!!!!

  There is a whole lot to like about the Roku and the features and services provided.  Unfortunately, that is all overshadowed by  ongoing hardware issues.  I have two Roku Streaming Sticks+.  So far, one has not given me any problems.  The other one does not maintain a pairing between the Streaming Stick and the remote.  I have had to re-pair multiple times, and unless I use a precise order of steps, I can't even get the re-pairing to work.  That is just waaaay too much hassle for a product that should have worked out the bugs by now.  If I cannot find a more permanent solution, my wife will force me back to cable or satellite TV, because she just will not deal with the problems of this hardware.The steps I have found to work best to re-pair my remote with the Roku Streaming Stick+, should you wish to stay with a product this buggy.Unplug Roku - just pull the plug that goes into the stick.Take batteries out of remote.Put batteries back into the remote (leave the back off).Green light should be flashing.  If not, try pressing reset button for 3 seconds.Plug power back into the Roku - with the remote nearby.The pairing process should begin.Good luck.  I'm losing my patience.Edit:  I contacted the seller and asked for a replacement.  The seller quickly responded and replaced my unit.  Thus, I have zero issues with the seller.  Well guess what?  The new Roku does exactly the same thing as the last one.  Overnight, the remote loses pairing with the stick and I have to go through setup all over again.  To add to my frustration, one of the steps required is to remove the batteries from the remote.  The battery case is so poorly designed it is very difficult to remove the batteries and requires some type of tool.  Fingernails just won't do it.I have tried an experiment that seems to reduce the incidence of lost pairings.  I place the remote very close to the Roku stick.  Distance seems to be a factor.  My couch is about 15' from my TV.  But seriously, 15 feet is too far to maintain pairing?  I have Bluetooth devices that never lose connection at considerably more distance.Bottom line:  I am very sorry I went with Roku.  The service is great, the hardware sucks.

  So, for whatever reason, Roku did not include the wireless component of the unit in the actual stick. Roku decided to add it to the USB cable that gives the unit power (the ""Advanced Wireless Receiver""). Unfortunately, that cable is the weak link in the system. Having now owned three of these, I can tell you that if your TV is mounted on a wall and you need to extend the USB cable longer than the included extension, you are out of luck- regular USB cable extensions that you buy won't have the wireless component, so your stick won't see the remote or your wi-fi. Likewise, if your HMDI ports are mounted vertically, when you plug the cable into the unit all of the strain is on the connector which will eventually fail. It will still pass power (sometimes), but you won't get any wireless connections. And if you get a great idea to buy a 90 deg adapter for the cable, you're SOL there, too- just like extensions, no adapters work with the USB/ AWR cable in the box.As I stated, I have owned three of these units in the past year. I will not be owning a fourth. I don't know what I'll do, but it won't be this.TL:DR- Because Roku made its failure-prone proprietary USB cable essential to the unit with no ability to adapt, extend, or replace it, these units are not worth your time or money.

  I've had previous generations of Roku products. I've had AppleTVs. I have a FireTV stick. My TV has crappy online streaming features. After trying pretty much all the options for streaming TV I keep coming back to Roku products. They're reasonably priced and are almost constantly on sale. They're platform agnostic and support any subscription service you can throw at it. Setup is easy and consistent. I rarely have had a Roku product software crash or misperform. I don't yet have a 4K TV nor do I use the voice search function much, but I still got this model just to future proof myself. I tend to use the physical remote instead of the phone remote, but the mobile app works in an emergency and is intuitive and available for iOS and Android.

  Let me preface this with I have owned every single Roku since the initial model (over a decade ago now). Roku as a platform has grown exponentially since then, and I am proud to use them on all of my TVs. This Roku stick is almost indistinguishable from its full size counter part in terms of speed and quality. I went with the stick form because it was for a projector and I did not want to run another HDMI cable through the ceiling.For those who are posting about a scam or being held “hostage” by support, make sure you actually go to Roku’s website, and check the SSL certificate. (This is why we don’t google URLs when they’re presented to you on the screen...). Roku does not force any fee to activate and they don’t cap the number of devices (they don’t even require a payment method on file to use, unlike another streaming stick I know). If you were told otherwise, you were made a fool of by a scammer who took advantage of you not checking the URL.The new remote with this stick is so light and thin, a major improvement over the older generations! My only complaint is that the library of remote commands (TV power, volume and mute) is restricted to TVs- not AVRs and Projectors. You can usually google it and find a brand that uses the same code to map it to get it to work- just not as simple.While I’m a firm believer in always wiring streaming devices to your network (I.e. Ethernet port), this stick does a great job streaming 4K over WiFi regardless of the fact that it’s in a terrible spot for WiFi coverage (behind a projector with a lot of interference and hanging off the ceiling).

  I purchased this, simply because it does not control the TV. I control it with it's own remote. This gives tons of options for watching TV. You don't have to be stuck with Network TV or only a couple of streaming sites. This offers so many and it does the job I bought it for. I have no complaints. It was easy to set up, and connect to the internet. I may purchase the Ethernet Adapter to connect with a wired connection so I don't have to use Wi-Fi. Makes us dizzy and grouchy. I highly recommend this for anyone needing a new streaming device without spending a ton of money on a device. (Like a new Blu-Ray Player). Prime Video, Netflix, Pluto TV and so many other options. Your local TV station may have an app to allow you to watch their newscast live. This is great for those of us who cut the cord years ago.

  Been using ROKU's (3) for years. They have become somewhat unreliable. Remotes often go bad and unit also begins to malfunction. BUT it was simple to use as long as it worked. Fire is overwhelmingly complicated compared. Offerings are confusing. Has an universal search that implies somethings are free but they are not - only the app have to pay for a ""provider"". Still learning but wastes a lot of time. Not very intuitive. As you scroll for apps it starts a preview they are pushing right away. Very irritating

  No tv controls sounds like a minor inconvenience but this also means NO power button for the Fire Stick. Always running means it does not clear it cache etc (Refresh its self)  unless restarted in the setting (Very inconvenient w/ multiple clicks) or unplugging the device. We have now sent back ever single fire stick lite due to consistent customer issues. All complaints were consistent with it not responding correctly, loss of sound, & loss of Ch if using the Fire Recast. Customers would have to unplug and plug back in ever day to get sound to work, For the recast issue factory resting would make it work for a day or two. All customer were upgraded to a Fire Stick 4k and have had no issues.

   I love my new fire stick! Ive had it for just about 2 weeks and it works great! I included a picture of the box that looked a little beat up when I opened the package, but everything inside was perfectly fine.I purchased this after returning a Google chromecast on Amazon and leaving a pretty bad review. Thankfully, the purchase of the Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite worked out much better.I purchased the Lite option for a few dollars less than the price of the original Fire TV Stick option. The only difference is that the Lite does NOT have a power button or a volume control. I don't think this is too inconvenient, but it might have been worth the extra few dollars just to have everything in one.Keep in mind that there are a lot of different streaming services offered on the Fire TV (netflix, Disney+, CBS all access, YouTube, etc) but while most of the available apps are free to download, most of them require a subscription to actually use. With that being said, there is a ""free"" tab on the home screen that gives options to watch for free WITH ads. If you don't subscribe to any streaming services though, and don't like ads/commercials, this device probably won't be of much use to you.I have an Amazon Echo 1st generation, and was easily able to connect it to my new fire stick in the Alexa app. As you can see in the video, there is a few seconds delay, but it works pretty well (and I rested the remote on the TV so you can see that it really is the Alexa taking control)Although there is no power button on the remote, the TV did shut off when I said ""Alexa turn off my TV"" but it did not turn back on when I said ""Alexa turn on my TV"". The Echo did not respond to volume commands pertaining to the TV. It's not a total loophole, but being able to turn the TV off is a little extra since I expected to exclusively need my TV remote to control power and volume. Either way, it was easy set up and provides convinient handsfree watching. Pressing and holding the microphone button on the remote while speaking allows all of the same voice commands as the Echo, without needing to say ""Alexa"", and the delay is significantly LESS than when using the Echo. The commands that I have discovered and used so far are: open an app; play a movie/show/song (if you don't specify which app, it will give you your options, or you can specify which app in the original command); turn off the TV; play/pause; skip/rewind; what time is it?; What's the news?; Home; open settings. There are also suggested voice commands that pop up at the bottom of the home screen every now and then if you just leave the home screen open.The remote takes 2 AAA batteries, and 2 were included, so that was nice to not have to go get any separately.A small extension cord is included incase things are cramped around your HDMI port and you can't have the Fire Stick pointing straight out. I did not need this, but it seems like an important feature to make sure noone has any trouble setting the device up.Overall, this is a great device and has made streaming very easy. It works well and I would highly recommend it.

  I can't even get it set up. When trying to connect to my wifi I almost always get the same error message. ""Could not contact Amazon.com..."" I returned it and got a replacement that did the same thing. I have 15 wifi devices in this house and all of them worked without any hassle. I've spent hours with Amazon technical support trying to get this to work. It worked for about a day and then stopped again. It is not worth all the trouble. Google ""Could not contact Amazon.com..."" Lots of people have this problem. Then when I tried to return the second one, I was faced with yet another hassle. They wanted to troubleshoot it again. I didn't want to do that. I was fed up with this thing and just wanted it out of my life forever. It took a while to convince them that I would only accept a refund.

  ****Review edited****I was originally super disappointed in my fire stick and it not working. I was having the issue with it going to sleep then not turning back on. After being frustrated and talking with tech support online I received a phone call. The person from Amazon was extremely helpful. Walked through some trouble shooting things. Looked up the book for my TV as of course I didn't have it. Helped find if there were settings off in my TV and factory re set the fire stick. Got my fire stick to work like it should and even called back the next day to be sure it was still working well. Wonderful customer service and of course love the fire stick. Especially love the extener on this one so I am able to use both home cords and don't have to switch between 2 devices at the plug.

  I love the Amazon Fire Stick, it works so much better than the Roku (in my opinion). I have been using this product for many yrs and I have always found it quite enjoyable. I had to upgrade my Fire Stick when my old one finally kicked the bucket. I chose this one because of the price as I needed one in a hurry and I was strapped for cash at the time. It is a handy device to have and mine worked well at first, but now it is freezing a lot. I do believe that I got a defective one. That can happen when things are mass-produced like these are. Overall the device is great and I can stream all sorts of channels at the touch of a button. Alexis is quite good at finding what I ask for, and I have never had any real trouble with my stick before. This is the first fluke that I have ever experienced while using this product. I do recommend giving it a try (if you already haven't) as it is a great companion for your TV...

  I snagged this on black Friday special for $17.99 just to add streaming capabilities to the TV in my room at my parents house. I was visiting for a month and didn't want to break the bank. It was totally worth the price, even for just the month. It was a little glitchy but to be honest my TV is old. I had the Alexa fire cube 2nd generation and this worked just as well for a fraction of the price, it just doesn't have as many features. I ended up purchasing two more of these little babies before the deal ended to leave at a condo I visit a couple times a year. I have all google devices in my home now, which I actually prefer, but this was a steal (Chomecasts are $30!)If you found this review even the least bit helpful please smash that 'helpful' button below! Thanks :)

  I purchased the Fire Stick Lite for a Sony Smart TV which has limited streaming apps. The only way to access more apps was to connect another device. I already purchased a previous model Fire stick for an older television so I purchased one for the Smart TV. The set up is very easy through the prompts on the TV. The only problem was that the AAA batteries that were included for the remote control were not good. This is why I had problems with the set up initially. Once I swapped those out for new batteries, set up was simple. I recommend the Fire Stick Lite for anyone who wants a simple set up and does not want or need the remote to control the TV.  The main menu lists all the available apps and it was easy to find what I needed. Setting up Alexa remote control is very easy as well although I do not use the voice feature frequently. You can also set up different profiles on the home page for each user which is nice.

  With broadcast TV so messed up with series not being done due to Corvid, We brought our first Fire Stick.  I'm impressed with all the movies and series you can watch.  Wish I would have checked this out years ago, but was discouraged with my Vizio smart TV and what little I saw, was not working well.  The Fire stick works great with using 5gh on my router that I never used before.  My error.  Bought one from Amazon for $21.00 and now want a second for my wife's TV.  Now priced $8.00 higher than my first purchase.  What a rip off.  Found another vendor that was selling same product for $22.00 and ordered from them.  Amazon ordering direct is just screwing you at an additional $8.00 over the first sale.  Also have to delay another Amazon order to meet free shipping.

  This version of the Fire TV stick is an absolutely amazing upgrade over the previous generation. My original stick was still working, but I was never 100% happy with its processing speed. Read the reviews for this version and decided to give it a go and am so glad that I did!The processing speed for all features is great! Moving between apps and menus is super-smooth and there is no noticeable lag time at all. The difference between this version and the original stick really is like the difference between dial-up and cable internet.Set-up was effortless, as with all of the Amazon products that I've bought. Literally plug it in and go!If you have the original and are thinking about upgrading; I highly recommend doing so.

  I purchased this item about 18 months ago but didn't take it out of the box until two weeks ago.  I encountered problems in set up which, upon investigation, was not a unique event- it wouldn't finish set-up, got caught in a loop, etc.  I contacted customer support, admitting the ""old"" nature of the device.  It took 3 days for any response.  The first response told me to try some things which I did with no success and contacted them again.  2 days later they said it was out of warranty.  After a few back-and-forths they offered me a 30% discount on buying 2 devices.  That was fine but when I put in the discount codes it would only give me 15% on one device (and the 2nd device could have been bought for the same discounted price directly.  We are now 17 days into the process with their last non-automated response telling me the matter is settled.  Obviously it is not.  Maybe most of the devices are good but customer service is sadly lacking.

  We have purchased 4 over the course of the past month.  The first one wouldn't connect to the TV.  We thought it was odd but eventually got it to work (after unplugging and plugging back in several times).  After about a week, there was no sound.  We resolved this by unplugging and plugging.  This happened several more times, so we tried a different (NEW) fire stick.  That one would not connect at all.  We tried different TVs - nothing.  Not only that, the remote became incredibly hot to the touch.The third one connected without a problem, but has also had the volume problem.  I don't know if this is just a bad batch, but this is a bit ridiculous.  The fourth was intended to be a gift, but I don't know if that is a good idea, knowing that the other 3 we bought are terrible.

  I have completely enjoyed my Fire Stick Lite very much. My husband doesn’t do well with installing anything with WIFI, but with this he didn’t have any problems. I keep my Fire Stick in our bedroom on a TV bought in 2013, therefore, it isn’t able to do EVERYTHING that is advertised about it, but it still does quite many things that have been advertised! I fully enjoy the Fire Stick Light! I would, have, and do recommend this for everyone!

  I have used several fire sticks and even bought some for friends and family.  When the less then 6 month old one quit working, I went to customer service to see if they could help me figure out why it wasn't working.  After leading me through steps I told the customer agent I had already done (so it ended up being done twice) All he could say to me is my warranty is expired.  I spend around 100 a month on amazon if the customer service continues to be poor I will have to find a new online realtor.

  I decided to purchase this because I didn't have the option to watch Amazon Prime through my blu-ray player (it's an older version with only a few apps like Netflix and Hulu).  I wish I had purchased this sooner.  I only had to plug it in and there are so many options.  Plus, my Netflix is so much more responsive through the fire stick.  I also like the microphone which makes it so much easier to find my shows.  The best part was downloading the Silk internet app so I can watch certain performances etc on a large scale as opposed to watching on my laptop.  The lite version works just fine for me as I really don't care if I have to use the cable remote for the volume etc.  Such and affordable solution.  Very happy.

  This product came shipped with a half baked OS. I have a Recast and it works for both live and recorded content on my other 4k sticks and my previous fire stick 1st generation fine. The first generation fire stick was getting too slow and I thought it would be a good idea to get this Lite. Boy was I wrong! I can't watch both live and recorded content from CBS, ABC, NBC, AND FOX local affiliates. The weird thing is the other public channels and PBS work fine. I spent 2 hours on the phone with 2 reps since I got disconnected with the first one and I am waiting on a resolution. I just do not understand how something that works fine with the same display and a 4k and OG stick are fine and not with this Lite product.

  I bought it on the Prime Day. I am glad that I did it. For under $20, I got everything I wanted for an old LED TV. It was very easy to set up - less than 5 minutes and very easy to use (same as the previous version - this is my third Fire Stick). With my recent purchased Fire Recast, I can see all OTA TV channels on this old TV that I cannot get good reception in downstair. Provided, I can see all the Prime Video in this TV plus these extra free channels. I highly recommend it - especially for Prime Members.

  This is a Roku house - but there's no HBO MAX app for Roku, and I like to run ""SmartYouTubeTV"" to watch YouTube without commercials, which Roku doesn't allow.  When this tiny Fire Stick went on sale for $18, I grabbed one.  It runs MAX and a couple of ad-free YouTube Android APKs flawlessly.  You'll have to side-load the needed Android apps, which Google will tell you how to do.  The small Fire Stick Lite and its accessories seem solid and well-built.  The finish and packaging suggest it's being sold at a loss.It took a couple of hours to install the apps and launcher necessary to get rid of Amazon's home screen commercials - but it was worth the trouble.  This Fire Stick is as snappy in operation as a $40 Android TV Box.  See the picture for the clean and uncluttered home screen you can get with a custom launcher.

  I was skeptical of the Fire TV Stick and if I would use it. It's engineering marvel, why? You can download hundreds of apps which vary depending on your use. I currently use it to view movies, news, weather and access music via YouTube. The remote is easy to use with a quick on-screen menu. The setup was relatively easy, but I'm computer guy. The only drawback it, does NOT interface with your TV. So if you want access to hundreds of movies, news, weather and also search the web all for FREE. The exception is the cost of internet (recommend 50 megabits or more) and the Fire TV Stick. I currently pay about $65 a month for internet at 50 megabits. Drop your $250 a month cable bill and use the money to buy new wardrobe, car, vacation fund, bitcoin or start college fund for the kids. I almost forgot to mentioned it comes with ALEXA voice, which works as advertised. 4 stars

  There is no volume control on this version, but ots not something I was looking for. The video quality is great and it now streams HBO Max, which was the selling point for me. The remote is easy to use l, and the voice control is a huge plus l, specially if you have kiddos. My toddler loves it, because she can open her Netflix or Disney+ without help.The only downside is the set up. It's a little more complicated than the Roku, but I guess the voice command compensates for that.

  I am old, old, old ""school"" and do not use the voice recognition feature.  I'm a button-kind-of-guy, but the fewer the better, and this one is just right, EXCEPT for a couple of features.  First, of course, you need a good quality (does not mean expensive) streaming TV and Internet.  Quality of ours (Roku) is pretty good.  The features I do NOT like are:The size of the remote/stick might be OK for a child's hand but it is difficult for man hands.  It is also super slick, like slide-out-of-my-hand slick.  Lastly from me, the volume control on the side is awkward to use, and there is an echo/feedback situation competing with our sound bar unless I put this remote on mute.  Even then, I or someone else sometimes inadvertently touch the up/down volume buttons and have to hit mute again if I notice the interference with the TV sound bar.  Functionally, the device works great (and there are a lot of programming choices), but the design of the handheld REALLY needs improvement.

  I have a Vizio M55-D0.The only port this device fits in is the Side HDMI as the shape of the TV back prevents a direct plug in. Using the side HDMI port I get HDCP error immediately upon playing any video, the menus work fine, but zero content will play.I overcame this by purchasing a 90"" elbow to plug this into the rear HDMI port (there is no flex connector or adapter in the package for compatibility issues fyi). Now most video plays... Strangely when I purchase explicit content (PPV, ESPN+ non-prime, non-netflix) I get HDCP errors that come up every few minutes show for a few seconds and then disappear - this pains me because I'm trying to enjoy purchased content, and usually hosting guests when doing so.Thought I could work through this will ROKU support. They send you instructions similar to the initial step 1 of calling the your internet provided in the early 2000s. Have you tried turning it off and on, then also unplugging and then plugging it back in again (to each HDMI port on the TV) - yup.Maybe I have older tech or something, but it plain doesn't work consistently for copyright issues, not necessarily the device not working - which is painful because it seems the device is nice, but the content cannot be delivered.2016 year model TV and 2018/19 Roku just won't play well together

  This is my third Roku, and it's the first one with a remote problem.  Presumably it's because it's now a stick instead of a box, so it's plugged into the back of my stereo receiver.  The remote was unreliable out of the box, and when I checked on the Roku website I was told to order a free ""extension cord"" for the Roku, to get it away from the HDMI ports.  That has only helped a bit. Every time I turn on the stereo and Roku, the remote is unworkable for a while.  I keep pushing buttons and then all of a sudden it's good.  But then later on it might stop working again.  I checked the batteries in case they sent me some that were nearly dead, but the meter says they are good.Why is Roku selling a device that supposedly has a long-distance RF remote when the RF signal apparently isn't strong enough to overcome interference?  The Fire TV stick plugged in next to it has no remote problems at all.  I may return this.

  Last month we finally cut the cord and went with Roku.  For the most part we are happy with Roku and I really like the voice command function.  Also, it's very easy to add new channels such as Disney+ and HBOMAX, but after a full month of use here are my not-so-good impressions.  1.) The controller does the job but I wish it had additional features such as switching back to the previous channel with the touch of a button.  Performing this task is a bit awkward and requires several button clicks.  2.)  Thus far we've already replaced the  batteries after one month.  3.)  For some reason the volume control will suddenly cease to function.  I found that if I unplugged the fob in the TV, thus rebooting it, the volume function returned.  Weird.  That said, I would still make the same purchase.  It just takes some getting used to.

  The Roku SS+ was easy to pair to my TV and could power it on and off, and adjust the TV speaker volume. However, I was disappointed that I was not able to get the Roku remote to control my Sonos playbar which is hooked up to my LG TV via optical out. Prior to purchase I called Roku to make sure the remote could control my TV and Sonos. They told me that if my TV supported Consumer Electronics Control (CEC), I'd be fine. But they were wrong. My hours of googling suggested that If you use ARC over HDMI to connect your sound bar to your TV, Roku TV can use CEC to control the sound bar’s volume (maybe). But, if you're hooked up by optical out - you are going to have to buy a logitech smart hub to get one controller.But, all my gripes are about the remote and lack of control. As expected, the Roku device itself is great and the user interface is way better than my lame LG WbOS smart TV.

  I purchased this on May 2, and it was delivered on May 11.  As of yesterday, it is no longer eligible for return to Amazon.It was great when it worked, for all of 4 weeks, or approx 40 hours.  Then is start freezing up and none of the buttons on the remote would function at all.  I changed the batteries, but that made no difference.  The streaming stick is plugged into an electrical socket, not a USB port.  Freeze, reboot, freeze, repeat.Today, it does absolutely nothing.  No off/on function...completely dead.  This remote is as useless as the rest of this Roku Streaming Stick +.

  Same issue as many others apparently... out of the blue, six months in, nothing talks to the device anymore.  Runs red hot within only a couple minutes too.I'm honestly now convinced that Roku streaming devices, and their remotes, are too flimsy and janky to justify buying, and that the ""savvy consumer"" would be well advised to spring for something a little more sound.Had to replace the remote that came with it to see if that was the issue, and then of course had to return the replacement after that TOO failed to pair... at which point I walked into an amazing discussion with an Amazon rep trying to ""solve my issue"" by teaching me how to use the Roku app. as a remote instead  -___-  at which point it HAD been made clear that I was trying to return this thing for a refund after it out-of-the-box failed to function...So if you're following, the rep. was trying to prevent a refund for a defective item by teaching a customer how to use a different item instead.  Brilliant.After 30 min. the refund was agreed to WITHOUT requiring a USPS pick-up, which was odd, and when they agreed to the refund they also said something to the effect of ""because you're a valued customer..."", which was ALSO odd hahaha shouldn't it just be ""because that thing you bought no work..."" ?Ultimately it was fun watching AdultSwim on this cheap toy while it lasted, but now I'll probably have to purchase a more solid competing device and toss this thing altogether :(

  I have very high expectations for my audio/video gear. When streaming audio or video, I am used to using a home theater PC connected to my TV via a receiver. This is fantastic for most things, but it isn't very convenient or easy to use. Additionally and unfortunately, many streaming apps for Windows don't support the highest level of audio or video quality, which is very frustrating.To solve the convenience, ease of use, and quality problems, I purchased one of these. And the Roku Streaming Stick+ is very convenient (small, easy WiFi connectivity), easy to use (great interface), and allows me to stream high quality from apps like Netflix and Disney+.However, there are a few major problems with this piece of gear:1. Ads. I hate that there are ads littered about the Roku interface. Come on.2. No advanced features such as A/V sync offset. For some reason, audio in certain Roku apps is out of sync from the video. Neither my receiver nor my TV have options for modifying this sync - usually, I just change that setting per-application on my HTPC, and I'm happy. But there exists no such setting on Roku, which makes certain content unwatchable.3. The first copy of this piece of hardware I got from Amazon was dead on arrival and wouldn't turn on. I returned that Stick and purchased a replacement.

  After having Directv satellite for 18 years at my house (which I loved despite the breaks during storms), I called customer service because monthly price has gone from $92 to $163 in the past year, but they refused to discount any further so time to say goodbye to Directv.  After some research I decided on Youtube TV.  Next it was looking for a streaming device.  I am a channel surfer so quickness navigating between apps and programs to stream was of high importance.  I have an Asus RT-N66U router and Spectrum 100MB cable internet so bandwidth shouldn't limit me.  I first tried the streaming Stick + from Roku which gets glowing reviews.  I connected it via my 5G wireless (in the next room about 8' away from the TV) and it was very sluggish and reported a slow internet connection.  Doing a connection test in the ROKU reported 1Mb/s though the laptop on speedtest on the same wireless reported 54Mb/s.  I've had spotty coverage in the house with the 5G wireless so I switched to the slower and Roku was then happy with the porformance showing nearly what the laptop did.Pros - I like the Roku menus, DVR setup, layout, and the simple remote... Using a Panasonic Plasma 1080P, the picture is excellent with absolutely no complaints.  I didn't test anything with soundCons - What I don't like is the latency when switching among apps or when kicking off a stream.  Seems to buffer for about 8-10 seconds before the program starts playing.  I'm guessing this is buffering because if I compare what is streaming for a local channel to antenna input on the TV for the same channel, the Roku was about 8-10 seconds behind.  I have Youtube TV, Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix with the slowness the worst with Youtube TV.  I also don't like that you can't set a particular app to automatically run on startup.At less than one third the cost of Directv, I'll stick with it but it feels like going backwards in performance... like if you had to get rid of the SSD in your Core-I7 laptop for a slow hard drive.Note that I moved the streaming stick + to the bedroom TV and got a Roku Ultra for the main TV.  This time connected to ethernet and Roku reporting 78 Mb/s or better.  While the performance is slightly better, it still doesn't have the quickness I'd like.  I'll keep watching reviews for something better...

  I have replaced my Fire Stick with a Roku as this device seems to handle weak Wi-Fi signal much better.  The other big issue I has was having amazon.com and amazon.co.uk accounts.  For reasons unexplained the .co.uk account had become the ""default"" when setting up the Fire Sticks I had purchased,  basically locked me out from viewing US content.  Amazon customer service fixed this promptly when I figured out how to talk to a human but it was an inconvenient and confusing issue.  The Fire Stick is cheap and works but the inferior ability to handle poor wi-fi signal in my use case meant it was not fit for purpose.  Also pairing hand controller with Stick after battery replacement is not obvious.  Need to press the Home button for 30-90 seconds to get it pair sometimes.

  This is more of an FYI than a review.I have a TV mounted pretty high up on the wall so the power cord included does not reach the closest outlet. I did not have a power extension cord but I did have a USB extension.  Little did I know that it would cause my fire stick to constantly reboot. I thought there was something wrong with my fire stick so I exchanged it for another with the same problem. The only common denominator was that USB extension. The extension worked well with other products but not with the fire stick. So if you are having problems with the fire stick constantly rebooting check your power source. I ended using the USB from the TV for the power source. Even though it said that it was not sufficient power it still works fine. Even when playing Amazon's Luna. Or just buy a traditional power extension cord.

  I have reached a point in life where the TV commercials are getting so annoying that I literally avoid watching commercial TV. So Netflix, Amazon, Acorn, Discovery+ are my go to places. The Firestick adds internet connectivity to  any TV without it and improves connectivity for a smart TV.  I can pay for those services I like. Watch better quality programming in HD, without annoying commercials. After trying out one unit I have now bought 5 for every TV in our house and vacation house. With my subscription services I get programming I like for about 1/3 of the cost of satellite service.

  All I'm going to say is worth every penny... not sure why i didn't invest in one of these a long time ago... I'd highly recommend it, even without the deal, it's still worth $29.99. I'm in love already. 😍 I've been using my note 10/ Samsung dex with an hdmi cable to stream TV/ movies from my phone to the TV, & it's a pain in the a$$! The wire would get bumped & id lose what I was watching, have to get up to change to different apps, etc. Plus, my phone was always hooked up to my TV & then when I'd unplug it to use my phone, my 16 month old daughter would flip out because her Disney Channel was no longer on... no more worries 😌 it's a win win for mommy, & my daughter. BUY THIS! My first time using 1 & I love it. My next purchase will be a echo dot.

  The Fire TV Stick Lite is a huge improvement over my First Generation Fire TV Stick.I had recently started having problems with the remote with my first generation draining batteries in less than a week and a new remote for the old one cost more than the new Fire TV stick lite did. I got a deal on it too for Superbowl special pricing.I also have a second generation Fire TV stick and this new one is so much better than the old ones.It loads the interface immediately and there is zero buffering or lag like I sometimes had with the old one. The old one would reset without warning and was annoying when watching a live show.Also all my favorites and watchlist were saved only had to register the device and all was there.

  I have used Apple TV for many years, but then they altered me that Apple TV will no longer support the YouTube app starting in March, I had to ditch Apple and get something else.  Didn't need anything fancy, and the Fire TV Lite with Alexa remote was the most logical choice at under $30.It was a breeze to set up, add to my WiFi network and everything else was pretty much automatic.  Much easier to use than the old Apple TV I had, with quicker response and better interface as well.  The Alexa enabled remote is great too, even though I don't have Alexa at home (I use Google).  Just tell the remote to go to the app then tell name the movie you want to watch and there it is!Should have switched to this a long time ago.

  I love the Fire stick and this is my second.  But this one is a little glitchy as there are times when I use it in the morning where the volume won't work unless I unplug the power cord from the stick and plug it back in again.  Frustrating, but it works.  I contacted Amazon support about it and they told me to reset it.  I don't think that I should have to reset it every few days.  I don't have to do that on my other one and don't feel that I should have to do it for this one.

  The stick worked fine for about a week.  It’s a little less user friendly than the Roku, but it’s easy enough.  All of a sudden it’s telling us there’s a network connection error.  After going through all the troubleshooting tricks, except resetting our wifi-that’s not going to happen, it was still giving us an error.  Then, about 10 minutes into searching for solutions, it started working again.  I’m not sending it back yet.  I’ll wait to see if it does this again.

  I just contacted Amazon I purchased three for Christmas from my home two out of the three are not working. One stopped working two weeks prior to today’s date and the other one stopped working three weeks prior to today’s date. I was told today that the cut off date was 30 days and it was too late to return I don’t wanna return I just want to exchange. Now they’re telling me I can’t do that either I am not happy! I don’t buy products to have them break down in less than 40 days. Is that why we buy things to replace them every 40 days? Once again I don’t want my money back I just want an exchange for a new one that works. I already had to replace one when I first ordered them because I got sent the wrong parts. Someone who packaged the item did not supply me with everything that went with it. I am not happy with this product!

  Easy to install.  Some apps such as Rumble don't work well.  Voice doesn't always work or understand what you want.  I was sent the promo code for a discount on Hulu to be included with this product on Dec. 20, 2020 and the code didn't work.  I emailed with amazon and was told give them 3 days to correct and send a new code.  Nothing, so sent them and email Jan. 11, 2021 and they replied give them 1-2 days.  Still waiting.  Very poor customer service for this issue.  Spoke to customer service again and they transferred me to Hulu; according to Hulu they do not have any promos with amazon for a discount for 6 months service and the code is invalid.  I've sent a reply to amazon AGAIN and STILL no reply!!!!!!!  Is Amazon now a SCAM?

  Our son got the Amazon Fire Stick for us as a gift.  We have a ""dumb"" TV set.  Now, it's ""smart""!The Fire Stick was pretty easy to install, although we had to remove the wall-hung set to plug in the Firestick's power cord.  Once installed, the setup was pretty easy, and we were watching our first streaming program within an hour.  Since setup we have watched several movies, and one series.  All excellent.However, it's important to know that in order to watch certain programs, you have to pay for the corresponding program upgrades, such as HBO.  Only then can you watch the premium streaming HBO programs.  Still, even without subscribing to any premium services, there is a huge amount of free streaming programming available once the Fire Stick is installed.The sound and image quality are excellent - as good as the direct broadcast cable we watch.The Fire Stick is an excellent way to get streaming on a non-smart TV.  It's an excellent value.

  We were tired of our ""Smart TV"" not having the apps we needed.  We weren't able to add the apps needed either.  So off to the Fire Stick we went.  Has every app that we needed plus so many more.  They stay up to date and add any apps that you may need for your situation.  I have a home theater system, so the Satellite, DVD player, and everything else goes through the sound system first and then only (1) HDMI cable comes out of the sound system to the TV (for whatever video source is playing through the sound system).  So, I decided to plug in the fire stick on an available HDMI input on our sound system, instead of the TV's HDMI input.  It works flawlessly like this as well.  When I want to watch Fire Stick stuff, I just click ""HDMI #3"" on my particular sound system, and then that output goes to the TV.  We chose the ""non-volume control"" model because our sound system has all of that control.  Works great and I highly recommend!

  My ability to stream content was rather limited before I got this. I had a 1st gen Chromecast that was less than useful, and a Blu-ray player that could stream, but it enjoyed crashing and was limited in what it could do with modern streaming platforms.I decided on this streaming stick since it seemed simple, provided a lot of features, was a good price, and worked with a simple USB power interface.It was incredibly simple to install and setup. I think it would be extremely difficult to not make the Fire Stick not work correctly as long as you follow the steps it provides.I found the navigation to be very easy and logical. It was easily to get it working with my various streaming services. The quality of the streaming is excellent.I have yet to encounter a fault or problem. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to do simple multi-service HD streaming.

  We bought this as a replacement to our 1st generation Fire Stick that was just getting to where it wasn’t able to keep up and required cache dumps often just to function and was becoming progressively slower.I know this is a “lite” but it’s functioning power definitely isn’t. It’s amazingly quick and works well with all of our streaming services.Though slightly cumbersome to navigate with the remote the Amazon Silk web browser is also very quick and responsive.We have definitely been happy with this much needed Fire Stick upgrade.Apps we have tried:NetflixHuluDisney+LesMills OnDemandYouTubeSilk BrowserCrunchy rollPrime VideoAll of the above apps have worked seamlessly with this streaming device.Definitely a great investment for any television that does not have built in “smart” capabilities.

  O bought this item as My streaming  Blue Ray DVD player had very few apps it could access in case I wanted Disney+ or something more popular than Hulu and Pandora.  There was also the problem of running an attached wired cable to the back of the Blue Ray DVD  that ran along the floor of my office and constantly being tripped uponThe Firestick was easy to set up and within 15 minutes I was all ready to go and logged into my Prime Steaming service and Netflix .Although I had wanted this product, I also wanted to make myself familiar with the item soI can help some friends who also wish to get a Amazon Firestick They may go with the more expensive HD model but I now have some knowledge of how to set one up when the time comes.Pluses:  A short while after installing the device I get an email with tips and links to use to learn more about it.Cons:  Nothing to tell me how to shut it off.  I had to go online for the answers as I could not find anything in the small foldout instructionsAlexa commands must be exact,  For somne reason the word ""return"" did nothing and I had to instead use ""Home""I woulkd reccommend this item to a friend and I already have

  Every time I turn it on I have to unplug the power and plug it in again to reboot in order to get sound on my tv. I have 5-6 other sticks that function with no problem. This is the only Lite one I have. Poor. Also I hate the new UI.Works ok after rebooting until the next time you use it. So I guess that’s worth some star. I’m going to ditch this one.Update: I was impressed. Within minutes of submitting this review Amazon called. They are gathering info to track down the problem some people are having with audio or video issues. So I upped my rating.

  Alexa? Who needs Alexa? ""She"" misinterprets everything I say.I have a Samsung Smart TV.  I like the features on the Firestick better.I I have Sling TV. Sling works a LOT better on the Firestick than the Samsung.I also have Pluto. They work the same.I have no connection issues, and I like the ability to set the bandwidth, and also the captioning.It's a neat little unit, much easier to navigate than the Samsung TV,and works very well with my network setup.For what I paid, I'm extremely happy!If you can grab ""Firestick Downloader"", you can add THOUSANDS of channels, from all over the world.As it stands now, with Sling (Hollywood and Starz options), and a couple of free ""sideloads"", I have more TV than I can handle.  And I am a TV freak.Sure comes in handy in times like these. You can find something for everyone.Enjoy!

  Whoa.Firstly,  I am an Amazon/Alexa/Firestick fan. I have had MULTIPLE firesticks in the past 5 years, mostly due to adding TVs and needing the portability for summer camps etc.Secondly,  this is BY FAR the easiest setup of a firestick!! Holy Cow! Because I had a Firestick in the living room,  it recognized it, connected to the wifi (um....Without having to enter the $##@%% password) and used the other Firestick to add apps etc. A much loved (on my part) feature.Cons? Well. I knew what I was buying (this is stick #6 or 7),so no surprises qith the base features. However (and I'm not sure this is merely a ""lite"" feature) the Home screen has changed. No biggie, just an acclimation necessary.As for the ""no tv controls""....that was never an issue.My only [ONLY] issue? The extra tv button on the remote....I am such a creature of habit with muscle memory for remote controls...so I keep hitting the tv button when I mean to play/pause. Seriously,  thats a user thing, I shall adapt!All in all...if you have multiple Firesticks (like me), you plug it in, accept the cloning of the other settings and.....Bob's your uncle.Its the simple things!!

  After two weeks of use, it began to fail over a period of three days.  When I tried moving ports, restarting the TV, restarting the Fire Stick, etc. it would not boot up.  It was quite obviously dead.  I had heard how easy it is to return items to Amazon.  Not this item.It was very confusing to the very patient support person that *I* bought this, but someone *else* registered the device - my wife.  After 31 minutes on the phone, he agreed to send a new one.  Which works fine.  So far.  But I was instructed to send the defective item back, for refurbishment or quality control purposes.  When the replacement item came, I did not find a return envelope or an address label.A few days later, I asked my wife if she had seen the return label.  She had not, so I tried to get one without the hassle of the phone.  I gave up on that and called Support.  They called right back, were also (patiently) confused by the user not being the same as the buyer, and after 23 minutes, agreed to send (or re-send) the return label.  To the user, not the purchaser.  Tomorrow, the dead one goes back.So if *you* buy it, make sure *you* register it.  Perhaps the more expensive version of the Stick is also more robust.

  What have I been doing without this Fire Stick? I cannot believe that I didn't get this sooner. This is the best invention since sliced bread. It works with my cheap TV and I don't need an expensive TV in order to get quality movies and shows. This thing works like a charm. I cannot believe how impressive it is and especially at this price point. $22.00 with a remote and Alexa? Come on. I ordered another one right after setting up the first one. If you're considering purchasing it, don't hesitate. Get it. All the apps in one place at my fingertips. I like my Chromecast too, but the difference is your cell phone is your remote for Chromecast and for Fire stick they come with a personalized remote.

  I have 5 of these, one of them I lost the remote.  Think I left it up at Whistler.  Although your phone works fine as a remote with the Fire TV Stick App.  You can reprogram a remote to a different stick by holding down the Home Key for a few seconds.  Anyway, I don’t have any smart TV’s but I love how easy the TV fire stick makes the TV smart.  I can view all my cameras one at a time by just pushing the microphone button and saying, “Show Driveway Camera,” etc.  It will also work with on the TV with an Alexa device.  It does everything I need and I can project YouTube etc out of my Ipad through the Firestick onto the TV screen.  There are so many ways you can use this stick it is mind boggling.

  This is my first Amazon streaming device and I would say I'm decently satisfied with it... I had a Roku stick that I used for my living room TV and was planning on buying another to put in my bedroom but my work ended up giving me an Amazon fire TV stick lite as a Christmas gift. So I moved my Roku stick to my bedroom TV and set up the fire stick in my living room since it was newer. The design and set up of it is obviously different than my Roku but it's still easy to figure out and I like some of the features like the ""Find"" function that lets you search for free movies and shows. One downside is that I don't have an Alexa device so that's a whole function of it that I don't use. The only other downsides I've found is that you have to actually ""turn on"" the fire stick after your turn on your TV which is a very minor thing but something that I had to adjust to with switching from a Roku stick. I also have a problem with using Amazon prime video on it because I don't have prime.... I use a family members prime account which was what I was logged into on my Roku, but since I set up the Fire stick with my Amazon account I don't have access to prime.... Other than that, it's a really nice streaming device and I do really like the voice recognition function. I might have to buy an Alexa just so I can hook that up to it as well... Thank you work for the amazing Christmas present.

  I had a 2017 fire stick that has slowed down continuously over the years, and decided to buy an updated one for our downstairs TV. Typically we use an Xbox One for streaming services, but Microsoft does not have a CNN app and I very specifically wanted a CNN app that I could log into with a cable provider.Unfortunately, the CNN go app for the fire stick will not launch no matter what I do. Clear cache, clear data, restart, etc. I’m 23 and very handy with technology and cannot make it work.This device is excellent in most ways: extraordinarily easy to set up, alexa controls are way improved from my old fire TV stick, and I love that you can search across platforms unlike Roku. Unfortunately, it seems like a number of the streaming apps that aren’t the “bigger streaming services” are underdeveloped and are either quite buggy or don’t work altogether. If you’re looking to stream mostly apps like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube, you should be in the clear.

  The firestivk lite runs just as well as the firestick 4K , while it does not have tv controls or 4K capability , the apps run just as well as they do on the more expensive Firestick . I do not think that most users will be able to tell the difference in the Firestick lite and the more expensive Firestick 4K .  The same cpu is used in both . If you do not need t.v. on-off and tv volume controls on your firestick ,then save yourself some money and go with the Firestick Lite .

  The device I received work initially when I set it up. However, about a week or so later it was no longer connected to my account and I couldn’t get it reconnected. I called costumer assistance and after about 45 min they told me that for some unknown reason my device had the same serial number as another device. This second device was reported lost and so my device was now no longer functional. No one at Amazon could tell me how there were duplicate serial numbers on two devices or if there were not other devices out there which also had duplicate serial numbers. Beware!!!

  Since we both wanted Disney+ (big kids at heart) the only way we could get it was to purchase a Fire Stick. It's relatively easy to use, love the Alexa integration. HOWEVER, we thought our first First Stick purchase was defective, so we ordered a second - and thought that, too, was defective (the 'menu' button didn't work). After calling Amazon (yeah, I know - should have done that in the beginning), we were told that the menu button wasn't functional for us - we would have to 'upgrade' for it to work. Okay, now we know. Still, it's nice to have the voice activation feature. Even though we don't have the menu feature, I would still recommend it for owners of 'older' smart tvs.

Have to turn off and back on in the middle of live broadcasts ... and to think I was stupid enough to order another one ... will see how this works ...if it doesn't work any better  I will definitly go back to Roku

  The product isn’t all bad; it isn’t all good either. I firstly did my research, prior to purchasing. Everything I saw or read made the claim that the only differences between the Lite and Standard fire sticks were found in the remotes and something having to do with Dolby audio settings (not important to me). That turned out to NOT be entirely true. Although slight, the Home page looks different. The panels are set up differently than what we’ve grown accustomed to expect from previous fire sticks. However, they’ve maintained the user-friendliness of the device, making the learning curve manageable. Also, the device has maintained the ability to side load apps from unknown sources. However, although everything works as expected, a couple of the apps fail to display the panel art and therefore remain blank in appearance. To me, these slight variances aren’t much of a big deal. However, if you’re like I am, you appreciate knowing the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, prior to purchasing any product. In my opinion, Amazon fell a bit short, this time, in doing that. Besides the aforementioned, the product serves my purposes. It gets the job done but depending on your personal preferences, you may want to stick to what’s familiar. Besides the lower price, the Lite appears to be void of any advantage over the Standard fire stick we’ve all grown to love.

  I am so glad I bought this. It was very easy to set up. It almost seemed easier than the more expensive models. I have the 4k model from 2019.  It is very fast and a lot less buffering. It seems to work better than my 4k model.  I bought this so I'd be able to stream HBO Max on a non-smart tv that I already had a Roku stick on. I didn't need the option to control the tv because I can do that with the Roku remote so this was a very good option. I'd buy again.

  I owned a previous-generation Roku and needed to add a couple more as we moved from cable to streaming via SlingTV.  I was skeptical of the stick, thinking it would be slow and limited.  But I've had these now for almost a year and they are great.  This is the 2017 version of the Roku Streaming Stick (the + indicates it supports 4K video.)  It's a good device, and this and its non + twin both feature a wonderful remote control that can turn your TV off or on -- and adjust the volume.  This means that most of the time you'll only need one remote control -- a great feature.  You also get voice commands.If you haven't used streaming video before, you may be confused by the options such as Roku, Amazon's Fire, Google's Chromecast and Android TV, and Apple TV.  You choose a device and then there are available apps for various pay- and free streaming services.  Services such as SlingTV, youtube TV, Direct TV Now, Hulu Live, and Playstation Vue all provide selections of cable and broadcast channels live -- basically cable without the cable.  There are literally hundreds of other free services on Roku, with wide ranges of content AND quality.Having used this product for the better part of a year, I can easily recommend it, unless you need a hard-wired solution such as the Roku Ultra.

  WILL NOT WORK ON A LOT OF OLDER TV'S.  Will connect to WIFI internet but won't go any further to download application.ONLY ""support"" is on-line---NO WAY TO CONTACT ROKU BY TELEPHONE.I also have a basic Roku streaming device that came with my SLING subscription.  Keeps dropping my internet connection (only about 25 ft from my WIFI router) which requires a device ""re-set"".  The re-set is VERY DIFFICULT as my TV is wall mounted requiring a step-stool to reach as the device is connected on the top rear of the TV,  and the re-set button is quite tiny.My suggestion is:  DO NOT BUY ANY ROKU PRODUCTS!!!!!!

  I purchased this unit solely on the promise of long range wifi.  I have been using a 4k Firestick which has a less than stellar wifi range.  I have the 2 hooked up side by side in hdmi 2 and 3.  There is absolutely no difference in wifi connectivity range between the two.  Tech support from Amazon and Roku are handled by folks in the Philippines.  While they are all very polite and try hard, they are very little help do to language barriers and the fact that they don't actually know much of what they're talking about.  They simply lookup questions on the computer and give canned answers.  They don't know enough about the product they're supporting to actually think logically about their answers.  That is just such an incredible disservice to their customers.  After using the Firestick for several months I found using the Roku kind of clunky.  The Firestick reacts more quickly when you make channel selections and switching wifi networks like I need to do from time to time takes fewer commands with the Firestick.  When using the Roku and watching multiple episodes of a series, it will sometimes freeze right when the new episode is about to play.  I then am forced to press the home button and go back into it again.  This never happens with the Firestick.  Maybe the Roku is just defective but Tech Support being as described was no help in determining this.  If the wifi range was as good as advertised then I could deal with the other issues but since it isn't in this case, I'll be returning the unit.  At least Amazon makes that part very easy.

  Overall, this is a very nice streaming system. The setup is pretty easy, although not nearly as quick and easy as the Fire TV since you have to register an account on Roku and give them a credit card (it is not charged unless you buy something).I have it connected to an AV receiver and it's working great in terms of both picture and sound. The stick is slim enough to plug into an HDMI port on the back of the receiver without blocking anything.  Wireless speed and connectivity is excellent.What I don't like:1. The four one-click buttons on the remote for Netflix, etc. can't be re-programmed. While the Netflix button is great since I have that service, the other 3 are useless. It would have been great to be able to reprogram them to work with an app of my choice.2. The power and volume controls do NOT work with an AV receiver, only a TV. Since I have the stick plugged into my receiver, neither button is functional. Disappointing.I also have a Fire TV box attached to the system. In comparison, the Roku menus are pretty dated looking as is the overall navigation. The remote is more clunky and doesn't respond as quickly at times. But, the Roku has apps that the Fire TV does not, so having both gives me more choices.

  Bought a few of these and really wish I hadn’t in the end.  They work but lack a lot compared to a fire stick.  The Firestick is android based and will allow you to do a lot more with a side load capability.  Roku doesn’t even have a browser that be loaded so you limited only to the available apps that you can download through Roku.  Now that Firestick has volume and TV control there’s really no reason to use a Roku compared to Firestick.  I’m in the process of getting rid of all these Roku devices.  Additionally something they don’t mention is that they frequently stop working due to heat.  They will send you and extension if requested to try and get the device away from the TV and give it some air flow but that doesn’t alway work.

  Laggy equipment - I expected this to be more responsive.  I hate any sort of lag and this was noticeable to me.Remote doesn’t work all the time.  Started after the 30 day amazon return.  This is my biggest beef.I like it better than the fire, but I HATED the fire interface.My new tv has a faster os and the same interface as the roku... so I no longer use this.I switched over because my roku also wasn’t showing 4K content when I upgraded my tv.  I don’t know if I needed to tweak a setting or not but it wasn’t automatic.One good thing... YouTube didn’t have commercials.  That could bring me back to the roku as the tv does have commercials for YouTube, but I’d only use it for you tube content.

  I have owned several Roku streaming devices during the past and have never had any issues with the devices.  However, the Streaming Stick+ is a different story.  Very often, the stick freezes up and is totally unresponsive.  The only way I have found to get it working again is to unplug it and wait 60 seconds.  I contacted customer support via Chat and the representative was of no help.  He told me he would send troubleshooting steps to correct the problem via my email but I never received them.  I then called customer service's phone number and waited almost an hour but was never able to speak with a representative.  I was unable to find any troubleshooting solutions to this problem on line.  If this is the best Roku can do, I'm switching to Fire Stick.Update:  After communicating with Roku's Technical Support via emails for two weeks, I still have not resolved the problem with my Streaming Stick+.  It still freezes up several times a day and I have to unplug it for 60 seconds and then restore power to reboot.  Even then, it does not always work and I must reboot several more times to get it going again.  Customer Service is TERRIBLE.  It appears that the Tech may be overseas and using a language program to translate based on the tech's poor grammar and misspelled words.  Also, you can forget about the one year warranty!  They are quick to blame the problem on everything except their device and will not consider replacing the device.  My advice is to avoid purchasing the Roku Streaming Stick+.

  We bought this on Prime day to replace an old Roku. It freezes, buffers, crashes and shows so many errors.... it's unusable. We are returning. The old Roku from 4 years ago works much better than this one. Very disappointed and would not recommend it. We restarted, reset, tried everything. No avail.Upon researching, many others have these issues (i.e. open up Netflix and it plays for 2 minutes, then buffers for 5 minutes, plays for 3 seconds, buffers for 5 minutes......). It's a glitch with this device.

  This thing is junk, spend your money on anything else.What sucks you might ask:Roku will make you create an account and provide a CC just to use your device.Roku will add you to their SPAM lists and their unsubscribe is non-functional - Violating the 2003 CAN-SPAM actThe included power cord and ""extension"" is a joke, be prepared to buy a USB extension to plug this in.The remote, with brand new batteries, barely works.  Be prepared to walk around the side of the TV to get the remote to work.Even with a reported ""Excellent"" Wi-Fi signal (AC - 1400 15 feet away) it will still have dropoutsApparently, you can't turn it off.You have to use another device to add ""channels"" (you can add some, but not all, from the device itself).Like I said, buy anything else.  I'm going to stick with the Nvidia shields that I have on the other TV's (highly recommended) and put this junk on the guest room tv (or in the trash).If you don't want to spend the loot for the shield, which is far superior to Apple 4K and Dune 4K, maybe try the Amazon stick - I don't have one of those but it's unlikely to be worse, or anywhere near as awful as this.  I suspect anyone who recommends this crap has never used anything else.1 star is too much.

  I tried Amazon Fire's new model, and several others.  This is the one to buy!  Super easy setup.  Best of the Best as far as the user interface goes.  Adding new apps/channels is a breeze and they support nearly everything, including my DS Video from Synology for accessing my NAS.  Also, if you have a USB port on your TV, then you don't need a power adapter at all, just plug it into the HDMI for your video input and Pigtail the included USB cable into the USB port on your TV and i that will power the device.  Very feature rich and in my opinion, the best streaming device on the market.  Roku has come a LONG way since they started. Stop looking further and buy this today!

  I have one of these Streaming Stick + that works. It’s stays “on” all the time; it is powered on all the time.I bought a second one and the tv powers the USB port off when it turns off.The batteries die in the remote in about 5-6 days. I have been through 5 or 6 pairs of batteries in a couple of months. It’s awful.Roku support is unhelpful. They followed up twice with a long questionnaire about the issue but they don’t follow up any more after this, and I answered their questions in detail.I have had made 4 attempts through chat and email to resolve the issue, and have now given up. And I never leave bad reviews. Others should be warned about this situation, though.Roku told me to keep the device plugged in, basically, and never responded again even though I have reached out three more times.IMHO they don’t have an answer and blew me off.The issue is documented on a Reddit thread I found so there are others with this issue even though Roku denies it.I believe other units will work in this situation (needing the roku to be powered off when not in use), so you can get other Rokus. Skip the streaming Stick + with the voice remote. It’s not good unless you want to use your phone as a remote or love buying or recharging batteries every week!

  When this was <$20 on sale, it's a great deal. Otherwise, it's just ""Meh"" with compeition being good options. The reason I say this is for tow reasons: 1st, the included remotes are not great and 2nd, it's just buggy. I'd be willing to pay more to get an alumum clad remote that has better feel, something more like what comes with Apple TV.  As far as ""buggy"", it constantly drops sound and get's glitchy. No matter the software update, we're lucky to get through a week without having to unplug the power to it and do a clean reboot.  Sometimes it's nearly every day. My kids use Prime a lot and I'm constantly having to intervene to make it work right is annoying.

  WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU AGREE TO PAY $80-100 OVER THE COST OF THE STREAMING DEVICE ($50)..THEY TELL ME THEY WON'T ACTIVATE IT....WHAT THE ?????THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ADVISED ME TO THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE AND THEN HUNG UP ON ME.  ROKU THINKS THAT LITTLE OF ITS PRODUCT AND ITS CUSTOMERS.....WOW!!!!!

  Great little gadget; I've been using Roku for many years.  I was blown away, though, when I bought this device, plugged it in, got ready to retire all my other remotes, only to learn there's no mute button on this remote.  There are mute bottons on other Roku remotes I own - but not the 4K stick model.  I had to buy a SideClick (with programmable buttons) to resolve the problem.  Also - the voice recognition?  Doesn't work inside other apps, which is really too bad. Finally - to avoid the very slow boot time, don't plug your stick into the USB port on your TV.  Plug it into the wall, and you won't have to wait for the reboot (TV's often power down the USB ports when you turn them off).April 29 2019 Update:  I've been using this device for several weeks, and have a growing list of gripes:  Powering up the TV with the power button this the remote doesn't always work.  It's not just ""press the button"".  It's ""PRESS THE BUTTON A VERY CERTAIN WAY"".  Lots of casual users (visitors & guests) struggle with this.  The stick needs regular rebooting.  It crashes..... ALOT.  The power plug (USB-B) isn't tight, and making matters worse, is on the bottom side of the stick when plugged into my LG HDMI port.  Fixed with electrical tape - but when the device needs to be physically rebooted (which is turning out to be about 2-3 times per week) this has become an unacceptable problem.I'm going to contact Roku and ask for either a replacement or an upgrade.  This is not an acceptable user experience.

  I've been a Roku user for years,including several different models. Roku has recently released The Roku Channel,which has hundreds of free movies.It is ad supported.And now Locast app gives you free local broadcast stations CBS,NBC,FOX,ABC and PBS.Locast now offers local TV network broadcasts for New York,Boston,Chicago,Houston,Dallas,Denver areas and plans to add many more cities.This means many folks will no longer need antennas to watch local networks for free. Roku has just about every app you can imagine (YouTube/Pandora/Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/HBO Now) and thousands of more apps in many different categories.This Roku Streaming Stick PLUS does have more advanced WiFi antenna than the regular Streaming Stick.Here are some points to consider when deciding on which model of Roku to buy:1)If you need to connect by WiFi in a room far away from your WiFi router,I would recommend the Roku Streaming Stick PLUS or Roku Ultra.2)If you have a 4K TV,I would recommend the Roku Ultra or Roku Streaming Stick PLUS.The Premiere 2018 model also plays 4K.3)To search for content using your voice,go with either the Streaming Stick,Streaming Stick PLUS or Ultra.All 3 of these models also have a remote that can control the power and volume on a TV.There is also a Roku app for Android & iPhone/iPad that lets you use your smartphone/tablet to control any Roku device and use your phone/tablet on-screen keyboard for searches.4)If you want a wired ethernet connection,go with the Roku Ultra.5)If you want to connect to an old TV with RCA/Composite audio/video jacks,you will need the Express PLUS6)The Express & Premiere 2018 models have a remote where it has to be pointed at the device,unlike the other Roku models.7)If you are only going to buy one Roku device,I would recommend the Roku Ultra.The Ultra has many unique features that the other Roku models don't such as:-Gaming buttons to play video games-Remote finder to find a lost remote control-Ethernet port for a wired connection-Micro SD card slot-USB Port-Night listening mode (this lowers the volume of loud,explosive sounds and raises the volume of soft sounds like whispers.Very useful!)-Headphone jack on the remote for listening without disturbing othersBottom Line:You can now get a Roku device to replace your cable TV box & service or to replace an antenna for free local network TV.And of course you can create your own custom TV experience that simply is not possible with cable or antenna TV.

  Since I work for Amazon, I won a Fire Stick a few years ago.  I was very disappointed in the performance, and when it fried, I picked up this Roku stick, and I'm happy I did.  The options and menu worked fantastically, the buffering was reduced tremendously, and the interface was fantastic.That was just over a year ago.  So a few months ago, the remote continuously drained the batteries to corpses overnight every time we didn't take the batteries out (which we shouldn't have to do . . .).  So of course things got worse.  Yesterday I was watching something and friends dropped off something for me, so I hit pause, and when I came back several minutes later, realized that the play function was not working, so I went through the several annoying steps to re-pair the remote and once it was, hit rewind, then play.  The rewind worked, the play and pause and stop -- literally 1/2 second later -- did not.  The show rewound to the beginning.I re-paired it again and even went to the online manual, tried everything, forwarded to the point where my show was initially paused, then the play wouldn't work.  It went all the way to the end and to the next episode, so once again I had to unplug the USB power to the device and re-pair.  This activity has been happening, worse and worse, for over a week.So I checked the order, it's out of support.  I am buying it again and this time getting the danged 3-year extended warranty for less than 5 bucks.Great item, mine died fast, so get it with a warranty.Peace.

  Interested in ""cutting the cord"", I researched the best streaming devices, and found that the Roku Streaming Stick+ was consistently in the top 5 and was the best value for the money for our particular family.  I was able to choose same-day delivery, and received them in the late afternoon.  They were contained in a larger box, so no one could see what was in the package, and the delivery person thoughtfully put them behind a half-wall in our entry court, rather than right in front of the door where they could be seen from the street, which I appreciated!When removed from the box, the items were just as described, in unopened, original packaging.  The quick start guide takes you step-by-step through attaching the Roku to your TV and syncing it to the remote, and from that point on, you simply follow the on-screen directions as it walks you through setting up your Roku account (free - but keep in mind that you will need a laptop, desk computer, or phone present in order to access the Roku website to do this), linking your device to it, and starting to use it.  It was easy to add the streaming services we already had, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, and interesting to browse the many free options available and add the ones we wanted - the Western TV & Movie Classics"" channel is a big hit with my husband and his dad.  Once set up, there are links on the home page to a ""Getting Started"" with Roku page, and a ""Tips and Tricks"" to Using Roku page for more information regarding your Roku, in addition to tiles for whatever channels you chose during your set-up.We have been using these (we installed two in our home, and one in my 90-year-old father-in-law's home) for a month now, and have had no issues whatsoever.  We have not had any problems with lag, and pictures are clear and bright (any fuzziness in the photos I've provided are the fault of the camera operator!).  The user interface is pretty standard for this type of thing - the biggest learning curve we faced was figuring out exactly which apps the shows we normally watched were on.  However, between being able to customize which streaming apps appear on your home page, and the two ways to search - you can either type in the name in the search bar, or you can hold down a microphone-iconed button on the remote and, for example, say ""Search Criminal Minds"", it is fairly easy to get to where you want to be without having to flounder around in the interface.  Even dad-in-law, who is somewhat electronically challenged, got the hang of it fairly quickly, and is very comfortable with using the interface at this point.  We are all very happy with the device and service.  Highly recommended!NOTE: Regarding the stick being at the side of the TV  in our photo, in case anyone is concerned about the aesthetics of having this sticking out of your TV - there were other HDMI ports we could have used at the back of the TV, where the stick would have been hidden and only the Roku power cord coming down next to the TV power cord would have been visible.  However, these were difficult for me to reach, and since my husband is not very technologically savvy, I am the one who usually deals with the electronics and troubleshoots when there are problems, so I was more concerned with the device being easily accessible that I was about how it looked.  Rest assured, if you want a neater look, it is certainly available if you choose to use an HDMI port at the back of your TV.  :- )

  Bought this back in October 2020. It drains remote control batteries in 2 weeks or less. Several online “chats” with Roku support yielded a replacement remote that suffered the same fate.  Given all of the time consumed trying to troubleshoot this through multiple chat sessions and money spent on batteries, I asked them to replace the entire unit and they refused. I will be tossing this in the garbage and switching to a Fire Stick or TiVo Streaming device. Stay away from Roku. Poor products and poor customer service.

  I bought a total of 7 of these sticks to use between our home and our condo  later summer/early fall of 2019.  The sticks are now about 7 months old, but any particular stick will have only been used for a maximum of 4 months.  While initially pleased with the purchase, recent issues have changed my thoughts.  I am now very concerned with long term longevity with these units.  Of the 7, I now have pretty serious issues with 2 sticks.  One has intermittent wifi connection issues that essentially began over nite.  I've moved it around, rebooted, changed feeds, rebooted the router and wifi all to no avail.  The second stick seems to have a problem with the HDMI plug on the stick itself.  I started seeing some kind of copy protection warnings the requires a repower to clear.  Both sticks are in our condo and have been used for roughly 4 months.  To top it off, the 3rd condo stick is also now beginning to act it little odd while booting up - strange screen messages, etc.  Again, a reboot seems to clear things out.  I contacted Roku customer service and am getting a bit of run around.  Before you buy this, be aware that there seems to be hardware issues that will arise.

  I bought this for my brother and when he tried to set it up a phone number flashed on the screen to call and when he called some guy in India wanted him to pay $200 to activate his account.  THIS IS A SCAM!  i don't know how the scammer got involved with this Roku device, he probably supplied it to the Amazon seller at a discount if he would add the scam, but NEVER pay anything for Roku, it's always absolutely free!  I have no problem with the Roku device they work great, but I'm giving it one star because the seller somehow sold a scam with the device.

  I choosen the lite version because I needed to connect it to a projector and audio via blutooth to a receiver in another room.  Nice interface, blutooth connected 90% of the time, but I was very deceived that this system does not control its own output volume.  One thing is being able to do it via IR to your tv, and other is controlling the output on the same device.  with this flaw, this item is restricted to be used in the same room with tv and receiver.  According to what I`m researching, more advanced fire tv has volume controls, but only via IR too.  Additional software can be added to control output volume, but you can not link it to your fire tv remote.

  I bought this Fire TV stick with Alexa voice control for my parents who are in their late 60’s and not tech savvy. It is very user friendly. The voice recognition is very convenient especially when they know exactly what they want to watch. The smart features are easy to navigate and they were sitting on the couch using it with ease within minutes.The setup itself was simple. I just plugged it in downloaded all apps like Disney +, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, etc and logged in.Now all the grandkids can have synced watch parties with their grandparents (since sleep overs are canceled right now) and everyone is once again laughing/talking/joking happily together during movie nights with Nonie & Popie.

  My favorite feature is being able to search for titles across streaming services. My second favorite is Alexa voice search. Typing on the on screen keyboard is a huge pain. Voice command is very accurate and easy. I also like that you have to push a button on the remote to invoke Alexa. I do not like having Alexa listening to everything.The streaming quality is significantly better than the default that comes through our Samsung tv.I bought a second FireStick for my bicycle training because Zwift runs on FireStick but it does not run on Android TV.I will recommend considering whether a tv has FireStick built in when buying my next tv.

  This digital antenna is the best I've ever purchased.  Excellent quality and easy to install but need to gave an HD TV to install port.  Extra long cable making it easy to move around for best reception.  Best place us up high on window itself.  Gives you 200 mile radius switching from short to long distance radius.  Incredible clarity.  Just move cable cord as needed if pix begins to scramble.  Pulls in most local stations, 2, 4,5,7,9,11?,13,21,25, and many more.  Take note each main channel gives you additional sub-channels within that channel so you're getting even more stations.  Worth every penny then paying those high cable bills.  Terrific price for quality assurance and more.

  I had to replace my original firestick that was about 4 years old, because it kept overheating and one day everything just froze!  I received the new ""lite"" version today and set up was easy.  The only difficulty I had was getting the battery cover off the remote, but after continuous trying, it just suddenly popped off!  I found everything I expected and the bonus is the Alexa voice option.  I'm a happy camper now!

  When I moved into this house, the internet was through DSL. I didn't think it would have sufficient bandwidth for streaming so I bought dumb TVs. Since then we've got fiber optic so I got Firestick to access digital stuff.I had one of the early Firesticks on one TV and a newer one on the other. I noticed the newer one seemed much faster so I replaced the old one. I was right--the new ones are faster.

  I have the original FireTV (2014) and like it a lot. I saw this, for under $20.00 (sale), and like Fry yelled, ""Shut Up And Take My Money!"". This is a good version for a secondary TV (bedroom, playroom, etc...). The functions are easy to understand and adding apps or services are simple. The only reason I recommend this for secondary TVs is this unit/interface is notably slower than my original FireTV. Some button clicks take ""a while"" to react. Other than the lower CPU power, this plays content largely without issue (few buffering prompts) and sound is crisp and clear. I'm liking this little guy (don't miss/need the ""tv controls"") and can easily recommend.

  Bought this on Black Friday, wrapped it up so “Santa” could gift it to my wife and I. After Christmas, I plugged it up- set everything up and kept getting this error. Called support and talked for over a hour, doing troubleshooting- the result was a defective device. She overnighted me a replacement, got it a couple of days later. Thought all was good, got everything set back. Same errors. Sat on phone again, Trouble shooting. They couldn’t get it to work. End result, 10$ off a new stick. Obviously, was not happy about that, so I asked for a supervisor. She is sending a second replacement. She explained that if this second (or third stick) does not work, to let them know and they would come up with a resolution.

  Overall, a great streaming device, but that said, never tried Roku/Apple TV/ChromecastWould be great if this could in the future pull broadcast local stations if your TV has an antenna attached - and would appreciate airplay support - we love the Amazon smart ecosystem, but are also iPhone users - also would be great to remove options to rent & buy titles or at least separate into another sub menu - was hard to find what stuff was included with prime so canceled primeUpdate 3/19/2021 - have used for a few months now and have noticed multiple issues which were never present in the second generation firestick - at times will freeze and/or lose audio and need to reboot the stick (never had that issue in the past) - also certain apps will not play (paramount plus) or show will keep playing a loop (hulu) - when going to other tv (samsung smart with built in apps) paramount plus and hulu cannot replicate the issue

  So disappointed. I have the static/snow bug.  Hooked up the new stick today and every five minutes the screen goes to snow, you can still hear sound and it will stay that way for a little while and then the picture will come back.  If you unplug the HDMI and plug it back in it will bring back the picture. To troubleshoot I plugged in my old Roku 3 and it has been playing for two hours now on YouTube TV without any issues, changed nothing except for the devices. Update:  Roku did respond to me on Twitter. The problem for me appears to be that the new devices do not work through either an HDMI splitter or my particular Samsung receiver. Plugged directly into my TVs they work. In the room where I have a projector I have multiple devices and I need a splitter so I will use the older Roku three. Kind of lousy that the $35 fire stick works with the splitter and receiver no problem but not the Roku streaming stick plus with newer and supposedly more advanced technology-but at least I got everything working.  They seem to work pretty well now that I can actually use them, but big negative that I have to use older tech with my projector because of the snow bug.

  Solution/Work around.I  have a ROKU Stick+ on an LG 49UH6030. The LG software 05.30.90 is up to date.This LG TV  does not handle Amazon Prime HDR properly.  The images are way too dark and no settings tweaking makes them acceptable.   The LG TV displays Disney+ and Apple TV HDR content just fine, so the problem is probably with the Prime Video app.This problem is apparent on Prime Video via HDMI as well as on the Prime Video app installed on the LG OS.  My specific test video is the Amazon-produced Chi-Raq by Spike Lee.  I used a DVD of the same content on my upscaling Sony BD player as a control and the DVD disc displayed properly and far better than the 4K HDR streaming on this TV.ROKU reports that the LG TV HDMI port is 4K, HDR, 60 Hz, HDCP 2.2 via the auto-detect in ROKU/Settings/Display_Type.My solution is to choose the 4K, 60 Hz setting without HDR.  Now 4K videos that were detected by the TV as having HDR play properly. The LG TV has HDR-effect display settings for non-HDR items to compensate.This LG-TV/Prime Video HDR issue does not appear to be exclusive to the ROKU Stick+ but ROKU's settings flexibility provided the work around that was needed for this TV.

  Let me say that I have 2 other Roku's that are fantastic and have never had any issues with them.  Bought a new TV in July and was excited about the fact that Roku makes this stick that can handle 4K and HDR.  Over the past 5 months my excitement has faded.  I, like several others, get the HDCP warning on a regular basis and the worst part is that it happens when I'm trying to load non-4K apps.  After calling Roku customer service in November they sent me an HDMI extender, which did absolutely nothing.  Recently there is a new issue...the remote keeps un-pairing from the Roku.  Customer service has finally agreed to replace it since it's still under warranty but I must pay shipping to return the defective one to them.  The two stars applies to the device and their customer service.UPDATE 6/5/19 - downgraded to one star due to the fact that the replacement Roku is just as bad as the original.  It also has a whole new set of issues including constantly losing connection with my network, unpairing from the remote which doesn't work half the time, audio issues, and failing for no apparent reason...and once in bright red letters on the screen was a message saying the Roku was overheating...unplug it!  I have come to know not to wait until the show I want to watch is starting because it can take up to 20 minutes of restarting/repairing to get the thing to work.  I'll be throwing this out & replacing with something else.  It's junk & I do not want to deal with Roku ""customer service"" again.

  We've had an older Roku for over 10 years and it was fine for the most part. A few years ago we bought a Roku TV so this device went in the basement for that older TV. Until recently, we haven't spent much time in the basement but lately the wife has gotten hooked on an app with free movies when she was in the basement exercising. She was starting to grumble about the picture freezing occasionally. I then checked the available Rokus to see if there was any that would work better. This one, in the description, mentioned for basements so I decided for the price, it might be worth a try. What a difference! With this stick there is no more freezing or buffering. My wife is happy and you know what they say, a happy wife is a happy life. I found the set up easy enough. Since I already had a Roku account, once I logged in, all my apps preloaded. Well worth the money.

  Before I begin, let me say that I have 1GB internet speed package, and that when I experienced issues with this device, I had our internet provider come out and test all the lines in the house, going to and coming from the house, and test the download and upload speeds.  Everything checked out. I also installed the Speedtest app on this device and confirmed that my speeds were plenty fast enought (avg 40-60 during peak hours) for streaming tv. If you stream movies, it works with no issues. But if you intend to watch live football, or any other live tv event, it buffered constantly. We experienced this on Hulu and DirecTvNow, during peak hours and off hours and across multiple channels like CBS, ABC, ESPN, and Fox AND plugged in via ethernet (side note - I've read that most devices including this one and the Fire stick are not capable of anything more than 10/100 even with ethernet so having 1GB speeds was a mute point). We tried everything and I mean everything, including buying a different Roku (Ultra), changing router settings, ethernet vs wi-fi, etc and had the same issues no matter what. Out of desperation, I ordered a Fire  TV Stick (v2) and have experienced buffering only twice, for fraction of a second. All I know is this doesn't work and the Fire TV stick does for live tv.

  This is my second Roku.  The first one came with a service I purchased and quit working after 3 months.  I kept seeing the great reviews and got a good price, so decided to try it again.  What a mistake!  At first, I couldn't get any channels because it was confusing my new device with the old one that was FOUR YEARS OLD!  They told me I would have to use a different email account to set up the device.  After about 30 minutes of telling them this was ridiculous, I will just return it, they finally got a supervisor to intervene to fix my account.  Bad luck on my end, because I should have just returned it.  About four days ago, all my channels just randomly disappeared except for Netflix.  I can't add any channels either through the device or on my computer.  Tech support said they would contact me but it has been four days and nothing.  Going back to using the Firestick.  See photo above for the dead link you get after you select the product to get customer support.  Do you see a way to proceed?  Neither do I.

  The unit seems to be fine. This is the second round unit we've purchased.  We hooked it up in our bedroom.  But we can't stream  our it through it. Apparently there's a bit of a conflict between Roku and spectrum.  As of December 15th 2020... you cannot stream Your Spectrum through your Roku.  You can have other streaming.  Disney plus, Netflix,  Hulu, video and others. We have do have our spectrum through our previous Roku. But. For now. If you purchase a new Roku? And you are a spectrum customer? You will not be able to stream through Roku. I sure hope they fix this issue soon...

  WAY TOO MUCH back and forth from computer to tv and back. Registration is obtuse. Would not allow registration to complete unless I added CC. I do NOT make purchases, so this is useless and just another way for ROKU to intrusively capture your information. Also added channels I did NOT want: DISNEY, HULU, HBO, SHOWTIME, etc.The only reason I purchased was for viewing YouTube. That's it. I have been using a Samsung DVD/BluRay device, the the YouTube performance was VERY BAD. Continuously stalls for YouTube but works good for NF and AP. This device works VERY well for YT, but the setup is a turn off. The juice is just not worth the squeeze. If I had it to do again, I would not buy this.One more thing... the extender cable I needed had to be ordered thru Roku. BACK ORDERED for ONE FULL MONTH. I went out and purchased one retail. Another poor selling point. For the price, it should be included. ROKU is just ""Cheaping Out"".Do Not Buy... or do so at your own peril.UPDATE: The EXTENDER CABLE is NOT A CABLE, BUT A CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP ""dongle"" appx 3 inches long. AND IT DOES NOT, I REPEAT, IT DOES NOT WORK. I plugged it into my SAMSUNG TV, and the screen does not display correctly... looks like lines on the screen. DO NOT COUNT ON ROKU any time soon to fix this. THIS FEATURE IS A JOKE!!!

  An excellent upgrade to Roku streaming devices.  I've used Roku streaming devices for years and I've never had one fail.  This streamer provides true 4K output and slightly improves wireless signal reception in areas where your wireless router signal may not be full strength.  Roku's remotes get slightly better with each generation and this one is no exception.  Buttons are crisper and presets for various streaming services work well.Roku's User Interface (UI)  has evolved.  It works well but as I test it against Apple TV's latest version and Amazon's latest UI I find Apple's UI to now be the most useful.  Roku in my view still beats Amazon's latest convoluted UI.  Roku should look at Apple TV's UI for the future.  Unfortunately, Apple has failed to produce a streaming stick and Roku fills this void nicely.I like Roku devices because they work well all the time.  They are like the Toyota of streaming devices.  They compete well pricewise.  They set up easily, are easy to use, stream well and are reliable.

  I like everything about this product as far as functionality, but it smells so badly that it smells up the whole room. I bought it and returned it , bought it again and the second one still reaked of mold and mildew like it had been stored in a damp place for ages. Since all the parts are plastic I doubt if it will ever get better. I washed the remote with bleach but it did not take the smell away. I think it's just permanently imbedded in the plastic. I'm afraid to return it again since the next one might just be the same problem; and it's so inconvenient to have to keep signing in to everything over and over again with a new one. I haven't even received the refund for the first one I sent back yet either so I'm kind of waiting to see what happens with that before I return this one again to avoid any confusion. I'm not sure what to do about this now..has anyone else had this happen?

  I usually do not write reviews, good or bad, but this time I am extremely disappointed. I have owned Roku for years. Unfortunately the quality of the operating system has been deteriorating slowly but surely. I recently purchased two Roku sticks + in order to upgrade from previous models which do not really support 4K - even though they say they do. The sticks worked fine for about 2 months. The last update Roku sent has made them pretty much worthless. Despite my fairly fast internet speed (I get speeds of just over  340 Mbps next to the router where the stick is placed) the stick takes forever to load any App. When I ""check the internet connection via the Roku App, I get little more than 25 Mbps - pitiful!. Amazon has stopped working altogether. Even YouTube is slow and when it finally loads the sound lags behind. I contacted Support and after they could not figure it out the problem (45 minutes) the guy told me to wait a couple of minutes while he ""check on it"" and just disconnected me. I'm switching to Apple TVI have put up with the slowing/deteriorating operating system because the Roku has been always easy to navigate but I feel that they have not cared to keep up with the streaming technology and feel that if I continue to stick with them (no pun intended) I will just continue to feel frustrated and will just waste my money. Time to switch.

  I bought this to replace a ROKU 2.  Amazon videos play some things.  CBS all access, ROKU site, PBS, most all of streaming stations  play nothing for more than 5 seconds without buffering.  After 3 or 4 buffers, it freezes.  Remote also is slow and frequently freezes.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled stations, rebooted ROKU,  move my router, cut off all devices that share the net,, used a wall outlet for power, disconnected Alexa,  My old ROKU 3 had no problems, but was heating up. Connection is rated as fair and speed is rated as good.  I have contacted the Amazon support line who offered a new device.  I have ordered the extender.  If that does not work I will send back.  A new device should work better that an old one that cost less.  I am afraid that this device is inherently  flawed.

  Worked great for first 9 months. Now I have dealing with customer service for last 3 months because of failures, lockups, freezes. They are totally incompetent, disorganized,  lacks any signs of customer satisfaction. Buy this with a throw away expectation when it fails.

  I think the ROKU system is awesome, but the Streaming Sticks interface to the remote control is horrible with useless voice command capability. I have had the Streaming stick for almost a year. When the remote works it is good, but that is rare. The original remote control started going bad after about 4 months. I asked ROKU to send me another one and they did.  And it is going bad also, or I thought. And then I looked up REMOTE CONTROL ISSUES on Streaming Stick and found there was an extender HDMI cable they will send you for free to fix the remote response lagging issues supposedly caused by the Streaming stick being plugged directly into your HDMI port. I though awesome, maybe now I won't have to wait up to 5 minutes for the remote control to respond to a button push. The cable came after about 4 or 5 days, and I tried it right away. IT MADE IT WORSE!!!!!.  I gave it three days and it did not get better. Worst remote control I have ever had on any TV. And I am 60 and have used countless TV's and remote controls. I had to start using the ROKU remote control app on my Samsung Smart Phone. Response is great on the app, but a remote without buttons that you have to look at every time you want to change the Channel or fast forward past commercials sucks.  SO.... I am sending it back before my year warranty is up.  I am going to try the top of the line Roku ULTRA. If that doesn't work, I think I will be going back to Dish Network. Best remote I have ever used on the Dish system.

  Great little device to ad Roku to TV without it.Couple of modification I did  to make it even better us this device.Just stick in to the TV HDMI port may work fine may not. I have the TV on the bedroom and the WI FI in the living room. The HDMI port on the back on the TV and when I inserted it was close to the back panel  of the TV therefore was not the best to get the fastest signal and heated up.I moved to the wall by using a high speed HDMI extension cable,find the best sweet spot  also used stud finder so the stud in the wall will not interfere with the signal.Also I got lucky to be attach to the wall just over the Xfinity Cable Box and on the top the box already I had a Xfinirty S 1 fan to coll the box. This way I got the two for one ""deal"" so the fan cooling both unite.Now I get the highest possible speed and bot the cable box and the Roku stick nice and cool so perform better and longer.Hop this help you to enjoy it trouble free the sticks.p.s the 4 star for the countless advertising even when you reduce the advertising by using the menu of the Roku.Free channels feel like you watching advertising with movie breaks.

  Had it on a second TV.  Worked ok for a while, not very snappy or responsive.  Started to die just before the one year warranty was up.  Have been dealing with Roku customer service.  They are impossible.  They aren't willing to stand by their product.  I've spent a month on the phone with them,""try this, try that""  over and over.  Clearly the item was detective and not working, but they really didn't want to replace it. I could send it back to them, at my expense, to see if they could get it working.

  This was not easy to set up. Ultimately I did not ditch my cable service like I thought I was going to. But I did downgrade it which saved me some money. We have multiple TV’s in the household, and it is to much of a drain on the internet to be watching at once. It was constantly buffering and it was annoying.Setting up: It took me almost 6 hours. It kept giving me error codes. I had to reach out to support multiple times to get it to work (also if you have to call support they charge you money). Thankfully I was able to sort this one out looking at their common problems. It was just frustrating.They don’t have long enough cords to plug into the wall. My second TV I still haven’t set up because I haven’t purchased extensions to use the Roku. They need to come with longer cords. My gaming devices has longer cords than this. Come on Roku.The voice recognition only works maybe 50% of the time. It is more frustrating than Siri. But when it does work I love this feature, it is something every cable/satellite service should have.I love all the TV channels and most of them are free. It is great. I down graded my TV package to the lowest level but I don’t feel I am missing out. There is so much to choose from. The application is basic, but I don’t mind if it has the channels I like. I love that it even has YouTube. Something Amazon fire doesn’t have.UPDATE: The life of the product doesn’t look hopeful. In less than two weeks my Roku has died. I am sending I back to Amazon for a refund. I am wondering if I should do the same with the other as well. For a $60 product you expect it to last. I’m hoping it was a fluke but this has me worried.

  Regarding the 1-star reviews about:“Roku Tech Support made me pay $$$$ to set up a Roku account“....these are from people that fell from a WELL KNOWN SCAM!Please Google “Roku scam” and you will see thousands of articles about FAKE ROKU TECH SUPPORT that tricks people into paying money for support and setting up an account.To avoid potential troubles, make sure your order is sold and shipped by Amazon, not a third-party seller.  Ordering from a third-party seller to save $5 is not worth the potential hassles you may encounter.Go to the official Roku website for questions, not some similar looking “help page” that pops up on Google or is listed on a fake owners manual that a shady third-party seller put inside your box.Long story short, do your homework!Regarding the actual product:5-stars all-around!  Stream quality, user-interface is excellent, voice recognition is great, and Alexa and HomeKit integration is outstanding.

  It works fine, runs much faster than my previous Fire Stick (menus, thumbnails and apps load faster).The battery cover runs nearly the entire length of the remote. Every time I push a button the battery cover flexes considerably, and it feels like I've inadvertantly opened the battery compartment. Very unnerving.I don't want Alexa in my house. This Fire Stick comes with Alexa, but the product description (or maybe questions/answers?) says that there's a setting to disable Alexa. I could not find that setting. I am now seeing commercials encouraging me to speak into Alexa. So the commercials know that I've got an Alexa-capable device even though Alexa is supposedly not enabled. I'm also now seeing an Alexa ""app"" in my suggested apps list. I have no idea what this app might be for. Is it needed for Alexa to work? Does it augment Alexa? Just a lot of sketchy info about a feature I don't want.When I am done watching for the day I put the Fire Stick into sleep mode. I did this with my previous Fire Stick, and it seemed to work as expected. But this new Fire Stick is up and running as soon as I turn my TV on, which makes me wonder if it ever does go to sleep.

  Very disappointed in the lackluster technology, and lack of communication. The fire TV stick light apparently lacks the ability to transfer multichannel audio output when using an optical connection. My current setup is where my TV transfers audio signals to my surrounded receiver via optical output, and the TV stick lite does not have the ability to send the proper audio to my TV, only allowing for 2 channel audio. Very disappointing to have a streaming device that can't send out multichannel audio signals, and even more disappointed to have that left out of the product information. Users may not have this problem with HDMI only connections, but this should caution anyone using an optical connection.

  I like the program options.  I have a smart TV and thought this would be rather redundant.  I also do not have Amazon Prime.  But there are enough nice features, like the ability to have the HGTV Go app and the DIY Go app and some of the Amazon free programming.  There is also some on demand programming that just isn't available on UVerse for some reason.It is a little difficult to navigate and find things at first but, I got accustomed to it.If you are looking to ditch cable, this is a good option.  Lots of programming available, especially if you have Prime.  Be aware, you still need internet service.

  After about 2 years of paying cable bills, that started under $100 p/month, and without really realizing it, the bill had quickly risen to over $250 p/month! Thing was, that wasn't even the cap! I was still getting some of the hardware at an introductory price that took a few dollars off per box, and some of the movie channels for free as a trial, but that would all be ending in 2 or 3 months. I'm sure when that happened, I would be hovering around $300 p/month for WATCHING TELEVISION!!!Uhhh.... no! So, I decided to cut the cord and get all my home's TVs on the Amazon ecosystem. I bought the Fire TV Recast and 6 Fire TV Stick Lites. I must say that the last time I had a Fire Stick it was the GEN 1 and it was OK but not as good as I would have liked it to be. That's why I was so pleasantly surprised by the Fire TV Stick Lite. They are fast and responsive (much, much more than the Gen 1s), easy to set up and get started, and seams effortlessly with Plex, Pluto TV, YouTube, and of course, the Fire TV Recast, and Netflix, which I plan to be the only monthly subscription that I will be paying for. Overall, I'm very pleased with the Fire TV Stick Lite. Alexa is installed and using voice commands to change the TV is so wonderful! I can also turn the lights off from my remote control when it's time to movie watch. I love it! Let's see the cable companies let me do that! I figure I'll be saving about $230 p/month now and all for an investment that was less than paying for 1 month of paying a cable bill. Not bad at all, Amazon.

  Overall I like this product.  If you are fanatic about volume, get the other fire stick as the lite stick does not have volume control.  I had to set this product up for my parent who is not technologically inclined.  Set up was not the issue.  Those who have lived 8+ decades with  channels and simple on/off features on a television have a hard time understanding apps and the ""timing"" of programs -- scheduling.  We need it for one program, but then we have to switch back to regular fios/cable for programs/channels that are on television.  It would be easier if there was a set channel function within the fire stick of the most watched channels/programs for ease and convenience-- especially for those not app oriented.

  Works great and is great for my non-Fire Smart TVs. However, I could not get signed in using my tv provider info for the History Channel app (Spectrum credentials) whereas on my older regular fire stick I was able to sign in fine. I purchased them recently for multiple TVs. The new ones just kick me out and back to Home. Some comments said to do a factory reset but these are brand new so I don't think that is the solution. So I just can't use that particular app on the TVs with the new lite fire sticks. My Fire Remote app on my phone works great with both the old Fire Stick and the new Fire Stick Lites, which is a plus!

  I bought 2 of these. One to upgrade the one in my son's room for xmas and one to upgrade  the one on my new smart TV in my room. I hooked mine up last night, fell asleep while it took forever to update itself or whatever. This morning I attempted to watch a program on Philo. This thing keeps shutting itself off and buffering for several minutes at a time. I turn Philo off and switch to Netflix, same thing.  Try Hulu, Disney and even Small Axe on Prime. Same thing! I unplug it and hook up my old Gen 2 Firestick... works like a charm with no shutting off or buffering at all. I am so disappointed in myself for wanting and thinking I could do better.

  So I have a fairly old TV that my sister gave me a few years back. It's not by any means a bad tv just not a ""smart"" tv so I wasn't ever able to watch any of the streaming services on it. I've been debating getting a new TV just so that I could watch my shows. This guy was on sale recently and I figured I'd give it a shot, glad I did! I downloaded EVERYTHING (Prime Video, Netflix, CBS, HBOMax, Hulu, Disney+.. EVERYTHING) and everything works so great! Also, you're able to speak into the remote what you want to watch and it pulls it from everywhere you have linked to show you how you can watch something. I'm so glad I didn't have to get rid of my TV just so I could watch my shows. Absolutely recommend!

  I can't say I'm a huge fan of the new layout for the home screen. They should at least give us a CHOICE where the navigation buttons are located. Top and left side good, middle.... ugh.And the TV button needing their blaster device... I'd rather not have that button there at all.Otherwise, though, no complaints. Setup was easy, apps and streaming works as well as on any of their other Fire TV products. New user profiles for Prime features is nice, my fiancé can stop burying my few selections added to my watch list with a her hundred at a time now. That's one new feature I'm stoked to have.

  I love fire stick lite it doesn’t have controls like volume and stuff but that’s ok I just wanted to try this cheaper version and I’m happy with it and like it even better than my ROKU I didn’t think that was possible!! All this free TV especially Pluto TV makes you feel like you have cable minus the monthly bills!! Pretty easy to set up takes just a few minutes. Try this you won’t be sorry!!!

  If you get one but already have another, whatever you do don't 'Add' the new one to your account.  Use another email address and user name.I've bought several and on one of the units I wanted to remove Hulu from an older unit that no longer was compatible with Hulu.  After I had done that I discovered that Roku had removed Hulu from ALL the other units, including one at the vacation house.I've found that even if you are directed to remove a misbehaving App before installing it, it also wipes the app off any other Roku's that didn't need to reinstall.Roku customer service is useless, no way to reach them and emails go unanswered.  To even get into your account you are forced to deal with the most annoying machination of the computer age, reCaptcha!  I have dropped blog accounts that require it.Why are all the streaming device companies worse than the cable companies we are trying to escape?

  I've had several Roku's and the stick is the best so far.  It typically streams very well, but streaming isn't flawless.  Having said that, I cannot confirm that it is a Roku issue.  We are on GigaBit service, but it is not perfect.  Hulu isn't perfect and we're pretty sure the service has gone down for a few minutes, but it's rare.  Netflix occasionally doesn't stream, but by the time we check using another device the Roku is streaming again, so it tough to tell.  There are a lot of variables.  The Roku stick seems to be more reliable than earlier Roku devices, but still has moments of confusion and it self-reboots, but it seems like this happens less than once a month and it's only down a minute or so.  When we had cable, it went out more often and for longer periods.  Never had a dish, but friends who do complain about it not working and not available in every room.Yes, if you don't want to move the stick from room to room and reboot it, every TV has to have one, but our cable company made us have a box on every TV and they charged us rent for them every month (3 months was about the cost of a Roku stick).  Some TVs now have apps built in, but the Roku allows us to add (and remove) channels and services our TV didn't come with and keeps them all in one easy place.

  So at first I did get the purple screen saying error, but after about a half hour of troubleshooting, I figured out I just needed to use a different hdmi port. It was very frustrating, but my new Sony 4k hdr TV will only work with this roku in the 2nd hdmi port. (I thought it would be the first, who knew...)  Then I had experienced how some people are saying their remotes just stop working. This had happened and it was an overall easy fix. It just needed to be paired with my roku once again. Also frustrating, but it's working again. Due to these two issues I would give it 3 stars, but when I finally got everything working, the quality is amazing! And the roku stick works very well. This was my first experience with Roku. Definitely make sure you have a 4k HDR ultra HD tv when buying this, otherwise I think you should stick with the cheaper one. So overall, I say 4 stars because the quality is so good, but i think the start up guide could be a little better with detailed instructions and trouble shooting for the remote and start up. Just my thoughts.

  I have been very pleased with each Roku product and here updated from Roku3 for my primary TV stations while having RokuTV sets on other TVs for bedroom and office. In WV where signal strength even with good routers and an extender remains neanderthal,  Roku + is definitely a plus.  And I love being able to load Hulu or Network rapidly and control volume at the Roku device itself. The reliability and innovation of all Roku products is a welcome change from the difficulties of Windows and most computer hard/software. All I would ask is ability to type my email on screen with a single click for choice of x.com, x.net, etc. instead of typing in each character.

  So far this year, we've ordered four streaming + sticks for 4 in-house and one RV usage.  The sticks work great. Long range RF remotes mean I can irritate the Wife Unit by changing streaming channels from two rooms away. These are our first streamers and they are light years ahead of the two Samsung ""smart"" TVs. Near instantaneous response to channel changes as measured against our zzzz response to channel changes from DISH TV. The voice recognition works about 80% of the time. That is good since I search for some weird stuff when going down the you tube video rabbit hole. They are all 4 happy with our regular 50 MB AT&T wifi and work even down to <13 MB/sec on 2.4/5 GHz after the signal goes through a wifi extender which isn't really needed (used for jamming neighbor's way-over-powered wifi). No pausing and plenty of buffering. They struggle a little (intermittant signal loss outrunning the buffering) with the campground wifi since it is always overloaded but it is not really a current problem since CA ""science"" says the virus can jump, from one campsite 150' to another, and has closed our campgrounds. We really like being able to get real news and grand-punkin programming in higher res than the compressed DISH signals. If there are any minuses, it would be that I accidentally keep hitting the 4 direct-tune buttons on the bottom two rows of the remote. We don't subscribe to any of the pay-to-streamers there. After the warranty is gone maybe I'll open up the remotes and disable the buttons. We were not able to get a ROKU streaming channel to work through ROKU even with their help once. They tried but couldn't get it to work even through the designers of the channel. We recommend the ROKU streaming stick+. So far, no stick failures amongst four of them. Be sure to order the free little HDMI extension asap from the site in the instructions with your serial #. It is great stress relief for the HDMI connection to the TV. We power two of the sticks off of the USBs on the TVs and two of the sticks with their USB wall wart power supply. No diff except for about 30 second ROKU reset after turning on TV if using TV USB connection for power. No, nobody compensated me for this spew. We like our ROKUs!

  I used to be a huge fan of Roku until they decided to act as badly as cable companies do. Roku decides which apps you can and cannot get. The latest two examples are HBO MAX and NBC Peacock networks. I PAY for HBO Max, but Roku refuses to allow the app because they hold the content providers hostage to pay them more money. To be clear, I didn't sign up for HBO Max through or because of Roku. I was already a subscriber with Spectrum and simply switched from HBO Go to Now. I should now have access to HBO Max but don't because the jerks at Roku decided they should get a cut to provide me the service I pay for.If you're thinking of cutting the cord to get away from your cable company, be aware that Roku apparently wants to be your cable company not release you from their grip.I have 3 Rokus in my house now and am now replacing them with Android TV. Fortunately, you can side load Android apps with Android TV to break your grip from this idiocy.

  Cable cutters!This Roku Streaming Stick+ works with YouTubeTV, Amazon, Netflix, Disney+, and CBS All Access.  I bought a similar Roku streaming stick from BestBuy several months ago and returned it because it did not support YouTube TV.  I made do with casting from my phone to my Chromecast for a while but missed the user interface of our other Roku TV.  I received this on July 23, 2020.  It was easy to set up, connected to my WiFi with ease, and I was watching my shows in less than 15 minutes.  By the way, the packaging says Copyright 2020 Roku, Inc.  Would buy again.  Would recommend to a frined.

  The best thing about this is the format. The USB stick shaped device is one , more device not cluttering up the TV area or unhidden wire running to the electrical socket. The worst thing about this device is the remote. It doesn't always work in a timely manner. You point it at the device, push a button and nothing happens for 15 - 60+ seconds (not an exaggeration for me). I've had instances where I have found my phone, pulled up the Roku app there, and made the same selection ... And then had the original function finally work leading to unnecessary interruptions. It's the worst! I've actually considered going back to my old Roku box because the remote always works. The only reason I don't is because I can't get some apps to work on my older box due to the software. What should also be mentioned is for some reason, Roku doesn't supply you with a connector you may need for charging the stick through USB. The connector is free, but you have to request it first. It should already be in the box. They even cover the shipping. Makes no sense and not good customer service because it was either use an extension cord (which I don't have) to plug it in (the original cord was to short for the height of my wall-mounted) or wait.

  Was thrilled to set up my 2 TVs with these streaming sticks in late November.But after a couple of weeks each remote failed to do anything on the Roku home page. Hmmmm....Turns out it was the batteries. So I installed new batteries.  Rinse, repeat.After going through 4 set of batteries in each device over a 6 week time period--and I don't use the Roku remote everyday. nor do I play a headset through the remote or do any video games--I got on Google and discovered there are thousands and thousands of complaints about these remotes gobbling batteries like candy. Roku IS aware of this issue. They will honor their warranty but want me to pay for return postage. Really? For their defect?So I am returning through Amazon, thanks to THEIR great return policy.

  I recently switched to Comcast for TV service, and the rep told me I could add additional TVs for free with a Roku. I looked at the options and picked this one.  I hooked it up to my Samsung TV and added all my streaming apps. It's perfect to have all my options on one input, on one device. I can stream my Comcast content, and access all my streaming services.  The voice control works fine, but it doesn't work as an input method for every app.  I also need to get used to how to FF and RWD with the remote, since it's so basic, it acts a little different that I am used to.  Lastly, the interface once it first turns on is a little slow for my taste, but nothing to make a big deal out of. I have Fire Sticks on my other TVs, but the Roku is quite nice!

  OK...with trepidation I'm cutting the cord with C-x cable for SO MANY reasons!!!! But Cost is the major one. By adding this Roku and a streaming service and DSL provider modem I've reduced my cable bill by 110%. I may regret it but the bundle scam was putting me into the red. Had to return this  Roku  because it overheated and replaced it with Firestick. I've added YouTubeTV so I can still have storage DVR  and 110 local channels. Add a Voip phone option (OOMA)  and voila!!! cord cut. Had to return as the stick overheated with warning messages frequently...major fire risk I suspect.Also with YouTubeTV app , Roku was redundant with the apps I have on my SmartTv and Amzon site subscriptions.FYI I love my breakup with C-x Cable. I now have the channels I WANT for 1/3 the bill, with better internet speed, and free phone service after my initial OOMA  Telo purchase. Love performance of Cent--y Link DSL. Now my so-called strongarm cable bundle is gone. I've  replaced it with my own bundle of Never changing DSL monthly cost, never paying for phone with free US longdistance and all the needed TV I chose [ broadcast (90 channels), subscriptions and DVR] and a faster internet connection! What's not to celebrate!!!!

  I bought this for the wireless strength extension.  It had gotten to the point that we could not watch TV in our family room, with download speeds fluctuations continuously between 0 and 45, but more and more often, we got ‘No Internet connection’ messages. Our serviced came out and speed tests were fine. He said, ‘You need a new ROKU!’  Did not believe it since old ones worked fine in bedrooms but when I saw this I had to try.We had purchased an extender two years ago and it did nothing.So far, I have not had one instance of buffering or outage, the system is working beautifully. Considering the cost ifv’extenders,’ getting a fully loaded ROKU that gives me consistent and strong WiFi/internet to our main television, I would recommend this to everyone.

  Somehow, a company called Caligeeks hijacked my Roku. On 2/8/2020 during the setup of this Roku the screen wouldn't allow me to continue setup unless I called the listed phone # on screen. It took me to a company called Caligeeks who said Roku had changed their policy as Jan 1. Now you had to pay a fee of $79.99 to set up a five year account with them, or $129+ for a lifetime account. They made me believe I couldn't work my Roku without them and that all Roku customers would have to pay this fee each time they bought a Roku. I don't know how their phone # appeared on my Roku, but I argued with them for an hour (since I already had a Roku and knew it was free to set up an account). They had thick accents and were hard to understand on top of it.If Roku is going through a 3rd party for weekend support, there should be information about it upfront instead of lying to customers telling them it's MANDATORY. It's not mandatory. It left a bad taste in my mouth for Roku.Also, the Roku remote was faulty. I messed with it forever and followed all the troubleshooting multiple times and it still didn't work. I was fed up and returned the whole thing, but the device itself seemed to work fine.

  Update 01/14: HDMI Extension cable showed up, once plugged into the correct port on the TV everything seems to working fine thus far. The instructions Roku provides does state something about making sure your HDMI port is 2.0 or something like that so the frustration was more my POS Vizio ""4k"" Smart TV and not so much the Roku. Just wished I would've seen a review of someone having a similar problem or the seller mentioning this as possibly being a problem on the product page. Either way it works now.I haven't even gotten much past the setup of this stick as for some reason it is throwing an HDCP error on the TV. I assume it something between the Vizio smart TV and this stick not talking to each other correctly through the HDMI port I plugged it into (Odd as I can plug anything else in that port and it works). Unfortunately given the length of this stick I am not able to plug it into any other HDMI port except the side, so in order to try and use a different port I had to shell out an additional $10 for an HDMI extension cable. That cable has not shown up yet, but if it does not work by switching ports I am returning this. The voice remote will also not work with the Vizio TV and the only ""support"" Roku gives you through the error link is how to repair the remote to the Roku itself. Funny cause I got this model specifically to use for Volume and power on the TV also and that doesn't even work. Hoping that has to do with the HDCP error as well but we will see. All in all thus far I am highly disappointed.

  This is a great little gadget if you don’t have a smart TV and/or are an Xfinity customer with a TV that doesn't have a cable box. I've been able to ditch the useless little free receiver that Comcast supplied after I exceeded the number of cableboxes that were included with my plan. The Comcast receiver only picked up non-HD channels. With Roku and the new Xfinity app, I not only have all of my HD channels, but I've also got Netfix, Amazon Prime, Tubi, etc. On top of that, the little Roku remote allows me to control the TV volume and power, so I don't need to hassle with multiple remotes. Some people have complained that the Roku remote is not friendly since it doesn't have a keypad, but the settings button will open a virtual keypad and allow you to enter a TV channel. It takes an extra step, but that is a minor inconvenience and, for me, not worth the loss of a star when you consider all that you get. Setup was a breeze, picture quality is excellent, and operation is responsive and easy. My only regret is that I didn’t buy this sooner.

  I've previously purchased and installed about 7 of these streaming stick +s, all without a problem.  I purchased this one in January for my home, and the remote didn't work out of the box.  I did all the troubleshooting, replaced batteries with new (which it drained in one day), searched Roku community boards, and it was clear this is a faulty remote.  (I used the iPhone Roku app to control the stick and that worked perfectly, so we know it was the remote itself.)  I reported all of this on the community boards with no reply from Roku.  I tried customer service.  No phone number was available to call, and email correspondence was broken, so I used the chat feature.  I spent about 40 minutes on the chat explaining all the troubleshooting I did, providing serial and model numbers, etc, etc.  I just asked for them to replace the remote, not the entire device.  Well, as of today, they have yet to respond with any resolution (the device was purchased in early January, it's a month later as of this writing).  By the way, did I mention that according to the Roku community, this is a known issue?I returned the entire device to Amazon, after speaking to Amazon customer service, and they supported that return.  I purchased a new one (for $10 less!) but when it arrived, the box had already been torn open, so given my recent experience, I returned it to Amazon the same day.I know everything is crazy regarding the pandemic, but this was a simple issue they could have easily resolved and kept a happy customer.  I may purchase an Apple TV instead (yes, it's more expensive, but I have an older one and it works great--and Apple customer service is excellent)  Not sure what I'm going to do with the others, but if they begin to have issues, they may be going back as well.  Sorry Roku, I was your biggest fan before this recent experience.  Please fix your customer service.When they work, they're great.  Good luck if they don't.

  It was GREAT while it worked...until it didn't. It would randomly reboot in the middle of streaming. The situation quickly got worse and it would do it every couple minutes. Then the remote stopped working.Roku support was HORRENDOUS and is limited to email correspondence...about once a day.Google just came out with a chromecast with a remote. I highly recommend it instead.

  We've loved Roku for a long time. This year we decided to upgrade our TV to a 4k HDR Samsung. To provide the streaming services, we got this Roku Streaming Stick +. Unfortunately, the picture quality through the Roku was terrible - washed out colors, contrast too high, everything too dark, and lost clarity. This was universal, but especially bad in some Disney Plus titles like the Mandalorian, which was unwatchable.I still had the old LED TV with a Roku 3, and I compared them side by side. The old setup looked perfect. So I plugged in my Roku 3 to the new TV - and the issues all disappeared. It was crisp, bright, and colorful. So the issues were with the new Roku Streaming Stick+.To make a long story short, after much experimentation and research, I was able to get the new Roku to look as good as the old. Here's how you do it:• Go to Settings > Display type and set it to just 4k -  WITHOUT the HDR. It turns out that there are some issues with Samsung TV's HDR settings and 4k Rokus. Upon changing this setting, I found my picture through the new Roku Streaming Stick+ was once again clear and bright.• The other issue was all the ""smart"" features on the Samsung were messing things up. Turning them all off and setting the TV to ""Game mode: On"" for the Roku brought back the intended brightness, contrast, and color range.As an aside, when these issues appeared, I also bought a Chromecast with Google TV. It had the same issues as the  new Roku, but did NOT have the ability to turn off HDR, so it wasn't able to solve all the display issues like the Roku.I hope this helps someone!

  I will start off by saying, that we are on Apple family and use 4 AppleTV 4K's in our house.  We needed a fifth streaming device that will get the least amount of use and did not wish to pay the Apple prices.  After some research, I decide to try this affordable Roku Streaming Stick+ and I am glad that I did.The Roku Streaming Stick+ was very simple to setup with an HDTV & the directions were were clear and concise.  Once I typed in my Wifi information it immediately connected on the 5 GHz band.  After a quick software update, I put our apps that we mainly use onto the Roku and I was streaming.  The streaming quality was no different then the AppleTV's quality.  The main apps we are using were all available on Roku, which includes:  FuboTV, Netflix, Amazon Prime, & HBO Max.  Also, the remote works very well and I was happy that it came with batteries.After one week of use, we have had no issues streaming on the Roku and we watched in all formats including:  SDR, 4K, HDR10.  This is a good price considering you get all these formats.My gripe's about the Roku include:  The menu UI.  My 15 year old son commented that the graphs & layout looked ""old"" and ""not high tech.""  Those comments made me laugh, but I absolutely agree with him.  Perhaps Roku could do an update to the IU now that it is 2021.My second gripe, but I knew this going in:  No Dolby Vision.  At least the Roku is able to process Dolby Vision movies as HDR10.

  TLDR:  worth it, buy it.Over the years of the streaming revolution, Roku decided to toss their hat into the ring.  They were absolutely garbage.  Delayed remote input, latency issues on wifi, and limited streaming options were just some of the reasons I despised Roku, ESPECIALLY the sticks.It's been YEARS since I've given them a chance though.  My son received a Roku TV from his grandmother.  She got my wife and I a Roku TV and she upgraded her own TV with this exact Roku stick.I was blown away by how well it works.  There's plenty of features but the two I enjoy most are the voice control though the App and being able to toggle between Roku devices on the same network.  These features didnt really exist back in the day so I was utterly amazed by them.  Not only were they available, but they work VERY well.For streaming options, you've got just about anything you'd want.  I've got my cable on there, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, YouTube, Minno, and BabyFirstTV.  It's serves me well for doing just about everything I could want out of a streaming stick.It ALSO has screen mirroring capabilities!  Not really an option people seem to use a lot, but definitely worth mentioning.  I used to swear by chromecast devices for streaming and screen mirroring, but since being turned onto Roku (again) I was more than eager to get this stick!

  I’m not an Alexa-type person so I don’t use it. I have no problems using the remote. One day I’ll use Alexa (but not today). This was my first experience with a Fire Stick so I made some mistakes. This is a ‘lite’ Fire Stick. The remote only works with the Fire Stick. The TV had to be turned off and on manually. I couldn’t figure out how to install the Fire Stick. My friend did the entire installment. There are dozens of movies, TV shows, sports, news etc. This needs internet service. No other  service is needed- that alone saves hundreds of dollars. My new TV has the Fire Stick built in. That’s the way to go!

  I'm confused. Works great on my other Element TVs. Just not this one. Amazon tech worked with me on my ""no source found"" issue with the HDMI. Unplugging the TV. Recycling the power on the Fire stick. Finally decided to send another under warranty. Same issue. Soon as I turn the TV off and back on, the TV just cant find it.  Had to settle with putting the old one back in, which works fine, just slow and I miss out on the updates.

  Fire stick claims my account is invalid or I have poor internet connection...that's 💯 B.S.  I can't even set up a different account...what a huge ...disappointment Zero customer service...Why does my fire stick home page say I have a internet problem ..but the settimgs show i am connected with no problems...only fire stick does this out of 2 other streaming devices amd and one T V and why is your customer service so uneducated in problem solving is that so Amazon doesnt have to stand behind their own product.And the ""firestick-feedback-us@amazon.com email address is totally invalid just proves how Amazon gets away with misleading customers at such a high volume....

  I got this on sale and decided for the price what the heck. I was surprised at the quality of the voice recognition. It was easy to set up the actual unit to the TV. Adding each app took a while to do so set aside some time. You can choose to set up watchlist or libraries. It shows what is currently airing that you may like. It is definitely geared towards Amazon Prime Video consumers but I have multiple apps that I stream quite easily with my fire stick. As a Prime Member you do have access to a lot of included apps. One con is that Sometimes the apps get stuck and no matter what you push on the remote you are dead in the water until the system refreshes. It is not a long time but it is irritating.  Otherwise, The remote generally is fast, responsive and easy to use. Yes you can watch local news, most prime time TV shows and then so many other streaming apps are available! Some apps have in ad commercials that you cannot skip but you had to watch commercials paying your internet provider anyway. This fire stick  Makes going to bed very hard when you can binge watch about anything you want.

  I bought this stick to replace my much older Fire Sticks. I had noticed that shows and apps were taking longer to start. I was constantly getting ""no internet connection"" and ""Home not available"". Apps I listen to, especially Iheart, would cut off while streaming. I decided to replace my Firestick hoping newer technology would help.I just unplugged the old one, plugged in the new one, set it to my internet and it updated itself (took about 5 minutes).This Firestick is so much faster than the old stick. Much faster downloads and no interruptions on streaming. I should have done this long ago.

  I couldn't not get this for $17.99  I want an Apple TV, but money is tight these days.  So even $18 was a stretch but hey its pretty amazing what kind of tech you can get for that these days.It does YouTube, Netflix, and Prime Video which is all I really use, and my TV's are only 1080p so its perfect.  Playback is smooth as long as internet holds up, and works fine at non peak hours from my apartment buildings public wifi.  I expect it to work perfectly when I get my own internet account.  When I eventually upgrade to a better streaming device I will use it on my bedroom TV.

  Finally Amazon is making is much easier to discover new shows and movies to watch.  This has a better menu than the older models and is pretty easy to navigate.  If I could change one thing is the TV feature a the bottom of the controls.  It's right below the play button and I've been accidentally hitting it.  It's easy to get back to what I was watching before so maybe I'll get used to it.  This Fire seems to be so much more responsive than the older ones so I've updated all but one of my Fire Sticks.  I love Amazon's integration and compatibility with all my other Amazon electronics.  I'm hooked.

  I originally gave it one star because I couldn’t get it to update the fire stick. But James from customer service called and what happened was this fire stick was supposed to have been lost in the mail and they re-issued a new one, meanwhile the lost one actually was delivered today that is the reason why it wouldn’t update because they had already canceled that particular fire stick. Once it was cleared up it downloaded like a dream. I love it. I downloaded all my free TV apps no problems whatsoever. I am so happy with it because I plan on dropping U-verse and going strictly with just Internet and streaming.

  We had an extra tv but no coaxial cable to hook up another cable box and since we stream a few services like Netflix and hbo so we bought this so our 67-year old dad can watch his shows. Very easy to manage but I find myself restarting the fire stick every now and then fue to network disconnection. It’s connected to our 5G and it’s maybe 10 ft away from the router, maybe that’s the issue. I’ll switch it back to our 2G and see if that might solve the issue for a steady connection since 2G is convenient for devices that are long range. Aside from this issue it’s been very simple and easy to manage.

  This Fire stick is my first foray into a streaming service and it did not disappoint. Setup was fairly easy, howevernewbies need to read the instructions and follow the steps to connect to their WiFi.  If you are not a mega TVwatcher and don't care to pay for extra apps the Free tab gives you lots of choices and saves your budget. I ama huge youtuber so that alone is reason enough to like this gadget. As a recent cord-cutter from cable I am onlysorry it took me so long to try this. So far I'm totally enjoying  using it and I'm like a kid in a candy store just having so many options. One of the best purchases I've ever made. If you're new to streaming I think this is a great ""gateway"" tool.

  You get to watch TV without cable.  Easy to install.  Just plug it in.  Plug into HDMI, and plug into power.  There's an app which turns your phone into a remote control  You can sideload your own content.Nothing is free.  You have to have an Amazon Prime account.  Most channels offer you a preview of the show, or a screenshot, and you have to sign up for an account and pay to watch it.I get to watch Melissa Lee and Jim Cramer, with all their shenanigans.  Cheering, dancing, and partying when the market crashes.  Telling us to ""buy Bear Stearns""  and lose our 401K.

  I already have an older version of this but decided to give this one a try and I'm very pleased.  It's so easy to search using Alexa so I'm actually using Fire TV much more often than I had been.  I'd hoped to get my older one installed on a TV in my bedroom.  However, the area to insert the Fire TV stick into is too high for me to reach without using a step stool.  That's too frightening to contemplate so I'll just keep it for now and decide what to do with it in the future.  Perhaps when the pandemic is behind us I can convince an employee at my senior living community to give it a try.

  I purchased this to replace an original Fire TV box (2016), as it was slow and required rebooting often to work properly. I have it installed into the HDMI port on my home theater receiver, not directly to the TV, and it is working perfectly.I am completely satisfied with this purchase. It is way more responsive than the old unit it has replaced and the set up was a breeze.

  Let me start by saying that I have a Fire TV Stick 4K and I love it, it is working fine.  But, our new Fire TV Stick Lite is not.  A factory reset seemed to have fixed most of our problems except for the remote. It continues to lose connection to the stick.  Amazon is sending a replacement remote, and it will be arriving soon.Here are the problems we were experiencing in the beginning:1.  User interface freezing2.  Losing audio3.  Losing WiFi connection4.  Remote stops workingWe enjoy using our Fire TV Stick Lite and eagerly awaiting future updates to eradicate some bugs we have encountered.

  I’m really in awe with what this little thing is capable of doing.

I’ve been telling my friends about this and unfortunate for me most of them already knew. Better be late than never I guess. Thing I love the most is there’s a web browser. None of my Apple TV’s have a web browser. I give this sucker two thumbs up.

I can not believe I had to prey it apart with a thin knife just to get it open. 1 injury involve before using knife where my thumbs slipped and scrapped the other thumb. But setting it up was like plugging in a lamp! Please go back to the drawing board and use some ingenuity and redesign the opening of remote  because you state:Certified for Humans: Struggle-free, tinker-free, and stress-free. No patience needed—it's actually simple. well  it was a struggle.  and yes I needed the patience of job to stop myself from throwing it out the door!

  Very easy to set up and use, this little device is basically plug and play. There are many apps to choose from and easily log into. My frustration is the function of the device itself, I am tech savvy so I am pretty sure it's not user error.The device requires a restart each time I switch apps or the sound does not work. For example: I can start off in Hulu, great sound. But if I switch to Netflix, Prime, Disney+, Vudu...etc... goodbye sound. Adjusting the sound in the Settings is no use. It doesn't matter the selection, I tried them all just to be sure. The only thing that resolves the sound issue is restarting the Firestick itself (I am not the only one with this issue; thanks YouTube!). This is super annoying. I can watch a show on one app, my daughter wants to watch a show on a different app...restart... I want to continue watching my show on the first app...restart... and so on. You should not have to restart in-between apps. I guess I expected to much from this little device. My smart blu-ray DVD player we use in another room workes better with multiple app use/sound. I may have to break down and buy another. I had only paid $8 for this at BestBuy through a holiday promo they had going on so I am not out a large about which makes me happy.

  A great deal for $18. I now have 4 of these (2 with TV volume & power controls). Have had a ""new-in-box"" 21 inch monitor collecting dust for years.  The Fire Stick appears to function with any monitor that has an HDMI INPUT (not output, such as a laptop.) The most labor intensive part of the install was removing the monitor and the Fire Stick from their boxes and hooking up the cables.  The monitor came to life instantly, Fire Stick attached to WiFi, downloaded latest firmware, and was ready to use. Other than my existing (over-priced) 300MB Internet connection, I can watch thousands of shows, You-Tubes, News channels, etc basically for free.  The abundance of ads is extremely annoying, and I'm constantly reminded that if I paid for subscription services, there would be far fewer ads. (Ain't no free lunch.)Makes an excellent portable or garage ""TV"", especially if you can get local TV reception with rabbit ears, or high-tech equivalent.I have no other Alexa devices, so I can't comment on integration. And per the item description: ""Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote Lite (no TV controls)"", there is no volume control to rate.

  Edit: When I left this review, I received a call from Amazon Customer Support. I bumped the rating up to a 3 from a 2, since this only shows how good the support for this device is. I can't give it a 4 or 5 until Twitch stops freezing for streaming too long; However, definitely better then I first thought.Original review: Twitch is a property of Amazon, and yet, if I stream Twitch for too long, it freezes. The only way to fix it is to go all the way into the settings to force stop Twitch. Restarting it fixes it, but it's a pain to do it literally every single time. I figured that the Fire Stick would be the way to go since Amazon owns Twitch, but it was not.If you only run the Fire Stick for bursts, it seems to work fine; However, running it for any length of time (such as overnight or most of the day) will cause it to freeze and you'll have to restart it.Wouldn't recommend this unless you're just looking for something cheap. It gets the job done, but not without it's fair share of bugs and inconveniences.

  This product is terrific! Like many others I wish I had cut the cable out a long time ago. The set up was super simple. I did purchase the Paramount app through Amazon so I could watch alot of CBS programming but outside of that I'm seeing all I want to just like before it's just in a different way. Most of what I watch I can get through my Hulu subscription,  like ABC and NBC and Fox shows it just means waiting a day. If a show I want to see is on Monday night then I wait until Tuesday to watch which is no big deal to me as I recorded most things on my DVR unit anyway for watching later. I'll be saving about $100 a month and that is big to me. There is so much programming out there. And all the old old shows I watched like NYPD Blue, Hill Street Blues, ER, The Practice....you can watch from the beginning. Hulu is a great resource for ALOT of things. My Hulu plan does have commercials but they are brief and knowing the money I'm saving I can deal with it. Same with alot of streaming stuff, you might need to sit through commercials but I say give it a try. You can always go back to cable if you don't like it so you don't have anything to lose. Remote is easy to use too. You should give it a shot!

  I've been threatening to ""cut the cord"" for years.  When the cable bill hit nearly 50% of my property tax bill, I realized it was time.  The Firestick is stupid simple to set up and the product I purchased to adapt an old TV to HDMI (also purchased thru Amazon) was also very easy to set up.  I now have three Firesticks and am saving a boatload on cable!!!  This product has everything you could want in terms of Apps and the only drawback is that cable companies don't stream all apps (mine doesn't live stream ABC).  However, most have delayed-view options (no subscription necessary) on the few Network shows I would watch (like GMA).  I'm not sure if we can use this forum to recommend one of the live streaming apps and there are a lot of them at varying costs-per-month but I find that Philo gives me nearly everything I ever used to watch and at $20.00 a month, you can't beat it.  Don't put it off!  Take the plunge and cut the cable!

  only one complaint ... like much of the Amazon eco-system this device also falls short on having all the usual options and stations one would expect these days - specifically, a deal with HBO Max which makes my subscription a pain in the neck since they had HBO Go previously - besides that, an absolutely fantastic device at a ridiculously low giveaway price - buy it!

  Something is wrong with this fire stick. It doesn’t play sound about 85% of the time. I have to restart it almost every time I want to watch something and then the sound will play. Very annoying. Tried on multiple TVs so I know it’s not an issue with my tv.UPDATE: contacted Amazon support, they gave me some troubleshooting tips and were unable to resolve the issues. They quickly sent out another fire stick, it is having the exact same issue and I’m having to turn the fire stick on and immediately restart it every time I want to watch something. It’s so annoying.

  I’ve been buying fire sticks fir several years now since I cut the cable cord. This is the 4 or 5th one ive bought em for all my tvs. This is first time I bought the firestick lite and was kinda caught off guard with it as it was an error on my part. But I’m kinda of glad that I got it. It has a “tv” button option which takes me to live IMBd TV which has limited channels but it’s a nice option to have. So overall I’m glad I got the lite version. It’s also about $10 cheaper than typical firestick.  It doesn’t have tv/volume buttons either but it’s still usable.

  Really hate the latest update, we'd been heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem but with this latest update, it's time to make like a tree and get out of here.The ""home"" screen is not customizable, so you're forced to navigate though a very annoying ""next up for you list"" which is mostly all garbage. Then there are sponsored banner ads which is happily pay not to see but don't see any option to do that.There are any activity tracking settings on by default, so if you do buy this (and hey maybe you like this UI) turn off the tracking

  I've been using a Roku for streaming on two TVs. I've grown disgusted with Roku's streaming apps not being current with changes in streaming services (such as HBO GO vs HBO Max), and  when my Amazon Prime app bombed on it, that was it - I bought two Firesticks and replaced the Rokus.....and WOW! The picture quality is so much better it's like dumping an old standard def TV for an HDTV...the apps load faster and I love being able to simply tell Alexa to find Vikings on Amazon Prime and it's there....wow...I love these and am so glad I dumped the old Rokus.l

  It works good enough i suppose. The speed is great. Functionality is fine, however everytime my TV is turned off the firestick loses audio. Have to reset the firestick every single time. After the first reset, about 30 minutes into playing anything, audio quality fails and it sounds terrible/ unbearable. Have to reset again. Its not my network or my TV, it is the firestick and based of reports from other customers at support, seems to be no fix for it, so I guess it is what it is

  This was my 1st Roku device, and my 2nd streaming ""stick"" (the other one being a Fire TV stick 2019 generation).  I had read articles comparing the 2 and thought Roku might be better.  It was nicer in some ways, but lacking in one important feature area - data saving and data monitoring.Pros:-Easy setup (about the same as my Fire TV Stick)-Clean interface (less ads and overall easier than Fire TV Stick)-Lots of apps/channels (about the same as Fire)-Xfinity Stream beta app works better on Roku than on Fire right nowCons:-Had to find special link to signup for Roku without giving them a credit card. I pay for my streaming services by signing up directly with Netflix, Disney+ etc and didn't want Roku in the middle of that, especially just to get started and try it out.  But if you like to buy a single movie ""on demand"" thru any Roku channel, you'd want to have a credit card on file, so maybe this wouldn't be a big deal to some.-Volume & especially the Mute buttons located on side of remote are easily clicked by accident while holding the remote in your hand-Couldn't get the Roku remote to control my TV to change the input to the right one for watching the roku-Can't install Firefox web browser for full surfing (can do this on Fire, its clunky but a nice option to have)-Can't put it into Sleep mode for low power and no data usage (Fire stick does have this)-Can't see any data usage by app/channel...Fire TV Stick allows this under Settings>Preferences>Data Monitoring.  It is a nice way to see how much a particular app is using so that you can attempt to control data usage in that app's settings (or choose to watch things in the lower usage apps).  i.e., Disney+ defaults to a very high streaming quality using 3-4Gb per hour.  At least you can change that quality within their app to save data.  But having the Fire stick show you the usage per app is a handy way to evaluate which apps are data hogs.  Roku doesn't have this feature.-Can't limit the streaming quality (aka data usage) in the Roku Stick settings - there was a hidden option at one time that may have done this (Bit Rate Override).  You can still get into that setting but it doesn't appear to work anymore and the Roku support forum reply is basically saying ""sorry, too bad"" because hidden/developer features are not intended to be supported so this isn't a bug.  Jeez, that's lousy - fair point in the software world, but this was a hidden feature discussed all over the internet and used by many prior to 2019.  Roku forum also suggests you should set your home router to limit the data used by the device - not all routers can do that by device, not all users can do that.So, look, I'm sure some of you will think the data usage issue isn't Roku's fault, blame your ISP for putting caps, use the features within your channels/apps to limit usage, etc.  A few of our streaming svc apps/channels give you the ability to throttle the data usage with quality/bit rate settings, but most do not.  I don't think its too much to ask a long-established streaming device maker to include a feature for this.  And since the Amazon Fire TV Stick does this, I'm going to return this Roku and get a 2nd Fire stick when they go on sale.I did really like the cleaner interface on the Roku and wanted to like it enough that I could give one to my 70+ yr old parents, but not if I can't easily limit their data usage at the stick.  Sorry Roku, you didn't earn my business.

  My family has owned 2 other Roku Sticks and have gotten a huge amount of use out of each one.  One of the sticks we use everyday, many hours a day, with our streaming service, making the roku stick is our primary way of watching TV.  By and large, the sticks have worked really well for many years.But recently, as the quality/quantity of TV streaming increased, we found that having a Roku stick that was quite a few years old, wasn't performing as well as would like.  It still worked, but we found it dragged when trying to search or trying to scroll through the, seemingly, hundreds of channels/options that are available.So, it was time for an upgrade.  We choose the Streaming Stick Plus and, after using for a few months now, we wish we had upgraded far sooner.The new stick is easily able to handle the demands that streaming puts on it .  Each channel we choose comes up much faster than with the old sticks.  I think, though i don't know i can prove it, that the new stick is able to receive/utilize a stronger wifi signal, especially as compared to the older model.The on-screens controls that come with the newer, upgraded version of the roku are much easier to use.  the new remote, with built-in controls to turn the tv on/off, to control the volume of the tv and to mute the volume of the tv means that having a seperate, tv only, remote isn't needed.And, we've have not only been having fun using the voice controls on the remote, we've found the voice controls to be an extremely helpful shortcut for many different sites.I haven't yet tried hooking the roku up to Alexa, as that isn't a major plus for me, but I might try doing that in the future.so now i'm thinking that it might be a good time to go ahead and upgrade that one remaining, older roku that we have.  yep, that sounds like a good idea to me.

  Recently we got just sick and tired of paying $140 a month to be forced to watch endless commercials and ten-year-old reruns. I have been an Amazon Prime member and a real fan of the Fire TV Stick I've been using in addition to my cable service for years now, so when we decided to cut the cable bill and upgrade to a newer version of the Firestick we became interested in the ROKU Streaming Stick as well because we have heard a lot of great things about ROKU too. So I got one of each. I don't regret either. And I DONT miss the cable bill either!The ROKU streams beautifully, rarely ever an issue, EVER, with pausing to buffer; Loss of signal NEVER happens, and the picture is crisp and clear--actually as good as if not better than what I experienced with paid-for cable TV. My only real complaint is the sound: I have to crank-up the volume on my TV to get enough volume to understand what is going on.I enjoy the flexibility that ROKU offers in-that I can sign-on to Prime, HULU, or any channel available, including the ROKU Channel (Which I've come to enjoy immensely). I love that I have control to watch what I want, when I want it, without having to spend 40% of the time I've PAID for being force-fed ad after ad after ad,  ad-nauseum. On most free Channel Apps I find they only show two to four commercials per break, and there are fewer breaks making the advertising tolerable. I don't mind watching a few ads to compensate for watching TV for free. I just HATE watching endless commercials on a service that I'm paying for!I also like that you can purchase or rent movies right from your TV and that there are so many new releases available.Sure! The move to ROKU has taken some adjustment, but it's soooooo much better than cable TV! And I'm putting that 140 bucks a month I used to spend on cable TV to much better use.

  First off, I want to be clear that activation of the Roku device is free. Purchasing the device is the only money you pay to Roku. If you have somehow end up on a website claiming that you have to pay them an activation fee or an upgrade fee just to be able to use your Roku device then you have navigated to the wrong address and it is a scam. What you do have to pay for, if you choose to do so, is any of the paid subscription streaming services you want. Some services require a paid subscription and some don't. To name a few:  Watching basic YouTube (the same ones you watch for free on your phone, tablet, or computer), Tubi TV, Pluto TV, and hoopla (if available through your public library) are all free of charge. Netflix, Amazon Video, CBS All Access, YouTube TV, and Apple TV+ charge a monthly fee, but that has nothing to do with whether or not you use a Roku device to access their content.We bought a TCL Roku TV a couple years ago and, between Netflix and Prime, found that we weren't watching cable television anymore.  So we downgraded to internet-only service through our cable provider and got this stick for our bedroom TV.Unlike some of the less expensive Roku offerings, the remote that comes with this one does both TV power and volume, so as long as you're getting all your content through Roku (and never need to switch inputs to, say, cable/satellite/antenna service or a DVD player) you don't need to have a separate TV remote.  I was surprised the remote doesn't have a mute button, though.  Our TCL Roku TV's remote had such a button.  So if you're a heavy user of the mute button you may find that this does not in fact save you from needing a separate TV remote. I'm also a little troubled that our Roku TV, which we bought new only about two years ago, doesn't support Apple TV+. This particular streaming stick does support it. But it seems like a couple years is way too early for a streaming device to be even starting to creep into obsolescence. I have no interest in buying a new Roku stick every few years, and hope this isn't a sign of what's to come.It's also clear that the Roku stick has no idea whether the TV is on or off.  This means that if you just push the power button in the middle of watching something, it will keep playing--and perhaps even advance automatically to the next show.  This means you'll lose your place in a series and, perhaps more importantly, will consume more power and data.  So remember to stop playback when you turn off the TV.  Or get one of those power strips that automatically turns off accessories when the master device turns off. (Or buy a Roku TV instead of a separate TV and Roku stick--but remember my comment above about sliding into obscelescence.)If you're looking for free entertainment, there are some options but you probably won't find them up to par with paid cable TV or perhaps even with free over-the-air TV.  Tubi has some content, including a ""Not on Netflix"" section.  Pluto TV is okay--it has a lot of channels, but they're largely underwhelming.  There's a local news ""channel"" that in our case gives us content for the nearest big city, an hour away, rather than our actual local news stations.  The Roku Channel occasionally has a movie worth watching.  Your public library may offer some content through Hoopla as well. So there are some free options, but you're unlikely to be completely satisfied without some form of paid entertainment.

  I'm not buying any more Roku devices. Not after how things have gone with HBO Max and Twitch.The ONLY draw that Roku had was supporting ALL the apps i use slightly better than the built-in apps of my TV. And now theyre not doing that because in their greed theyre trying to double-dip by charging me a premium for the device AND the content providers for a piece of their action.  You dont need this.  Just use the apps on your TV.

  This roku streaming stick its nice, you'll stream in 4 if it's available from streaming services, the one little problem I encountered was that I was trying to power it with a different cable that did power it but I couldn't pair the remote, after switching to the included cable everything worked fine, so yeah use the cable included to power it it looks like it's designed that way to work the two together, other that that little issue everything works great, the one thing I didn't like was roku customer service you can't call anyone they send you to the website that is extremely useless and they take forever to reply any emails and that's why I rated this product 4 stars

  Overall this was a great upgrade from our Apple TV 3rd gen. We are only using for 1080p content at the moment.Super small & portable.If you're already a Roku user, the interface is identical, at least to my 2018 TCL TV. The remote automatically paired with the IR on my 2012 LG Plasma, which I didn't want at first, but this meant that it works also with my Vizio soundbar for volume control, so that works well too.One gripe: every time you power off the TV, the Roku must start up again each time you turn it back on. This sometimes takes 30 seconds to fully become functional. Maybe this is just me, but worth noting if you turn your TV on and off several times per day.Another thing to mention, especially if you're coming from an Apple TV: the interface for each app is different, so it takes some getting-used-to.

  I was going through the setup procedure and it came time to enter the code for activation. It said my account was BLOCKED and I had to call the number on the screen to get activation.  I called the number and they want a ""REGISTRATION FEE"" .....there was no activation fee .....It was a new policy by Roku put in effect in May. They wanted $80. I said this sounds like a scam and hung up.They had  information on my Roku account ...email, phone number, other Roku products that I had.I later got a text form Debbie the ""account manager"" who said if my Roku is still not working to answer ""yes"" to the text and she would get me the cheapest option, she sent the same text the following day. the numbers she called from were 914-334-6824 & 201-500-6506

Roku in it great wisdom has NO phone support unlike other companies like Amazon who offer great support including phone. support NOT roku they seem not to care in future I will recommend the fire stick it works not like  Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device  .  I went through 4 of these units and returned all.The  Roku Premiere  I have been using has none of the issues all 6 of the Roku Streaming Stick+ I have had and all six of the Roku Streaming Stick+ I have returned would not buy again

  I have 3 televisions and 4 different Roku units. TV #1 is used the most and is 50' from the router. TV 2 is in a bedroom about 20' from the router. TV3 is in the computer room and only 5' from the router.  The Roku 1 was our first streaming adventure on TV 1 (50'down the hallway). Our first viewing experience was a success, although Roku 1 was slow and not a great experience. Roku 1 was replaced by Roku Premier. Premier was a huge step forward with no complaints on TV1.Next up was Roku Streaming Stick for TV #2 (20' from the router). No problems at all.Feeling good about myself, I put Roku 1 on TV3 in the computer room (5' from the router). Disaster! If another TV was on, it slowed to a crawl or even a dead stop. No more reprieves - --into the trash. I took Roku Premier from TV 1 and put it on TV 3, where it's performing admirably.I put the much touted Streaming Stick Plus (fabulous reviews right?) on TV 1 (50' from the router). When it works, it is fine, but it can't seem to work for more than a few hours. Then it will drop words, stop dead, the remote may stop working, picture may to fuzzy, etc. Usually these symptoms get worse rapidly. Seldom, it returns to proper programming. If I unplug the Roku device and then plug it back in,  it will usually perform well for quite awhile.Assuming the Streaming Stick Plus couldn't be at fault (remember those great reviews?) I though about replacing my aging router. But not being a total moron, I had been checking connections, signal strength, etc all during this process. According to WIFI analyzer, my signal at TV 1 is usually around minus 62-64, which is OK. Roku settings/network is consistently 'good'. My speed test results were generally 17-25 upload and 8-11 download, which is good 'nuff. So, unless I really am missing the boat, the router signal isn't to blame.Next step will be putting Streaming Stick Plus with it's great reviews on TV3 (5' from the router) and putting Roku Premier back on TV 1. Roku 1 will sadly stay in the trash where it truly belongs. Hopefully, life will go merrily on with three functioning TVs and three different Roku units. I really love Roku for what it does - - - when it works.

  For years I was using my laptop with a HDMI cable to watch Netflix and You Tube. Recently the laptop has really been lagging or the wifi would shut off and I would have to turn the laptop off and on again (it wouldn't just let me reconnect to wifi for some wierd reason). So I finally broke down and spent $30 for this. One of the best decisions of my life!!!  (except maybe getting divorced from my ex..😁). What a life changer..plus now I have so much more to watch. Also Alexa will play music for free etc. How can you beat it?? Easy to set up and start streaming. PS my TV is 10 years old and still works with it..

  I own a Fire Stick 4K, which I like, but the UI is confusing.  The Roku stick, piece of cake.  It's super easy to set up and use.  From there, it goes downhill.I have an LG C9 OLED TV that supports all the latest and greatest video technologies.  The Fire Stick supports Dolby Vision, which looks AMAZING on my TV.  The Roku does not, and even though it supports HDR, the picture is much too bright.  Whites hurt my eyes and everything looks artificial.  Ok, so I could change my TV settings I'm sure....but that won't fix the next problem with the Roku......which is constant freezing.  My router is about 3 feet from the TV, so there's no way the signal is too weak.  No matter the app, the picture on the Roku constantly freezes.  I can watch a stream for 8-10 mins, then freeze.  Then another 8-10 mins, then freeze again.  Not to mention the remote will become unresponsive within apps, causing me to have to exit back to the home screen and restart the app.I'll keep the Roku and put on a spare TV for now, but next time Amazon has a sale on Fire Sticks, it's getting replaced.  It's a bummer because the UI is drop dead simple....but if I can't actually stream anything, what's the point?

  I have a Firestick on all my TVs. I can't find much to watch on TV from my regular provider. I shop and watch a few news programs but not much more. On my Firestick, I can download my apps and watch whatever I choose. I have many choices now. I watch Martha Stewart, YouTube, Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime so I have lots to watch when I want and where I want. I can even take my FireStick on vacation and plug it into the TV and feel like I am at home.I love the convenience of a FireStick and they only get better. Using Alexa to find the program I want to watch is wonderful.Happy viewing!

  Okay. I am 50 and not the most tech literate person.  I will say that I had a ROKU, and the difference is HUGE, to me. ROKU was much less brand centered, as you can imagine. IT is JUST a streaming stick, and I found the display format to be much simpler and easier to navigate. The Amazon stick, on the other hand, is very AMAZON-centered. And, for me, the format is much harder to navigate and understand. On Roku, Amazon had it's own separate menu like all the other streaming sites. On the Fire stick, all streaming is on an AMAZON based menu, so it is harder for me to navigate, like between the subscription sites I have purchased on Amazon and the other streaming subscription sites like Hulu or Netflix that I purchase independently.  I am sure the stick is working as it is meant to. I am just not a fan of the formatting.

  Ordered the Fire TV Stick Lite as a ""work-around"" for older VISIO smart TV.  TV's streaming capabilities were pretty limited, and had issues trying to add apps required for internet TV services.  Fire Stick solved all those problems instantly.  Device was easy to set up and is simple to use.  Set up took about 10 minutes.  Just follow concise, step-by-step instructions included in the package.  Now enjoying all Amazon Prime content (plus tons more) on primary flat screen TV.  Bargain at $30.  Recommended it to a tech-challenged neighbor couple and helped them set theirs up in minutes.  Very pleased.

  The Amazon Fire Stick works great; however, be careful where you plug this in on the surge protector since it does not provide shielding against EMI. If you plug it in next to the plug to your TV, you may notice a seizure inducing flickering. Make sure you save at least one plugin of space between your Fire Stick and TV and it should work fine. I actually bought this because I thought my other Fire Stick was broken, but on the positive side, I have a new Fire Stick. I would have given it 5 stars if it provided good shielding but it doesn't.Edit 12/26/2020 - Turns out the only way to use this device is to plug it directly into the HDMI port without the extender. The extender was the problem.

  I'm glad I purchased this. I don't have cable tv and this was able to expand the amount of tv shows and movies I can watch. The setup was easy and the controls are simple, which I am happy about because it makes it easy for my mom to use. My tv is a bit older, so I don't have apps built in. Glad I can watch stuff like Netflix on my tv now. Thinking I should've bought a fire stick sooner. I also bought a fire stick 4k, but I'm not as pleased with that one because sometimes the video freezes or it gets stuck on the menue screen. I bought the 4k, after the lite. But I wish I just bought another fire stick lite instead. The fire stick lite runs more smoothly. Also I think the remotes are too light in weight and could easily break if you drop it just once by mistake . I handle mines with extra care because I'm not trying to find out if it can easily break. But that's a minor detail

  I tried to use a 6 ft. USB extension cord to reach the wall and it just kept restarting at the opening screen over and over. Works fine without the extension. I don't know why this is the only device that has ever had a problem with a USB extension. After finding that out it's been a great addition to the entertainment set up. It brings all your streaming services under one device and even plays some fairly good games if you have a fire controller. Without a fire controller I wouldn't say it's much of a gaming device though.

  Best, user-friendly option to stream content on the market, especially for the price. Without much research, I’ve tried a half dozen products to cast or relay from my phone & this is its own stand-alone entity to convert a HDTV into a smart TV without buying another screen, when your original one fits the space & application. Couldn’t be happier, so I bought another one for the bedroom TV set. Only thing that is even remotely negative is that the back cover on the remote doesn’t lock in place very well; if you’re listening AMZN. But not enough to take away a star... maybe a 4.8 star rating.

  I couldn't get the fire stick to connect to my wifi for two days with it brand new out of the box. Did all the troubleshooting I could find on Amazon. Several resets on both the fire stick and router. I use the same wifi with my smart TV and a roku. No problems at all with my router. I contacted the support for the product. Worst ""help"" I have ever received through Amazon. The person I was dealing with had no idea what they were doing. I can understand when they have to go through all the prompts before turning it over to a tech support. But when none of it is working and I'm asking to speak to someone else, just send me on over to tech. They just had no clue at all. So frustrating when I have to repeat myself so many times over and over again in the same conversation. I did one last reset before I sent it back or just ate the money for it. It finally decided to connect to the wifi and it is working so far. I'm not liking it at all though.

  I have had several Roku's over the years.  Thought I would try a Fire Stick.  Went to down load Xfinity app.  But had to install a Down loader then make setting changes etc etc.  Finally got it installed.  Life appeared to be good.  But like all Amazon specific products you get a constant commercial on their products and then see your last visited sites then the third line is your apps.I leaned to live with this for a few weeks.  Then it said I had to up date my xfinity app and it all started over again.  Down loader etc.Stick the Fire Stick.  Ordered this Roku device. Had it up and running in 20 minutes. It even asked if I was an Xfinity Customer and downloaded the app as part of its start up, up date.  The hardest part for me was to sign in to my previously purchased apps as I had forgotten several passwords that I had chosen some years ago when I first signed up for the Apps.Roku is the best.  I am not compensated for this in any way.  I love the Roku. I must admit I did get scammed once setting up a device where I got directed to a scamer site who required a setup fee for Roku.  I paid.  This was not Roku but some scamer I got directed to.  Roku does not  charge a fee.  Remember that.

  Product worked fine, until mid-movie the other day. I have 3 Rokus, all purchased at different times. This latest one I purchased in February 2020. It lasted until August. I swapped with older Rokus on other TVs to confirm that it was this one, and not the internet connection, that was bad. I'm disappointed that the 6-month Roku support ended about 2 weeks before this issue. I would like to Roku support before buying another unit.Follow up: I could not easily navigate to follow up via Amazon on this. However, I did follow up with Roku. They said that I should do a factory reset, then send in for a replacement. I did the factory reset, then tested it and it worked, so I am not sending it in for replacement.I had originally put a 3-star, but since contacting Roku via my Roku account and getting a quick response and direction, and a willingness to replace, I have changed the rating to 5-star.  Good follow-up and service.

  WARNING!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!I bought this as a gift and my friend was scammed during set up! Instead of allowing him to set up his own account, he was told to call support since the code he logged in “didn’t work”. Not being familiar with roku he did exactly as he was told and ended up paying over $100 to be able to use the roku. The person on the other end basically held his roku hostage until he paid money, then his roku was all set up for him. He called to tell me what happened and I knew something was wrong since roku never charges to activate and set up! I did a factory reset and everything went normally after that. Now he has to watch for the charge on his credit card! Someone has preinstalled software on the roku stick to scam people. I don’t know else this would’ve gotten on the device!!!

  This device will drain batteries in a matter of days. We have replaced the batteries several times. The battery drain ranged from a few days to a few weeks. This device is not used daily, so there is no movement, nor anyone pressing buttons (Support has sent us 2 additional replacements remotes, which did not solve the problem).Buyer beware this is a faulty product. We have owned numerous Roku devices over the years, and they have been great. However, this device is faulty by design and drains batteries. We paid $50 for this. It's worthless.

  I wish I’d purchased any other streaming device. The remote is absolutely awful! It eats through batteries super quick, the batter warning flashes non-stop on the tv screen, and goes to sleep constantly. It has literally taken me 10 minutes to type in a 2 word movie title because it would go to sleep after every letter! I have tried every ‘fix’ I can find online and nothing works. Do your homework! Buy anything else! Never have I been more disappointed in an electronics purchase.

  *update*I ended up keeping this since I got it to work and... I wish I hadn't*It occasionally causes the TV to tell me that the HDMI connection isn't HDCP 2.2 so it won't play some 4K content (note that this stick plugs directly into the HDMI port so there's no cable involved. Also, it's started simply shutting down randomly and using the power button on the remote doesn't turn it back on. I need to pull the power cable and reattach it.Sure, this is only $50... but that shouldn't mean it's trash. If it was slower, fine. But random shutdowns and disconnects just means they screwed this up. Do not buy._____Original Review:Utter trash. Tried to setup apps and, since I use complex passwords, I grabbed the iOS remote app and copied and pasted the passwords. Or tried to. Although the app showed the password as having been pasted correctly, the entry on the Roku was garbled beyond recovery. Could I have just typed in these 18 digit passwords? Sure, it's tedious but you only do it once, right. And then... my TV told me the Roku was not putting out a signal anymore. Unplugged the stick, put it back in the HDMI port... it worked... for a while.Sure, this could be defective, a lemon. But this is a solid state device and it should test itself when it boots. If something is wrong, tell me. As it is, this is going in the return bag to Amazon tomorrow.

  I had the original Roku and that worked fine but didn't like using 2 remotes to still have the ability to change the volume, etc..  This new one solves that problem but the sensor is behind the TV as its part of the HDMI connection.  So sometimes I need to ""aim"" it just right.  It also takes a few minutes to load for some reason.  Same WiFi as my old set and that was quick-- this one can be spotty at times.  Jury is still out on this one.I will say-- Why can't Roku make a remote that lights up?  very annoying that in this day and age the remote doesn't simply illuminate so when watching with the lights out you can quickly find the pause button.

  ROKU makes lots of streaming devices. I have the larger ones for my home system where I want multiple input/output options.I needed one for a simple bedroom TV and decided it was time to try the stick.It plugged directly into the HDMI port. It does need a USB power supply. My TV has a USB port, but only has power when the TV is one. So, if you use the TV port, the ROKU will need to power up each time you turn on the TV. That takes about 30 seconds.It's better to use the included USB power supply, which powers the stick at all times and avoids the ROKU power up issue.Reception and streaming is great. I have had no issues. It connects to the WIFI and has every option I need.My only grief is that ROKU seems to keep adding stations to my viewing options that I have to delete. It is almost like the cell phone with all those apps you don't need, don't want, and didn't ask for.The good news is that they are easy to remove....but they seem to keep on adding more and more apps that have to be deleted.Overall, I'm very happy. Easy integration and good quality.

  Can't believe I didn't buy this years ago and was still using a Roku 1 box.I love this thing. The quality of my picture on my TV screen is a million times better and clearer. I love that it has a power button on it to turn both stick and TV off. Love having volume buttons on the remote also. And the microphone option is so much better then not having voice activity. Now I don't have to type all this nonsense anymore when I want to search for a movie. I just push the little microphone button and speak into it. I actually whispered into the other day and it still worked lol.My most favorite thing about this streaming stick is that when you scroll across a TV show or movie and stop there, it starts playing previews of that show. No more sitting through crap that I don't like anymore. I can always tell if I'll like something from a preview. So thank God for that.Worth the price and I just bought a second one for my mom.

  Recently purchased a small size projector with a small size screen projection size.  It was clunky using the cell phone to play various types of content.  This Fire Stick lite is great for the projector.  We don't need the TV controls, nor 4k quality.  Already having numerous Fire Sticks, We are very familiar with the remote control.  Nothing new to learn.Turned out a great inexpensive way to make a small inexpensive projector, a wonderful experience!  All the components are light weight, easy to carry in a bag.  Perfect for traveling!

  You have access to some free movies, and old weekly shows like Bewitched, Dennis the Menace, Johnny Carson, etc. There is a fee for all the other shows.You have to set-up a network on your your computer for WIFI for the Fire Stick to connect too unless youalready have WIFI.Images are nice and sharp.Only problem I had was that the HDMI cable would not connect properly to one of my TV's, cable end was lose fitting and I could not get a signal. I ordered a new cable male to female HDMI and will try it as soon as its delivered.

  Cut cable & saving $55 monthly eventhough YouTubeTV costs $65 monthly. Using AMZ FireTV stick is functioning well..still getting accustomed to user interface as I select local TV & streaming. TV list by time & alpha sorted stations takes some adjusting to vs. SEARCHing for TV program name. It works...just like in the ocean - which way to go - up, down or sideways.  ImDB TV offering clunky - so opting NOT to use it. AMZ FirestickTV (w/ TV button only) was/is my choice. I want to use My Samsung TV remote for other TV & peripheral equipment controls.

  This was a replacement for my first generation Fire Stick and I was disappointed with it.  I decided to upgrade as my first generation would lose connectivity.  I received the new Fire Stick Lite and for some reason it would need to be restarted every time I turned on the TV due to there being no sound.  I called and spoke to an Amazon Customer Service person who helped by sending me a replacement.  That service was amazing!  Unfortunately the second one was inconsistent too and I found the same issue.  Perhaps it didn't work with my tv?  I am returning it.

  This is my fifth fire stick we have them throughout the house. I wanted to return this and get one replaced but they kept making me talk to tech-support so I just gave up. Usually the fire sticks are amazing! But this one for some reason will not stream Hulu or Netflix it will start to and then it will cut off about a minute into it and then start the program over I don’t know what the problem is. My only other option was to return it and get a refund but I got it on sale and I’m not gonna pay 10 or 15 more dollars for the same thing that I got.

  We've been using a Roku for over a year in order to stay away from cable but decided to try out the Fire TV Stick after a lot of research. It's been about a month we started using it and we love it. It can be a little overwhelming at first due to having so many options and settings when you first set it up, but everything is very easy to figure out and gets you right into the action as soon as you are ready to watch. The picture is perfect clarity, the sound is awesome, and the connection has been perfect with no lagging. Everything you need for streaming entertainment is right at your fingertips with this inexpensive Fire Stick and we would recommend it to anyone. As far as using the remote to control the tv for on/off and volume, we have a fairly new Insignia 40"" HD tv and the remote that comes with the tv actually controls the Fire Stick as well so no need to buy the next step up.

  My husband and I got this to replace our roku that was having issues (couldn’t connect to WiFi, even though the WiFi was fine). This has been great for us with only a few things I’m not fond of.1) I’m a weirdo and I like subtitles on at all times despite not being hearing impaired - this feature in some apps doesn’t seem to stick, and I have to turn them on every time I watch something (first world problems, but inconvenient nonetheless)2) when the device “goes to sleep” it takes you all the way back to the initial page, rather than where you left off. Again, first world problems, but inconvenient.Otherwise this thing is great! And we will likely be buying another for our other tv!

  I bought this firestick to replace one that I purchased in 2017. The 2017 firestick was slow and glitchy, no matter how often I updated it and restarted it. I was about to completely give up on firestick, but thought I'd give this one a shot first. And viola, it works perfectly. I also have an Nvidia Shield that I paid $150 for. I don't play video games so the shield was way overkill. A techy friend told me to get the shield and that the firestick is crap. My techy friend was 100% incorrect. This firestick is perfect if all you are doing is watching Netflix, Hulu, Prime, YouTube, etc.

  My remote went bad. I tried new batteries and re programming. The remote would work about 5 minutes and get real hot. I had to take the batteries out. It has never been wet. It has been dropped a few times. I downloaded the fire stick app for my iPhone so I could still use the fire stick. I went to buy a new remote and the fire stick lite was cheaper than a used remote with voice. I bought a used remote without voice control for $8. I have had a Roku stick much longer than the Fire TV Stick. The remote is made much stronger. It doesn’t have voice but it still works. I bought both brands to see which one I would like. I really don’t see a big difference but the design of the remote.

  Shame on me for letting this product sit around for a couple of months before I got around to installing it.  Decided to do this on Dec 6th, 2020 on a rainy day.  Instructions make it look easy.  And it was at first.....long story short, when going through the setup of the product you enter an e-mail address that sends you an activation link.  First time failed?  Second time was a success.  Went through the process and got the congratulations page.  Sitting on the TV was the page that simply showed my e-mail th link would be sent to and a * option that gave yo the option to reset the device.  Also, it stated the link would expire in 15 minutes.  Ok. Great.  I completed the process as stated above and finished out.........now what?  Page is still shown on the TV stating it would send me a link.  Do I turn it on and turn it off.  The * option, just gave me options to reset the deive to factory defaults or restart the device.  So, I cut it off vis the power button on the remote and upon starting back up it either goes back to the page showing a link will be sent or starts the process all over again.  It's stuck in a loop.  What's worse is the website sucks too.  Go to the roku support website and it asks for the category of support needed and then the model number and...........no continue button, no page refresh for that model, nothing.  Page just looks like it was not finished by the developers.  How could it suck this bad?  Oh, and if you finally find the Roku support number you get a recording saying they no longer offer phone support due to Covid-19.  They don't offer chat support either.  Looks like I will have to choose another product to cut the cord.  Obviously for Roku to be aorund as long as they have they have got to have some good products......or just nose dived and started sucking hard on Dec 5th 2020 or somewhere around that time frame.  Anyway, that is my experience.  Still going to try a few things.  I'll post if I make progress.

THIS ROKU STICK DOES NOT EVEN GET ONE STAR.  BUT STUPID AMAZON WANTS AL LEAST 1 STAR.  GET REAL AMAZON. IF A PRODUCT DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR THAN MAYBE AMAZON DOES NOT DESERVE ONE STAR.

  1. Bad design: the stick’s form makes it impossible to connect directly to the hdmi port on my tv (which is a brand new, latest model Vizio) since the stick is too big to fit in/around  the two different locations behind the tv that have hdmi ports ......the stick is too long to get into the port/connection well behind the tv.2. Overheating : the device overheats and becomes unusable. I don’t have it in an enclosed space or on top of any other electronics....I had to get an hdmi extender and the device is  laying out in the open with plenty of air around it. Even then it becomes hot and unusable after a few days.  I have to unplug it after using it.  Also the power cord is ridiculously short - so either have to use a power cord extension or have to have it laying down/hanging near the power outlet/strip.I am very frustrated with this device. Who designed this junk?!? I’m very surprised by the absolute lack of effort and intelligence that went into this product. Don't they do any FMEA on design and alpha/beta testing?? My earlier roku was way better and well designed.

  This is the third Roku device I have bought to add to TVs in my house. They all still work and were easy to set up, however this device is unlike any other I have purchased. Although it is supposedly the same as the original Roku stick I purchased on Amazon, this one interrupts my TV streaming with Roku pop-up ads or suddenly forcing me to download a new app/channel that I don't want. Both of these interruptions close the app/channel I was using, and make me manually go back, as if I just turned it on. I don't know why this one is different, but I can't recommend it.

  That the cable they include did not fit my older TV was less of a problem than not being able to speak with customer support for two major problems. The set-up kept failing by not recognizing my WIFI, the router for which, in perfect health, sat in the same room. This went on for days while the Roku team sent me condescending emails with long lists of what I had to do to make their unreliable hardware work. I eventually solved the problem by ignoring it and trying again seven days later without doing any of the things on their long list.  As I relaxed with Netflix, the Roku CS team kept sending me emails and finally called me. Do any of you answer calls  from unknown numbers? Not enough time in the day. More email tag ensued, during which time the Roku stick again malfunctioned. Out of the blue - no one bumped into the TV stand or jostled the stick. There were no electrical surges or WIFI problems. Just cut out in the middle of a movie. Bad engineering or poor quality control, take your pick. Do they think this will motivate me to update my TV? Certainly not with one of theirs.

  I bought four of these for the various TVs in the house. Three of the four eat batteries within one or two days. I've had to resort to removing the batteries after each use.  Customer support has given me the runaround after multiple calls and chats. Last contact, they said they would escalate the problem, tech dept. would monitor my account and get back to me with a solution. Roku will not exchange the remotes or actually do anything but wear you out. I will never buy or recommend another Roku product for as long as I live. Absolute waste of money. If you get the 1 in 4 good unit, you're lucky and might actually enjoy the product.

  Beware of this Roku's remote. I brought a Roku Streaming stick Plus last year. The remote is cheaply made and stopped voice recognition after 5 months of usage and stopped working completely in less than an year. I called the Roku customer service to resolve about the remote issue and since i passed the 1 year warranty, they said they cant help me with it and asked me to buy a new remote for which i will have to shell another $30 ? If the Roku device is reset and God forbid the remote stopped working the whole unit becomes useless, as in my case.I would never trust another Roku device and will never buy one either when they can't even get their remote work properly, which malfunction within a year !

  I bought 3 of these to replace Xfinity DTA boxes that I was being charged a monthly fee to use.  I love that it is so small and plugs directly into my TV's HDMI input, and is neatly concealed behind the set.  I've been using this for a month now, and on one of them, about once a week, I turn on my TV and the screen is blank.  The ROKU device does not boot up as normal.  So, I need to unplug the device and then re-insert it, which then leads me into the process of the original setup, which requires selecting the wifi network, entering the wifi password, entering my email address, retrieving a passcode, name the device, and then the device uploads all of the services.  Then,  to get the Xfinity beta stream to work again, I need to go tot their website and re-authorize the device.  This whole process takes about 15 minutes.  This doesn't seem normal, and I think there is something wrong with the device. I will reach out to ROKU and see if they can address the issue.  The others seem to be working just fine.  If Roku can address this for me, I will revise my rating.

  I have had this device since black friday nov 2017.  The stick works well for streaming 4k content... but someone explain to me why their are ads on the landing page?  About 4 months ago the remote started chewing through batteries. I tried the HDMI extender.  No good.  Looks like the remote has a short.  They will not replace the remote because the warranty has expired.  Except they won't tell me how long the warranty lasts.Shrug.  So now i have a stick but no remote.short version is this is made extremely cheaply.  Expect to buy a new one every year or two.  Not a bad deal for $45 on black Friday.When it was working it worked well enough.  The voice search only works for paid channels and not for Plex.  The Alexa integration was only okay.

  This is my fourth Roku (the oldest one finally died after many (8?) years, and this one is an upgrade from a conventional 1080 Roku Stick).  Didn't have any of the problems with registration highlighted by another reviewer.  My old Roku Stick connected just fine through the streaming box HDMI input of my Onkyo 4K capable AV receiver to my old Sharp 1080 TV, but when I upgraded to a Samsung 4K TV,  the new TV didn't recognize the video signal from the old Roku Stick when it passed through the AV receiver.  (Note:  the old Stick worked fine connected directly to a HDMI port on the new TV).  Anyway, I decided to get a 4K Roku Stick+ to match the resolution of the new TV.  As a bonus, the Stick+ works fine passing the video signal through the AV receiver to the new TV.  Unfortunately, with this configuration, the Stick+ remote control does NOT control the TV power and volume (no surprise there), but I'm confident it would work if I connected the Stick+ directly to a HDMI port on the new TV.  However, in my set-up, the TV is wall-mounted so it's ""cleaner"" to use the AV receiver as the ""command center"" for all the HDMI video inputs by placing peripherals (AV receiver, blu-ray, boxes, etc.) on an adjacent shelf/table and use a single cable from the AV receiver to send the selected video signal to the TV.Bottom line, the Roku Stick+ provides an upgrade in video resolution to match my new TV, and also solves the problem of passing the Roku video signal through the AV receiver to the TV.  5 stars.

  In my experience, based on two different Roku models, the Ultra and this one the Streaming Stick +,  The Ultra is fine, no problems, but this one, Streaming Stick +, is a different experience. The problem is with the Remote Control. This Remote Control drain the batteries extremely fast, brand new they last a week with less than a week of use, it is unbelievable, and this happens with Duracell batteries.. DO NOT BUY this Stick

  I got this Roku Streaming Stick+ to replace my Fire TV Stick 4K as I have a lot of friends who swear by Roku and it's collection of apps. Well, bottom line up top here is that The Fire TV Stick 4K is a superior device. So just buy it instead unless you really love Roku.The Roku does seem to have lots of additional things you can add such as obscure channels and things, but I mainly use these things:Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO GO/MAX, Apple TV App, CNN, NBC News, and YouTubeBoth Roku and Amazon Fire TV have all of these apps and they work essentially the same on both so as far as actual content is concerned it's pretty much the same.Things I noticed about the Roku that I did not like:- Roku requires you to signup with a separate ""Roku Account"" in order to use the device. I assume this is so they can target ads to you across multiple streaming platforms. This isn't much different from having to login to the Fire TV with your Amazon account, but in this case Roku doesn't really provide you any content (compared to Amazon where you are logging in so you can access Prime Video).- The Roku HDMI control and remote had a lot of issues controlling my TV. Many times things would end up in a state of the Roku being on but the TV being off, or vice versa. With the Fire TV Stick the HDMI control seems perfect and the remote always turns the TV on and off properly.- The Roku interface seems a little dated and kludgy. I am not a fan of the way the menus wrap back to the beginning but that will vary by person. The Fire TV interface just seems a lot cleaner and better organized.- Roku seems to insert a lot more ads into shows. I wasn't aware that this was a thing until I compared the two devices. For instance, if I watch the NBC Nightly News on my Fire TV Stick 4K I see one commercial at the very beginning of the news and that's it. When the anchor says ""We'll be right back"" there is no commercial and it just fades right back in to the next news segment. On the Roku watching the exact same NBC Nightly News I get a commercial at the beginning, but then during every commercial break segment (""We'll be right back"") I get 4-6 commercials which adds a significant amount of time to watching the news. This alone is worth going with the Fire TV in my book.- Remote - The Roku remote places the volume controls along the right edge of the remote instead of on the main face of the remote like most other remotes. I much prefer having the volume on the main portion of the remote instead of on the side.- Boot up time - Every time I turn on the Roku it takes maybe 15-30 seconds to turn on while a Roku logo animation plays on the screen. The Fire TV Stick 4K starts up much faster.- Dolby Vision - With the Fire TV Stick 4K it seems that the output is always locked to Dolby Vision as my TV displays the Dolby Vision logo as soon as the Fire TV turns on. With the Roku it seems that maybe Dolby Vision is only output when necessary and I've noticed that sometimes this results in the Roku menu appearing either bright or dark depending on what the last output mode was. I like the consistency of the Fire TV Stick 4K output better.All in all the Roku is not a ""bad"" device per se, but I think for the price you are much better off with the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K. I ended up selling my Roku and buying another Fire TV Stick 4K.

  Update... I went and bought my own HDMI male-female cord because Roku was so backordered. Went and got it all set up and it's a nightmare to stream from my iPhone (with audio and video). My son has a Chromecast on his projector and it's so much easier. In retrospect, that's what I should have gotten. So I gave 1 star before, and they deserve another reduction in stars but I can't go below 1 star. Definitely recommend against Roku... (And I used to be a fan from the Roku 3 that I bought many, many years ago...)Here's my prior review:This thing can't fit into the space of my Vizio TV. It's nuts that they design this hard plastic item that is fairly big to fit into the tight space behind my TV. They offer a free extender which is backordered until April 30. My Amazon window for returns expires April 28, so I'm going to have to return it because I won't know if it works until after the return window. Can't begin to explain how frustrated and disappointed I am.Awful design.

  I purchased this item a year ago and gave it 5 stars at the time--mainly for picture quality and improvements over their original model. But Roku has now lost me as a customer. After a year of their ridiculous channel selection system (about a dozen clicks to get from start screen to a program), I tried to watch a program tonight on CBS All Access (now Paramount+) and found Roku had logged me out of that channel. The device/system would not accept my account and password for that channel, even though it works on the new Paramount+ website. I went to Roku.com to advise them of the problem, and I hit the wall they'd built to avoid their customers. After selecting the closest non-relevant option they offered, I got this message--for a device I bought just a year ago! ""Agent-assisted support is not available for your issue and/or model."" Roku offers no online support other than ""ask the community,"" no option to e-mail them--just nothing. How do they expect to learn about problems with their system if they close their door to communication from customers?

  I got this because even though my TV has built-in Netflix and some other things, it doesn't have YouTube or Funimation, so I had been using the PS4 apps for those, and they're not good. The Roku version of the Funimation app is much better. If you only need the biggest streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.) then most TVs seem to come with those already these days. But Roku is pretty good for smaller channels.My main gripe is the fact that they sell positions on the quick buttons to various companies/channels, and you as the consumer have zero control over which buttons you get. Mine came with Disney Plus, Netflix, Sling, and Hulu. If you don't actually use the apps on the buttons, those buttons are just wasted and annoying. You can't even see which buttons any individual remote will have when you buy it (they rotate, but it's pure chance what you'll get). I just really hate buying a product and then having part of *my* possession sold as ad space for a company I may or may not want to support or have any interest in. Roku offers a version that has programmable buttons--but it's the most expensive version, it's only two buttons, and those are *in addition to* the four buttons that they sell as ad space. I wish Roku would focus more on their customers than their vendors/business partners and instead put the ad buttons only on the very cheapest model or as a cheaper version of each model (so you get a discount for agreeing to see the ads) and just make all four buttons programmable by the user as the default.

  I am wondering why when I try and play two specific apps, The Roku Channel and 4k Spotlight my stick just quits and the screen says NO INPUT DETECTED. Every thing else works fine, MLBTV NFLGAMEPASS, NHLTV, but when it comes to Roku channel and 4k spotlight it just shuts off, I have great internet speed and a 4k TV 2018 model LG 55”. I have looked online for answers and Roku is like looking for Bigfoot when it comes to answers, I’m not sure if I have a faulty stick, a month old or what. I have to decide quickly as the time to return it free of charge is winding down. My AppleTV 4k works fine on everything, why not this stick, did they not include a 4k connection adaptable for hdcp 2.2? Be aware when you buy for this problem if 4k is what you seek and Roku channel issues. Frustrating trying to get answers. Otherwise it has been good for me. The 4k works fine when it works.

  As a long time fire tv user, it was time to make a switch after my Fire TV box died after 3 years.  I tried the Fire Stick 4k, but after it trying to complete updates for 4 hours, I decided to return it.  Boy am I glad I did.  The set up on the Roku is way simpler.  I like that the home screen just shows apps, rather than the Fire TV interface which bombards you with ads.  I like that the home screen can be customized and reorganized while the Fire TV had different screens you had to navigate through to find certain channels.  I did have to toy around with it, plugging it into different HDMI ports to get the best configuration, but that is more on my TV than the Roku.  My only issue with it is that you have to use the power USB cable that it comes with and it is not too long, but I plan on buying an USB extension cord, as I prefer it to be plugged into an outlet.  If you are debating between the Fire TV and this, buy this.  I am a devoted Amazon user, but this product is worth every penny!

  #3 Review:  6/3/20  Roku is not operating again.  Sometimes it does, other times it doesn't.  The problem is with getting Prime video to work with Roku. Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  Neither Roku nor Prime Video really do anything about this.  it is very hard to suggest this disappointment to anyone else#2 Review: Wrote 5 emails on May 2 to tech support re: the Roku did not work.  Received non-robotic email reply on May 6.  But they had not read my emails, b/c they provided me with alternative ways to ""power on the device"", and that was not the problem. Today, I have emailed back asking them to please my 5 emails to them on May 2.#1 Review: Was very excited to get this. I have made it through most of the stages of set up, but nothing is working.  The setup instructions are terrible -- not very clear at all.  I did exactly as was said and kept getting error messages, even though Roku showed there was a good connection with the Internet. The tech support at the Roku website is very poor -- only written so that the only people who can understand are those who don't need to. And, to top it off, Roku offers effectively NO tech support.  The only option is emailing requests for help, but those are only answered robotically by a machine, promising help (when?).If I had known that all the advertising indicating that the setup was  simple, but it is actually very complex, or confusing, or just doesn't work, I would not have bought this.  I am still waiting for tech support to help me get it working

  I strongly advise against buying this streaming stick.  I replaced my older Roku stick with this SS+ thinking it will be faster while also having a stronger Wifi antenna.  When I first installed it I was not disappointed.  It worked great...for about 2 weeks.  Out of nowhere it would not play a single video from any streaming service, displaying a ""HDCP error"" and advising me to unplug it and plug it back in.  Well that didn't work.  I did a 'system reset'.  Nope.  I changed the display type and dropped the resolution down to 780p.  Nope.  It even said HDCP compliant on the display type!  I went to the Roku forum and saw hundreds of other customers having the exact same problem - it worked for a while and then suddenly the HDCP error out of nowhere.  Some said it would go away for a while and then come back intermittently.  For many others like myself nothing worked.  I sense there is a firmware issue that Roku refuses to acknowledge.  Customers called into Roku only to be disconnected.  They said the customer service was horrible.  I'm returning it and buying the Amazon Stick.  Until Roku admits and addresses the problem I am done with them.  This is a big black eye for Roku.

  1) The streaming seems flawless on this device - and on the ""ultra"", which I purchased first.2) There is a dizzying number of channels, and except for the movies at the apple store, you essentially get all the channels found on apple.3) Subscription for YouTube TV is $50 when you use the YouTube TV app in Roku. I'm told it is $55.00 if you subscribe to YouTube TV on Apple TV; you pay Apple $60.00 extra bucks per year - the price of a good Roku device.4) However, some areas are significantly less developed than others. It has excellent connectivity, and streaming, programming are great. But even though it’s been around for many years, it has some frustrating interface problems.a) You cannot setup any of the device parameter from your computer. On the other hand, Apps and individual channels allow you to setup setup online, and the settings are preserved from one Roku device to the other. An example is YouTube TV and PBS.b) On your computer, you can select Roku channels/apps and your work will apply to to all the devices. But you cannot setup any particular sequencing for the icons. You can sequence them on a device, but Roku doesn't let you share that sequencing on other devices. For example, if you want YouTube TV at the top, followed by Netflix, you must separately rearrange the icons on each device.c) The buttons on the remote are not programmable. If you don't want a subscription to Netflix, why should a button devoted to Netflix be in your face all the time? why should you be subjected to the risk of pressing the button in the dark? Roku's solution to accidental button presses is to ask: ""are you sure you want to exit whatever you're watching?"" - but this addresses a totally different problem. THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO DEFEAT THESE BUTTONS OR TO PROGRAM THEM AS YOU WISH. Netflix pays money to Roku for this, but Roku subjects the customers to frustration, as they are likely to press the button my mistake and then have to go through several steps in order to get out of, for example, Netflix.Still and all, I think Roku is every bit as good as Apple TV. Roku's most expensive device, during discounts times, is less than half the price of Apple TV.

  Roku is simply the best system on the market.  FireTV and AppleTV are fine and solid performers, but Roku's open system still provides access to the widest range of programming outside of the wire based cable world.  The setup process was easy enough that my six year old grandson had the system up and running in ten minutes.  Voice commands work well and the range is greater than anything I will ever be able to take advantage of in my home.  I can stream 4K programming without any skipping or lag (keep in mind that this is dependent upon your own wireless network speed). So, you have a low cost way to expand your entertainment network by literally thousands of options.  What's not to like?  The only problem you will encounter is figuring out what to watch next.

  I have now put in three sets of batteries after the set it came with since getting this in October.  Thought it might have just been a couple bad batteries, but finally put them into my TVs remote and all of them work perfectly fine there.  Very disappointing because the device itself is great.

  Device works well.  But when mine failed, I discovered that Roku Customer Service is terrible.  They have no phone support.  So support must be done via Chat.  The back-and-forth was endless.  It took much too long to explain the situation and get the representative to offer a replacement device.  Chat dropped twice during dialogue and I had to start again from scratch.  Roku requires return of defective product *before* they will send a replacement.  Turnaround time is at least a week without the device.  The customer is on the short end of the Roku (Streaming) Stick.

  We mainly bought this because Disney+ wasn't available on our Vizio smart TV.The good: 4k picture is great, the apps are pretty smooth, the remote works without having line of sight, the search function is fantastic, where I can just search on Roku and it will show me where the show is available and how much it costs to rent or buy.The bad: Amazon Prime only works for about 30 minutes before I start getting the ""device is overheating"" warning, which is weird because it rarely happens with other apps (probably more of a critique of Amazon Prime). There's a long delay after the Roku powers up until the remote starts working (it's like it's frozen for 10-20 seconds). For the first month we would sometimes lose audio entirely and have to restart. ESPN app didn't have audio at all while we tried to use it. Not sure if that ever got fixed.If I could go back I'd probably spend more money and just get an Apple TV.

  Never used a Roku stick before but I wanted to cut cable. It was insanely easy to install and setup. A keyboard definitely would make the sign in process easier but I was able to proceed anyways.I didn’t like that you have to think about what you want to watch. With cable you flip it on and find something  interesting. I have gotten used to it though and have found some really great shows on Hulu. Nothing is Live. If I want Live the Hulu Live is an additional 54.99 per month. If I want News I guess Pluto is the way to go. With the Roku stick and streaming you can definitely binge on specific shows. In fact I over binged as I didn’t know how to change channels at first ( top arrow to left pulls up guide )Unfortunately I was unable to cut my cable completely. I added spectrum TV. I love love love it. I had direct TV prior and was paying about $300 per month for internet plus satellite tv. Crazy! With the roku stick on 2 of my TVs ... I have A spectrum DVR and cable on the main tv ( instant tv:)) and the spectrum tv app on the other 2.( a 4th tv has the Xbox one which can download the spectrum app). I still have Hulu for $5 a month . My total now is about $200. The Roku sticks have definitely helped me cut down on my tv entertainment bills. They are really easy to use for someone who isn’t tech savvy. They are portable since you create a Roku account ( free) and plug them into the hdmi spot on The TV. You can either plug them into a wall outlet or the usb tv port for power. They also act as the digital box you need to rent from your cable company if your TV isn’t smart.I feel that the Roku stick has allowed me to get closer to my goal of cutting cable completely. They are definitely user friendly:) Five stars Roku!!

  I ordered this stick to get rid of cable and as I’m setting the stick up , I had to call Roku to set it up with the code and they wanted to charge money to have their services! Wtf it was never mentioned that I need to pay for their services to work the Roku stick , one I don’t have the money and 2 it was never mentioned anywhere while purchasing these device saying I would have to pay them to be able to use the rocku Stick . So has anyone else have to pay to use rocku ? This is unbelievable and I read everyone reviews on here before I bought the stick and no one ever mentioned this so do you have to pay lots of money to use this device?

  I happen to get my first ROKU about a year back at Home Depot. It sat on the shelf for 6 months until I was at a location with high speed internet before I attempted to use it but since then, I have grown to use it with more and more appreciation each time.The first thing I did was to sign up for CBS All Access ($10US/mo) and I had Amazon Prime. The picture quality is definitely HD and as good or better than satellite HD with the upside that so many ""channels"" are available of my own choosing. There is a lot of free material available outside any subscriptions and beside the subscriptions, there is one-time buy offered on those things you really want. There is no charge for ROKU services and ROKU bills any charges through the provider you choose (simple set-up for each). After that, it's just like punching into a channel. On top of that, the ROKU Streaming Stick + offers voice recognition so you can search for things using voice prompts and ROKU is very good at it (actually excellent). If an old movie (or other video content) is available, ROKU can find it using a voice prompt. YouTube works the same way and voice prompting saves a lot of typed in requests for searching. I had very rare glitches on a 1.5MB/s internet connection, and none on my home 3MB/s service (though not using any other device at the time) - just rock-solid video and audio.In summary, I would recommend this item to anyone interested in streaming programming and feel it is a great deal for the low cost it is offered at.

  So, I ordered a new Roku stick for my new TV. When I got the package, it appeared unopened, but when I went to do the setup, I didn't have to do all the steps I had to do with my previous Roku devices (pairing the remote, logging in, downloading apps, etc). I thought it was odd, but just figured that since I hadn't done it in awhile, things had changed. Then I went to the Netflix app. Lo and Behold, there was someone else's sign in, and credentials. Same with Amazon Prime. It appears that I got a return and it wasn't restored to the factory settings. So, not only did I get a retuned unit, I got one that had personal info on it.I did reset the unit to the original condition, then signed in to all the apps using my credentials. The unit works fine, and I do not plan to return in case this this happens  to someone else.Pretty bad form by Roku.

  I bought a projector for outside but needed a way to show cable shows, Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime video. I bought Amazon Fir Stick and it was easy and great but did not support Xfinity app unless you download a third party app. I then learned Roku supports them all. Bought this Roku stick and set-up was very easy and fast. All the streaming channels I have subscriptions with work and I have access to Xfinity cable so Cubs canes and HBO and other movies are accessible. Wonderboom Bluetooth speaker works but perfectly but had to figure out link it through phone first and then in Roku app click the headphones symbol for private audio and sound cane out speaker for movie. I’m now returning Amazon fire stick which is ironic bc I love Amazon and almost never return any purchases and I buy a lot of stuff and the one thing I return is their product. Weird.

  Its a great piece of equipment and no other can beat it on price. If you have Netflix or Apple TV, you can log it in and it works great. My complain is more about Amazon Prime and its geographic limitations. Im using this outside of the US and there is an insane amount of content the is not licensed and you simply cannot watch it. That is a disappointment given that all this services are used where? On the world wide web! Access could be anywhere right? Funny but true. After two months, Im cancelling Amazon Prime Video as its annoying to sort out what to watch given all this restricted content.

  Don’t need to control your TV and want a fire stick? This is literally it. It is pretty much the same as the 4K version in terms of speed, and I use this on my projector since the fire stick won’t be able to control it even if I want it to. Everything else is the same, and it is cheaper than the 4K version. I am thinking of setting a projector up in the basement too, so may grab another one of these for that. This is 100x better than roku sticks for a projector. Trust me, this is the way if you want to turn into projector into an entertainment powerhouse!

  I bought this for a friend who doesn't have a smart TV, but owns two homes.  She can take this with her to her mountain cabin or use it down here in So LA county.  I haven't been able to give it to her yet because of Covid, but I'm sure she will find it useful.  I got it for her on black Friday when it was super cheap.  But when buying one of these for yourself, but the more expensive one that can control your TV as well.  This friend isn't that into TV, but she does like to watch YouTube religious videos, so this will work for her.

  Bought it to use with the older TV....  almost bought another TV figuring the loss of sound must be a TV problem.  Turns out the new firestick is the reason the sound occasionally disappears and you have to reboot the firestick by unplugging it.  Previous version was loosing network connection in a similar manner.  Probably some sort of power saving features in the software that is not waking things up correctly.  Either way.  If you are looking for something, that just cheap and basic and works out of the box look somewhere else.

  At $17.99, this seems like a STEAL.  Has all the functionality of a regular HD FireStick with the exception of the ability to control the TV (on/off, volume up/down/mute) with the Firestick Lite remote.  If you can live without those features on the Firestick Lite remote, then this is a great buy.  Also, since this is part of Amazon's latest release of Fire TV products, I already got the software update to the new Fire TV interface, while my older Fire TV devices have not (coming in a few months to the older devices apparently).

  I bought this FireStick Lite because I wanted to binge The Mandalorian on my TV rather than on my puny computer screen - but my TV was too old to get apps and my usual pathway to WiFi, a blu-ray player, kept removing apps from its available lineup and also was incompatible for Disney+.  Give me Fire!It streams Netflix better than my blu-ray ever did (just streams better overall really), gives me Disney+, and enables me to get a bunch of apps to watch a slew of TV shows and movies.  With its low price, it's been a bargain.

  The firestick lite is an inexpensive way to provide streaming services to lesser used tvs in your home. It has a great number of apps available to install and if you have cable it might be a means to eliminate a cable box. Another plus is the remote which eliminates the need to use your phone to play the apps. Only issue I've experienced is that some buffering issues have occurred with some of the apps. I've used an ethenet adapter to resolve this problem. I haven't used Alexa with it enough to judge how well it works with it.

  Initially I was pleased with the Firestick lite.  It was easy to set up but now I find when I try to connect to Fire TV there are problems with connecting to the internet.  I need to restart the Firestick one or more times before I can get the home screen. It requires a good bit of fooling around to get to Prime and is a bother.  The problem is not with my internet but with the Firestick.  I have not encountered this issue with my older Firestick.  I don't know if I have a bad unit or if it is a problem with the version of the Firestick.  I would not recommend the Firestick Lite.

  3 stars because it works well when it’s properly functioning. The stick was working fine for the first 2 months, until a couple weeks ago it has been acting up. Once The Fire Tv Stick is turned on after being off there is no sound. Seems to be a recurring issue for other users as I was able to find a temporary resolution. I have to disconnect it and reconnect it DAILY.

  After a lot of procrastination, we finally ""Cut the Cord"" and dumped our satellite provider. We signed up for YouTube TV and love it. With this Amazon Firestick, we have access to a lot more content and mobility. We now have three firesticks and each works very well. I was particularly pleased with how easy the setup was. And even more surprised that it was instantly compatible with a 14-year-old Visio 32"" flat-screen TV.  I am also pleased that that old TV still works perfectly. I will probably get one more for the RV.

  I bought this unit to test if I can use it as an additional cable outlet as opposed to renting and additional box from my cable provider. This proved to be a good experiment as all you need to do is download the appropriate apps for the channels you want to watch and login to them (a one time operation) using your cable providers credentials. If using this way you need to make sure you are subscribed to these channels with your cable provider ahead of time. You can also use without a cable provider but then would need to subscribe to each channel you want to see which could be more cost effective.

Everytime when the TV is off. The device is off too. When I turn the tv but the device won't turn on automatically.  I can't turn it on with remote control either.

  I have a $200 AppleTv and this.  For the money I will probably stick with the Fire stick from here on out.  I admit the AppleTv seems slightly speedier and more refined.  However, for the price this Fire stick is really hard to beat.  One thing I’ll say is that if you have a lot invested in a Vudu account this is absolutely not for you.  That app is not available.  Most of my stuff has been synced over movies anywhere though, so I’m good.  I can live with it only being available on my other premium streaming box.

  Update: Amazon contacted my right after posting but could not help me. The stick just doesn’t work right with the app. Also, I got this new one because it’s got a much faster processor, but the new OS (which sucks) must be dragging it down because it’s slower than my old one.Replaced my 4 year old fire tv box with this stick. I use the app a lot to control the fire tv but this new one doesn’t connect to the phone more than half the time! The old one was much more reliable.Also, they asked for a rating on the volume control and there is none!

  This works as well as the other Firesticks but doe not have TV power/volume integration, and that's fine if you are trying to save a couple bucks.I do ding these one star because the stick itself never turns off, and as with most computing devices they need to be powered down occasionally.  If you want to restart it you have to go through a series of menu selection until you get to the reboot screen.  Just give us the option to let it sleep or power down when you hit the power button.

  Thank goodness everything was wrapped in plastic because the batteries had leaked everywhere. I wasn’t sure the plug would work since they were right next to them. Curious why the batteries themselves weren’t wrapped when everything else was since they’re the potential damaging component in the package. Also, I didn’t need the dongle due to my hdmi being at an angle, I had to use it because the stick is too wide for standard-distance placement between hdmi ports. So I’m glad it came in the package. They could have easily avoided this in design by making the stick narrower and longer.

It has better functionality, is faster, and has better on-screen layout than the older model.  I like it so much that I bought one for my daughter and son-in-law as a gift during the holidays.  They both enjoy using their Firestick TV with Alexa.. I highly recommend Firestick to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it.

  Works well with my older Samsung TV that has outdated apps that no longer work. It was really easy to install all of the apps I use (Netflix, Hulu, ESPN, Disney+). I found instructions online to download HBO max as well. The only drawback is that the fire stick wasn’t able to get enough power through the USB outlet in my TV. I had to run an extension cord with a splitter up behind my TV to plug in through the USB adapter so that my cords were still hidden. Overall, it’s a great value to access streaming apps. I recommend getting one for every TV.

  We have a 10-year old non-smart TV. It still has good pictures and sound, so it was worth finding an inexpensive solution to get it online. We looked into the original Fire TV Stick but it didn't support YouTube TV. Fortunately, the new one does, and it works great. Set-up took about 5 minutes, and then maybe another 5 to register with Netflix and YouTube TV Prime Video pops up right away. Alexa integration is good (""Play videos by Ike and Tina Turner."")For the money, I don't think you can go wrong.

  I've gone back and forth between Roku and Amazon Fire TV Sticks and I'm leaning to the Fire TV Stick. I do think the Roku interface is better. The Fire TV Stick plays on integrated content with your Amazon account so if you're fully invested in Amazon services, the Fire TV stick is a better option. What tips the scale for me however is the ability to integrate 3rd party apps like TiviMate and various IPTV type services. Roku still has no good answer for that and if you're cutting the cord with your cable provider, Amazon is a better choice.

  I'm a big fan of the Amazon FireStick. It's a great streaming device. Lots of content, easy to set up and use, affordable -- it's terrific. However, if you already have a FireStick 2nd Gen, it's not worth upgrading to the new one. I saw that this new stick had a faster processor, so I upgraded and it IS faster, but not enough to make it worth the $40. If you're moving up to the 4K model, then, yes, it's a good upgrade (if you have a 4K TV). But it's not enough faster than the 2nd Gen to make it a smart decision to upgrade.

  I purchased two of the Roku Stick + units, having the same problem with both.The remote and unit frequently lose the ability to connect and I find myself taking the batteries out of the remote in order to control the Stick.I have been a Roku supporter since they first came out many years ago, this is the most frustrating unit yet.When it works, it works well, but you cannot depend on being able to use it without frustration.I purchased a Roku Ultra and I am very pleased.My recommendation, skip the Stick + and buy an ultra or a Roku 3 if you can find one.

  The setup was awful and it forces you setup a Roku account and insert credit card info. Luckily you can go into your account on a computer and remove the credit card, but that is not cool at all.You can't connect to any Bluetooth devices, unless it is Roku specific products. Lame.The ads on the main screen are pretty annoying. The main reason I got this was to get away from the Amazon excessive self advertising on their FireStick, but this isn't a whole lot better. Really annoying when we pay for these things.The remote works fine but I don't care for the volume and mute being on the side, is just awkward and annoying. I thought I would get used to it, but I haven't.The only good thing is it performs pretty well and streaming quality looks very good. I also like that I can search for a TV show or movie and get a list of services it is on and the price - FireStick doesn't do that.Overall, meh... I'm about ready to just get a PC on a stick and put Linux on it, get a mouse/keyboard remote, and be done with this crap.

  Well compared to my Roku ultra and myRoku express. This stream stick is garbage. My tv doesn’t see it and this stream stick is running really hot. And amazon tech support wants me to wait and see. Nope not going to mess up my new 55 inch lg tv. I am going to send this thing back. And if they give me any crap. I am shopping elsewhere. Amazon customer support has degraded lately. Sad. I just want to send this defective product back. Get something that works.

  Love Roku and decided to upgrade my dad's Roku to go with his 4K tv and I thought the stick would be easier, more convenient. I have the Roku 3 and it's great. I realize this may sound ridiculous but I didn't think it would have to have cords attached (I'm so sick of cords everywhere!), but I should've just got the other Roku for 4K...I still would've had cords but not the problem I encountered with this one. I can't stand the design on this one. The way the cord plugs into the stick, it's on the top of the stick and hangs down around the top instead of plugging into the bottom of the stick. The result is, it pulls on the stick, which kept creating a loose connection with the port. It was a real pain and I thought a bad design. Because of that we constantly were getting the purple screen. Next time I'll skip getting the stick type.

  I had an old Roku and didn't realize it was the reason my sling TV was super slow to change channels, always buffering, and my TV remote was useless to change the volume. I always blamed it on the internet. I literally had to set the volume I wanted, turn off the TV and turn it on again. What a disaster. Not sure why it didn't occur to my little pea brain sooner, but I thought maybe I should upgrade my Roku. So happy I did. It's been a game change for my nightly TV watching routine. Everything moves fast, and the single remote can now turn on and off the TV AND control the volume. This has been life changing.

  Roku has come a long way since I last used one many years ago. This thing is a just a stick yet it performs well. My favorite surprise feature was when I realized I could use the Roku app on my iPhone and iPad to send the audio to my AirPod pros (or whatever headphones you happen to be using with your phone/tablet) and use the noise cancelling features of my AirPods which is great.  The streaming quality is superb. Navigating the interface isn’t super speedy but it’s not sluggish either.Another plus of this stick is its ability to use hotel and dorm Wifi. I couldn’t manage to get my chrome cast device to work with hotel Wifi because of the sign-on page the hotel uses, but it was pretty easy using this stick and my iPhone/iPad. I’m not sure if it would be possible if you don’t have a smart phone or tablet with you.

  There are a ton of options for streaming on line. Recently my Samsung big screen smart system died & it's crazy expensive to fix. But, the TV itself still worked great & I can connect it to my laptop (but this is a huge PITA). I also have a small TCL model 6 in the bedroom and really love it's Roku platform. So, I decided to try this streaming stick before I said F'it and just buy another big screen (which seems like a waste when the TV still works). I'm glad I did!The Roku stick connects great & works flawlessly! I really like the voice feature on the Roku. And it has IMO the easiest to use interface. I'd totally buy this again! And for around $40 bucks, it fixed a $1000 TV. Yay!

  I bought this because I thought it was just a USB stick that plugs in to your TV. What it actually is, is a stick that plugs in to your hdmi port but still needs a charger! You still have to find a way to stretch this tiny cord to an outlet, directly from the stick plugged in to the back of the tv. Which means not only do I still have cords to deal with, I can't even hide them as well as the old Roku (which already did not work well). They stick directly out the side of my tv (the cord won't reach if I plug it into the back of the tv).It also did not allow me to skip the ""option"" of having the roku remote control the tv power and volume, which I absolutely do not want.Roku somehow made a WORSE product than the defunct one I was trying to replace.

  So I have a 5 year old LG TV and a separate sound system. The TV does not control sound through the optical port out for my sound system (just outputs max line level volume always then set my amplifier to a reasonable level). Currently I have a mini computer, which I can control the sound through my wireless keyboard. Therefore the Roku, while it controls the TV sound is unable to control the output to my sound system. Called tech support and they said my TV is too old, although it's not that old... Don't see why the roku can't just control the sound out from the HDMI like a computer can, maybe it takes too much extra electronics. Also, I can't buy a receiver with IR and control it from the remote either because it's only programmed with TV IR codes for some reason (it specifically says cannot control AVR in setup...), seems like another thing they could have added... Either way it doesn't work so I'll either return it or get a pass through line level volume controller with it's own remote, not ideal but it might work.

  The wifi connected remote NEVER worked properly from day 1.I ordered the longer dongle, which made ZERO difference - and also a new remote; same story.I found an odd work-around out of frustration, by simply pushing on the remote buttons repeatedly until the remote finally connected with the device, and that lasted for a year.Now, almost a year to the date of purchase, NEITHER of my two remotes will connect, and neither will my iphone using the ROKU app.My tech level knowledge I'd rate at 7 out of ten, and I know how to manipulate my wireless router to allow for different masking and sub-categories relevant to setup of this device.  All attempts have failed, and I am positively TIRED of looking for workarounds.I will attempt to get ROKU to rectify this situation.  Like I said, this is a good unit WHEN it works.I do like the wireless remote, but it is THE weak point of this system.As info I have an older basic Roku unit that is nearly 8 years old, and it still works flawlessly in a separate room, on an older tv.  Makes me wonder if I should have purchased another one of THOSE instead of the Streaming Stick Plus??I like the speed of this unit, and the menus are intuitive and functional - better than the onboard android OS on my Sony Bravia TV.I do on occasion, also experience the Dual-Screen ""green-out"" anomaly that others have reported as well. But that is an easy fix with a simple restart.I dont think I'd buy THIS particular unit again - but I do like ROKU.Support online has been mediocre to this point, and it took jumping through some hoops and a few nasty emails to get them to send me a new dongle and remote at the beginning of this year long journey.

  Am sick and tired of the cable companies and their pricing. But am not going to go into that here. These Roku units have helped us sever the cords and we are not turning back. We got the voice recognition due to the fact that we were hoping for a better search feature. Its ok but not great. The Roku device does provide for a affordable way to watch TV. Multiple channels. and of course if you're not careful you can run up the monthly bill. We are still finding channels that we like. Only complaint so far is the speed seems slow even though we have pretty good (GB) internet. But its a fair trade off for the money we will save.

  I got a Roku TV and love it so now I'm getting rid of a cable box and replacing the firestick with a Roku. The main issue with the firestick is it's not compatible with the Spectrum channel and I really need to have that. Plus now all my devices are on the same format. Add a channel to one and they all have it. Set up was pretty simple. I have a Roku TV and two Roku sticks. Not sure what some reviews were talking about having to pay a registration. I didn't have to pay anything extra to have 3 devices on my account.The devices work well, no issues using the remote. The remote is super easy to sync to the TV so you can operate the volume and power. Just go to set up, music plays, when the music stops, hit the button. The Roku TV is better than the stick as it starts up right away and seems a bit more responsive so while this works great, getting Roku built into the TV is even better.So I guess that's my only con to this, it does take half a minute to get started watching something. Also wish it could navigate the guides a bit faster. It would be nice if I could just speak the channel number while on the Spectrum guide but it tries to take me to another app/channel.

  If you're watching 4K video the stick will overheat very easily. Luckily, I have 3 HDMI ports on the back of my 4K tv. I had to move the stick from HDMI 1 to HDMI 2 because the stick ruined the first port due to overheating. I have it placed in a well-ventilated area but it doesn't seem to help the issue. I have ordered an HDMI extender to get the stick away from the TV port. Hopefully, that will solve the problem.Also, the ROKU stick does NOT have a web browser!  What? Not recommended.

  The ROKU device works great if the WiFi is currently active, but if the previous connected wifi is not active, this devices is horrible.I use two different Hotspots that I use to connect to the Roku.  If the last connected device is not on, Roku is not smart enough to scan for the 2nd wifi connection.  When it is searching for the 1st wireless connection it locks up the entire system for 2-3 minutes while it tries to connect.  You can't use the back button, search for new wifi, etc until it finally gives up.  It is a major pain when I have to switch between Wifi/Hotspot connections.  Every other digital device I have ever owned knows to scan previous used wifi connections if the first one is not available.  Major disappointment.

  Been using Roku for years. the nice thing about it is all the apps that you can use on it. Also if you have Xfinity/Comcast you can get rid of one of your small digital boxes that you use in like bedrooms that I think at like $7 month. You can get the Comcast/Xfinity stream on this and watch all your channels. So basically this will pay for itself of in like 3 to 5 months depending on what Roku Device you get.

  I would have given this 5 stars, but the Streaming Stick + does not live up to the claim of extended wifi range. Mine is about 30 feet away from the router. It sometimes plays video quality worse than the crappiest VHS. When it works well, which is most of the time, it buffers at the most inopportune moments. Within 20 feet it probably works great.12/09/2019 - I am amending this review. I got sick of constant buffering and crappy picture. Tonight, it would not connect to the internet at all. I tried rebooting everything, 0 Mbs. My laptop, across the room was connected at 20Mbs. I switched the Streaming Stick + with the Roku Express in my bedroom and the connection speed matched the computer! I put the Streaming stick + in the bedroom, 15 feet closer to the router, and got a whopping 6 Mbs. What a piece of crap! The Express version works 3x better at half the price, twice as far away from the router! Do not buy this over-priced piece of garbage!

  Arrived on time in solid packaging. Very, very pleased with my purchase. I cut the cord years ago but I've been steadily looking for a platform that met all my needs and wants, that didn't cost an arm and a leg, and didn't take a NASA engineer to hook up. I got EVERYTHING and MORE! I was THRILLED to only make a one-time purchase and have no monthly fee. This mini-computer hooks up to the back of your tv in a snap, and if you can use a cell phone, you can program it. Very clean, simple user interface; thorough, but concise, directions. Once I got it hooked up, I was astounded by all the choices. I don't watch much regular TV at all, but I can get a reel of my local and regional newscasts, the big three US networks stream 24/7, and the choices of tv show/movie programming is mind-boggling. You can use Prime or any of the other major streaming channels, they have TONS of free programming, and you can order any movie ever produced, basically. You can get music channels, watch YouTube, and I'm sure I'll discover more. I upgraded and got the voice remote. This has everything Xfinity has and way more than Spectrum, with no stupid $85/mth for basic cable. Oh, if you're a FoxNews fan or any channel that only comes with a cable subscription, you do have to sign in with that. But I don't watch any 24/7 news so that wasn't an issue for me. If you're looking to cut the cord and still get value out of your programming choices, buy this. I consider this one of the most valuable, cost-effective purchases I've made in recent memory. 100% satisfied. They could design volume modulation between apps but I can live with it.

  Extremely disappointed in this Roku. I purchased this because my other Roku would lose connection to the internet often. This one is not much better. It took forever to set up because I couldn’t connect. Finally I have it working, and after just a few days I had to change the batteries. Only a week later the remote was dead again. And, I only used the Roku a handful of times. Replaced batteries a third time, again they only lasted one week. And, I am using good Equalizer batteries! After reading the reviews, I see this is a consistent problem with this Roku.

  Tired of paying the increasing cable bill - for the 300+ stations of which were mostly duplicates or foreign-language versions of the others (not to mention all the shopping channels that are useless to me) - I cut the cable, opted to test ROKU because of what I saw some friends had while using it, and I do NOT regret it at all (cable even has ads on some ROKU channels). It opens up a entirely new viewing arena - one that truly allows you to cater your viewing to your time, needs and desires (plus, with Amazon Prime! - wow! tons of movies). I get the local news - if and when I want - the national and global news, and am saving tons of money! I think the quality of the pix for the most part are better than cable.

  This streaming stick consistently overheats and crashes after a few hours of use. The manufacturer provided an extension cable that was supposed to fix the problem but it doesn't. Now It loses the voice stream after a few hours of use and eventually crashes and loses its information regarding streaming services. It also pulls more power from the usb port than the Sony Bravia is willing to provide.I have used roku devices for many years and this is the worst product I have had from Roku.I would not buy again and I would not reccommend it to anybody.

  We just got rid of our cable tv package, which was not my idea. I loved my dvr box. My husband has used a Roku stick for the past year. We do not have smart tv’s. Upon set up my husband swapped my new Roku stick for his older one because this newer Roku model is able to control the tv’s power and the volume control, eliminating the need for two remotes.  There is definitely a learning curve to using a Roku stick and setting it up, at least there is for for us middle-aged parents. I’m not sure my elderly parents could figure this out. The only disappointment so far has been the Duracell batteries that came with the Roku stick were almost dead and it took me a while to figure that out as I thought the remote wasn’t working but it turns out the batteries were just dead.  My husband prefers the Roku to the Firestick. We own both. This Roku comes with the charging block, remote, smart stick and an extension cable.  It has no trouble streaming with our spectrum WiFi.

  Lots of problems with function. I was really looking forward to Roku being better than our Fire TV sticks. A cousin talked Roku up so I bought one. I am not happy with it.First off, the remote fails to connect to the Roku stick EVERY TIME I USE IT. I have to carry the remote to the TV, take off the remote cover and push the pairing button several times to get it to work. I have paired the remote several times it does not help.Also, the Roku often gets the time alignment messed up -- sound and video do not match. The sound it a couple of seconds behind the video. To fix this I have to turn off the TV unhook the Roku. Reinstall the Roku and restart the TV. It's not a big deal, except that I have to do this a few times a week. This NEVER happens, or has happened with firetv sticks.I have contacted Roku support three times with no real help. They're very confusing on customer service and tech support. All done in emails. They have not been of any help thus far.I'm pretty disappointed in the Roku streaming stick plus. Wish I'd never bought it and had just reset my old firesticks before I bought it. After resetting the firetv sticks and reinstalling apps, these years old streaming sticks run circles around the Roku for less money.

  Wow. Loved the Roku at 1st. It worked great. Fast forward a few months... my son and I watched several videos- maybe an hour ot two. The unit cut off. We were perplexed. He went to reset it and it was hot, when I say hot, I mean REALLY HOT. We decided to let it be for the night. A few days later, we wanted to watch a movie so we tried to fire it up... NOPE, would not connect.  We tried all hdmi ports, we googled blinking lights and how to reset and error messages, etc. NOTHING worked.  We gave up. Now, about a month later, I decide to try again, even bought new cord and checked the TV for issues - still cannot connect to the thing. Very disappointed with this purchase. Thought we were going to do better with the Roku vs the firestick, but seems they both have flaws. So sad that I can't watch my show 😢

  Late last year I broke my 1080p tv. Luckily was able to get a brand new 4k tv a few months later. At first I thought since it was a 4k smart tv I could watch 4k movies. Man was I wrong. Learned only select devices can no matter the tv. So I knew it was time for a new Roku player (had a gen 1 so didn't look good even on 4k). After shopping around and asking questions I went with the Roku streaming stick+. I love it. It even makes non 4k movies and shows look amazing. For the price its so worth it. I was nervous at first because I read my 4k tv needed hdcp 2.2 hdmi outlets or else at best would be 1080p and I couldn't find anything in the manual and behind the tv to say it did. But found out through research my tv did.What is also nice is the fact its not a box, its a stick that goes into a hdmi port (rather then hdmi cable connecting the two) so less clutter on the shelf. Also you don't need to aim the remote directly at it to use it. You can be in front of a wall and it would work. So no need to worry about where you stick it in the tv (for me the hdmis were behind the tv and not on the side).  It is your typical Roku player, has the same apps as the first gen plus any 4k apps (there is a section for it). Also some of the apps (Netflix, hulu) looks completely different then their older model counterparts so had to get used to it.The remote is your standard Roku. Same set up with some very nice features. If you sync it to your tv you can turn off the tv without tv remote and even control the volume (volume controls are on the side) so makes it easier versus using two remotes. A very nice feature is audio control. Kind of like siri or alexxa.. You push the button and make a command to open an app or search for a movie, show or app.Overall the pros are great and cons are nothing to worry about. Id do some research before buying to make sure your tv has the right hdmi ports or else you spent more money on the same thing as a cheap model for non 4k tvs. Defiantly recommend.Pros:-amazing picture for both 4k and hd-No box-don't need to aim remote at device-price-remote features-voice controlCons:-needs a specific hdmi for it to work-some apps are different then the ones on other Roku models

  I've owned multiple Roku devices over the years.  I took a chance on the stick and regret the purchase.  This seems to be powered by a combination of wall plug and USB port.  It starts very slow.  After watching for twenty minutes, it delivers a low power warning and will no longer work.  USB etc is providing power, the device status light is properly illuminated.  I suggest you skip this particular product and buy one of the higher quality Roku devices.  Alos, this device is not portable.  If you travel with it and plug it in, you get stopped with a notice that the device can only be used in your home where you first registered it.  Not consumer friendly.

  Weve had Rokus for years.  This one is great as well, minus 1 major problem.  It drains batteries within 2 weeks or so with very little use.  You'd be spending plenty in batteries over 1 years time.  Roku failed. The remote must be ""looking"" for the roku when the TV is off, I cant think of any other reason why the batteries would drain. I have a replacement coming, so we will see if the issue is persistent.Update: Got the  new roku stick from Amazon, thanks to their great return policy. Unfortunately it was not a defective issue. Again same problem. The remote kills batteries within a week with little use.  Solution? I thought I would move on without the remote and just download the roku app to use my phone as the remote.  STILL A FAIL!  The app will not ""see"" the Roku stick, and it wont even connect manually using the IP address.  What a joke.  Come on Roku, the user interface is the most important part of the device.  If I dont have a remote control, how can i use it?

  I purchased for an older Polaroid flat tv used in a bedroom and had issues from day one.  I always assumed the issues stemmed from the older tv, not the Roku. At first I was able to unplug the tv, let stand ten minutes, and it would start up just fine with access to Roku apps.  I would need to do this unplug routine each time, finally that work around stopped working all together.  I changed the Roku batteries a number of times.  During this time, the tv itself was clearly getting power. Finally, after a little over two months of minimal use, I placed the tv in the garage for garbage and gave the Roku to my son.  This Roku is an upgrade for the one that he has because he's able to control the volume and such. After hooking the ""new"" Roku up, it did not work for him either. His tv is not even a year old and never had any issues with the older Roku. We quickly determined it wasn't my older tv that was the issues but the Roku itself. Unfortunately at this time, I no longer have the packaging and for all I know, it's past it's return period anyways.  Going forward, I will purchase in person at a box store.

  This was my third Roku device purchased.  Up until now I was extremely happy and would highly recommend Roku to all of my friends and family.  I was having difficulty with the Roku that was in my bedroom mainly because my room is located at the furthest location from my wi-fi so I decided to try the streaming device with the long-range wireless.  I received the device and set it up just like the others, put in information, etc.  At this point I was given a code to enter online to activate my Roku, which I did and was given a phone number to call to assist.  I did this and here is where the problems begin.  For the first time ever from Roku, I was given the hard sell.  I had told them that I had Spectrum and the customer service rep began telling me about how I could pay them a one time $100 fee to get 500 channels or $150 to get 1000 channels.  I said ""no thank you, just activate my device.""  Pressure continues.  I finally said that I'm not giving out my credit card number and I have never had to with my 2 previous roku devices.  He finally activates it.  Still trying to sell me the other channels.  I say ""no thank you"" a final time then hang up.  A short time later my device has been deactivated and here is the worst part, ALL OF MY DEVICES HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN!!  I'd like to give them another chance but as of right now I am a very DISSATISFIED customer!

  I really don't like that. In order to get the device to work, you must sign up for an account with them and have a credit card on file.  For a company that advertises on and on about ""free"" that was a bit of a shock. It really should say that up front in the description.

  I'm posting this review mostly to document my experience with Roku support.  I have three of these in my home, and am pretty happy with how they work.  Recently, one of them ""bricked"", not sure if it was due to an update or just hardware failure (after about 7 months of use).  Went on Roku and did chat-based support.  It took about 30 minutes to walk through the hard reset, restart, etc. steps with the rep that I had already done.  When we got to the end of the process, the rep sent me an RMA number and address to mail my Roku stick to.  A week, later, I got a replacement.  Bottom line, the company stand behind its product.The product hasn't really changed, although I did notice that the remote now has a ""non-slip"" type finish as opposed to the slick glossy finish my previous remotes had (which is a little nicer).  Yet to be determined if the remote eats batteries as quickly as the old one.Other than the remote's battery consumption, my only complaint as a multiple device owner has to do with setup.  When activating the Roku, I have to go through the whole ""channel selection"" setup again, which is kind of annoying.  My devices are registered with Roku, and they should know what I use.  It's also painful to have to re-register each channel (Hulu, Netflix, etc.) but I'm guessing that is because of ""differences of opinion"" in how registration should work (i.e. does Hulu trust Roku to act as an authentication proxy).

  It works as well as all my previous Fire TV Sticks, but keeps dropping the audio. I have to reboot before using it every day, and sometimes more than once. I hope it goes away after the next update as it seems to have started after the new software version release came out this month. Fingers crossed. Great value for functionality though to get the most out of a Prime subscription.

  That's essentially my critique. I love the features and that I can play my music from Amazon on it. The bad side is, it freezes. The sound disappears and I have to unplug it and plug it back in like we do frozen computers. Seeing as the tv is on the wall with little wiggle room, it's a royal pain.I like that you can't see it (I'd been using an ancient Roku that no longer worked for anything but Pandora). I have to give it time to see if I'd buy it for my main TV.

  When my LG Smart TV became a non-SMART tv (known problem with LG TVs), I was contemplating on either getting it fixed or just buying another smart TV.  But then I saw the FireStick lite for $18, so I gave it a try.  It arrived the next day and I immediately hooked it up and downloaded apps...I got my ""smart"" TV back.  It works great on wifi.  Since my tv is located just on the other side of the wall where our router is, I don't need the adapter.  No buffering.  I like it so much that I bought another one for another TV.

  The Fire Stick Lite is the upgrade that I've been waiting for. I purchased the first generation Fire Stick when it came out and it worked wonderfully. But then it began to slow down response-wise so I knew it was time to step it up! But I can say the 1st Gen Fire Stick ran its course very well, and the Fire Stick Lite is that next level for streaming music, movies, and so much more. I couldn't be more happier with this upgrade. One of the best choices I've ever made.

  I love the Firestick and all of the smart features it added to a dumb TV. However, the only drawback is the Firestick disrupts my cable service everytime my wife watches it. So, that means every time she wants to switch back to cable, I have to reboot the system. I've recently been doing a fix I have found online, ""Fire Stick causes interference with my TV when viewing with an HD antennae. Only fix is to unplug Fire Stick from wall outlet."" In the end, I'm hoping for a permanent fix so that I can enjoy the Firestick without getting off the couch.

  I installed this on the back of a Samsung television (HDMI port). I used a spare USB port connection on my Netgear mesh network satellite instead of plugging it in with the 120VAC USB power adaptor that it comes with. I was getting an error message saying not supported device and insufficient/low power but it runs just fine despite the error message. This is just a little tip in case you are strapped for 120VAC sources behind your television like I was. I didnt have any room to add the 120VAC USB power adaptor. The software update took a little longer than I would have liked to have waited but oh well.  I am happy with the remote despite it not being able to control my televisions volume, I figured it was worth saving the $10.

  This worked surprisingly easy on our 42 inch Samsung.  Connection was a piece of cake, and to get it set up was done automatically.  Only thing to remember is to have your passwords handy to connect to your paid services such as  Netflix and also your wifi connection.  Flipping from the Firestick services back to our Direct TV is really easy. The only downside, which isn't a problem for us is that you have one more remote to deal with!  Buying one for my 84 yr old father now that I know how easy it is to use!

  Just got it today and the installation was a bear...after freezing multiple times, unplugging and plugging in again and again, using advice from the internet about resetting, etc, it finally installed.From the looks of it it may bite the dust soon, like another stick I had. They keep shipping shoddy products, be it the hardware or the software. The irony is: the programs, like children's stuff via Prime are terrific, so other offerings.... go figure...

  Our cable bill got very high and on top of that our carrier charged a late fee because the post office did not our payment to them on time, one day late, post mark show it was mailed in time. We made the purchase of a second fire tv control and found so many free channels to watch. The picture and sound are great and it only took a few minutes to set up. This is the best way for us to watch tv and not have to scan channels all day to find something to watch.

  I had a Firestick with TV control already, however, my particular TV brand was not supported. I wanted another Firestick anyway, and used my original Firestick for a TV that was supported, and purchased this one for the TV that wasn't. It works exactly the same as the original one, you just can't control your TV with it. In my case, it was no loss. The set up was easy, quick, and using it is simple and self explanatory. For an older or off brand TV, this is a great alternative at a lower price.

  I was really happy with my Roku stick + at first. I'm still happy with the Roku but the remote is quitting on me bit by bit. It worked fine at first but then the Back button (the one by the OK button) stopped working. Now this week the Up button stopped working. I'm wondering if the Next button and the Down one will stop next.I've looked all over their site and the Roku tips and troubleshooting channel and can't find anything that addresses this problems. I changed the batteries. I reseated the batteries multiple times.I tried re-pairing the remote to the TV. I have tried every remedy I could find and not only do none of them work but it's slowly getting worse.I would have rated this quite highly if not for the remote issue. I've ordered one of their HDMI extender cables but somehow I don't have a lot of faith in it working either. I've only had this since July which seems really soon for the remote to stop working right. I wonder if they just expect me to order a new remote every 6 months or so.PS  I wrote this but got distracted and never submitted it. The remote suddenly started working the same day the extender arrived. Since it was here, I went ahead and connected the extender anyway, even though the remote was now working again. All went well for a while but today the remote went on semi-strike again.Not only can I not use the up or back buttons near the OK button again but now when I try to operate the remote, it randomly goes to a window asking if I want to add ESPN. (For the record, I definitely do NOT.) I tried rebooting and now it wants me to sign into my internet account, something I can't do because the remote won't move the cursor up or back.For the record, I have a Roku Ultra in the living room and it works great. For that matter, when the remote feels like working, the Stick is great too. The thing is, however, that if you can't count on it to work, the Stick is useless. I'd return the thing if I weren't past the return date. If you want a Roku, pay extra and get the Ultra. Don't waste your money and sanity on this version. Seriously, run away fast and hard from it.

  I got fed up with The constant “low storage” notifications from my Fire TVs and decided to try a Roku. After setting it up I immediately bought 2 more and ditched all my Fire TVs. Overall experience is a bit cleaner since you’re not constantly beaten over the head with Prime Video recommendations and banner ads. The app sign in experience seems better overall and the companion app is a huge step up over FTV. The private listening feature is an unexpected winner for me, it allows you to shift the audio from the Roku to your phone which is great for late night viewing.

  I ordered my first Roku in 2012.  It was an LT.  it has been great!  When we upgraded to a 4K tv, I wanted to get a 4K streaming device, so I ordered this.  The picture is really awesome and we have not had buffering issues, like we had started having with our LT.  It was nice at first to not have to point the remote at an IR device.  Despite all the channels and niceties of the device, two things were annoying.  Only one of this things so bad that it absolutely won’t work for us.  First, the addition of amazon ads was a surprise and a TRULY annoying one, as now we need to have our children cover eyes and mute the tv during ads.  Typically they are ok, but we have a particularly visually sensitive child and he can’t handle some of them.The thing that made us have to return this twice and downgrade to the Roku Express is the fact that the remote will NOT stay paired.  It goes great for initial setup but loses the remote soon thereafter.  It says there is a paired remote, but it does not work.  This happened the first time and we thought it was a fluke so we returned it.  The second one did the same.  At this point I don’t want anything that pairs with a remote via WiFi.  So, I looked at the ones that I am assuming are infrared and it just seemed silly to pay for the premiere so we are going to try the express.  It doesn’t have 4K so I am very frustrated, but there is no way I am buying the Ultra.  If the express doesn’t work I am not sure what I will do.  I have read similar negative reviews where the remote would not stay paired so I am not the only one with this issue.  Such a disappointment!

  I bought this streaming device for our basement that we use for friends at at times as a rental. I've never owned a roku and was at first hesitant because due to being so used to iOS streaming device.Since I didn't want to spend so much money, I decided to go with the streaming stick. It honestly took me about 10 minutes out the box to set up (would have been less but have to test volume, screen, etc). All I had to do was plug in to HDMI cable, attach power cord to stick and then that cord to usb behind tv an viola! (note: if for some reason the stick doesn't fit or is to tight, you can get a free HDMI extender from ROKU).Pros:Easy set-upUser friendly interfaceRemote has Netflix/Disney +/Hulu and Sling buttonsHas a un-biased platform (basically, all apps are available on Roku, including xfinity stream-can't get this on iOS).Has a free (ad-supported) channel called the Roku channel. This is good for cord cutters.Cons:Bulky Remote

  I love the Roku product. They have always been easy to set up, easy to use and they stream great. I've got smart TV's and they tend to be wonky at times. Some of the apps on my TV won't load, or they have to be restarted. Roku fires right up and is a great product. I ordered this one for an older smart TV it was easy to connect to the WiFi, and aside from having to log into all of my apps (which you have to do for any new device like this) it was great. Roku has a mobile app as well, so i can use my phone as a remote, and i can plug my headphones into the app to listen as well. Works great at night when others are sleeping, or when you have a fan or other background noise. I just ordered the Roku sound bar for our living room!

  This does not complete the setup procedure.Calls to their support was fruitless. They suggested that the stick was defective and I should send it back to Amazon. Not only did the replacement have the same problem, buying a third one behaved the same problem. It updates for new software and loops back to the beginning. Checking the users group, many other people who like me had the misfortune of also purchasing this product. Now with Covid 19, you cannot have a live conversation with tech support, not even by chat, you have to email them and they get back to you in 24 hours. Having email them of all I did, rebooting my router maybe 1 times, even though all my other wireless products were working fine, that was their suggestion, I knew they were wrong. There last suggestion was to try it on another tv. I have up. As an electronic technician, I question what that have to do with this issue. Should I throw my TV in the garbage. My feelings are that there is a software problem. If they are correct, which I doubt, the product should be sold with a list of television’s that are not comparable with this unit. So in short I put back my older Roku and it works fine, although it is not a 4K.Beware

  I've had Roku's for years, the erector set solution for streaming. Complaints in the past have been more along the line of having to unplug the device every week or so, otherwise it would just turn unresponsive (you think they'd put a reset switch on it). Bought a new one hoping for improved performance.....and now I must pair my remote with the stick at random times. Simply said, poor quality remote. Amazon was nice enough to show me how to do the pairing (I'm lucky enough to have had a remote with the pair button on it), but frankly pairing the remote multiple times a day is pretty lame.So......I bought a replacement remote, looks like the one that came with the unit, but alas it doesn't have the pairing button, and when paired with no instructions and a little time on the internet yielding nothing.....I'm done with Roku.If you like spending your time getting cheap commodity equipment to work, this unit is for you. I'm going to try the Firestick and see if it is any better.

  Update 12-22-19: Have to knock this down to 3 stars from 5. Not sure what the issue is here but 30-40% of the time we switch from watching TV over to the HDMI for the Roku the thing is hung up. Sometimes it snaps out of it after 30-60 seconds but today for the first time I had to restart the TV. SUPER annoying.We finally replaced our 5-year-old box unit because we were tired of seeing the mess of cords around the TV. This stick works fantastic. Just a couple of things to note.1. Same old user interface that has always been there--totally fine with us because it makes sense and works.2. Plugs into HDMI port in TV but also REQUIRES power via the 4"" USB dongle. So your USB port needs to be right next to  the HDMI port or the dongle won't work. We have an OLD TV where there was an HMDI port on the side but no USB so that was out. I am sure you can get an extension for that but we never looked into it. It also comes with a wall power adapter but that defeats the point in some ways, we were trying to get rid of wires. Also some HDMI ports are close together and it may be difficult to get the wide ROKU stick plugged in while other components are plugged in. The manual states that if this is a problem you can contact Roku for a free HDMI extender dongle.3. The downside to plugging ROKU dongle into your TV's USB power is that the ROKU has to start up each time you power up your TV. Not a deal breaker for us but it takes a minute or so to power it up so just something to think about.4. The remote is perfect. It's not complicated and it just works. Some how we can adjust our TV volume with it and did not have to set anything up, that's a nice touch. It also has a Netflix button, Disney+, Sling, and Hulu button.5. If you lose your remote or want an extra one it is easy to download the Roku app to your phone and control things that way.6. Some of the channels or apps available on the Roku include: Fox Sports, CBS, NBC and NBC Sports, Bravo, HBGO, YouTube, PBS (our fav), Hulu, Disney+, Sling, Vudu, Netflix, ESPN, Pandora etc etc.Overall, awesome product for the $50 or so it costs.

  I appear to be one of MANY who are experiencing the battery drainage issue. We bought two of these for Christmas and installed them on the same day. In 5 weeks, one of the remotes has been through 3 sets of batteries and the other has been through 2. Ironically, the TV we use daily has been through the lesser of the two. Roku does not have a solution and simply says, ""we're aware and are working on it."" We're at the point where we're going to need to buy rechargeable batteries, because we can't keep going through batteries like this. Please, please fix this, Roku!

  My television stopped working all of a sudden so to save money since I didn't know if it was the Roku or tv I bought an updated Roku.  Luckily it was the Roku.  Everything is pretty much the same as the old one although setting up the television to 1080p the picture is far superior than the tv with the old Roku.  I can't say what the old setting was but I'm happy with the outcome.I also think the wireless connection is better with the newer Roku because the television doesn't seem to be as slow.All in all I'm very happy with the new purchase.

  First to install the Fire Stick hook up was fine but to get it to connect was really  hard and if it wasn't for the neat Amazon Fire Stick customer service in South Africa I would be such a muddle - she really knew which of the buttons to press for so long and what 3 to press at the same time , I swear I never could have figured it out. That information is NOT on that little connection folder. She should be awarded a medal . I did great hooking it up but after that it was good grief what do I do NOW.!  She kept guiding me through the steps and my TV is working like a charm. She showed me the benefits of also Amazon and all the other programs but with my budget, I need Jeff Bezos to send a few  hundred thousand and No problem.  My husband had passed away last year and was so ill with Parkinson so it is  budget world 101.  Love Netflex ! Love Amazon!  Dena

  Amazing positive difference from the original Fire Stick......so much more responsive, with uninterrupted streaming.  I'd become frustrated with the old stick. I thought the 21.99 price was worth the gamble that I could get back the performance I had enjoyed with the original.  I'm very happy with the Fire Stick Lite, enough so that I have ordered the next step up with the TV volume control.  Good product.  My only reservation is the TV setting icon is inconvenient and I keep hitting it instead of the pause/play.

  I TRY TO BE DETAILED AND INCLUDE PICTURES WHEN I CAN SO HERE GOES. ITS A GOOD PRODUCT. ALL YOU NEED IS INTERNET. THE SETUP WAS PRETTY BASIC JUST LIKE MY OTHER FIRESTICKS. AN ADDED FEATURE IS THAT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE LITTLE TV TUBE ICON, IT OPENS PLUTO TV RATHER THAN YOU LOOK FOR IT MANUALLY. THE DOWNSIDE IS THERE NO VOLUME CONTROL WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR REGULAR T. V REMOTE TO ADJUST THE VOLUME. I WOULD BUY AGAIN ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PRICE. ITS A STEAL.

  From the second day on the sound would not come on unless you manually reset when turning the tv on. At first it was only the first time of the day, now its every single time you turn on the tv. Even if it was on the same input or not.I was using the extender and i read somewhere that may be the cause, but then either fix the extender that you ship inside the orange box with this or dont include it. Well see if that was the problem but im still returning for something different.

  An impulse buy but a good one.Easy to setup. Like freakishly easy. I would have preferred a USB C connector to micro but oh well. Reasonably small. Settings are not intuitive but you can learn it fast enough. Interface could use some simplifying but that's where the Alexa comes into play.I mostly use it with my monitor that's got crappy speakers but that's where the Bluetooth pays off.Overall it adds more life to any device that's got a good HDMI port.

  I bought this in hopes of using it instead of our xbox, and there were some apps that were not available on the xbox but were on the fire stick.  I am definitely unhappy that we have yet to be able to watch anything on the disney plus app.  I have had to restart it a few times in only a couple of weeks because it would not open up my profile and then my husband's profile, then mine again.  We also had to restart it because it froze up a couple of times while watching a show.... the voices would continue to play, but the screen froze up.  There definitely needs to be some updates or something to fix these issues.  One positive is that it was easy to set up.

  I’m not the right person to review this item but I got it because I wanted an upgrade from my first generation Fire Stick. There were no guarantees that it would work with my older model Visio television and it didn’t. When I got it home and qset it up one show streamed perfectly and after that the only thing I could get was an onscreen error message which said “not support.” No matter what I tried, including powering down, turning off the router, etc. would bring it back. I returned it but assume that most everyone else will have a very good experience with the product.

  The Fire Stick Lite is the same as the Fire Stick other than the missing TV controls, so if you don't mind using 2 remotes then you can save about 10$ for it.It has 1080p support which is good enough for most content and the connection is pretty stable.It directly goes into the HDMI port of the TV and needs a power supply. Then you can use all the supported streaming apps which are optimised for Fire TV.Overall a very good deal if you're looking for a cheap streaming device for your TV. The Alexa integrations and support makes it better as it can essentially make your TV a smart TV/display.

  I bought this Fire Stick primarily because it had the HBO Max App that my Rokus did not have.  Ironically, Roku added the HBO Max App soon after this arrived, but I am still impressed with the Fire Stick.  It has very clear (1080P) picture and sound, no buffering (works well with my wifi router), and a nice selection of Apps.  The voice search is also a plus, especially in a product this inexpensive.  If you're looking for Apps such as Spectrum or Xfinity, this product doesn't download them, but it does have the Premium channel Apps associated with mainstream cable companies.

  I bought the Fire Stick because my older Samsung TV would not connect to BritBox. I received a gift subscription to BritBox and wished to use it. I was told that I had to purchase one of several devices to interface between the internet and my TV. Fire Stick was recommended. When I set up my Fire Stick I could not activate it without first agreeing to a trial subscription to Amazon Prime (I already had an Amazon account) and also agreeing to a trial subscription to BritBox (to which I already had the one year gift subscription). I have since cancelled both of these forced agreements. I'm not sure what will happen next.

  I load a channel, and it's like the tv is giving me the long, clueless ""blink"". The menu will come up...but you just get to look at it. This happens multiple times a day. Or the channel will keep playing after I have excited the channel (app) I have to turn off the tv, wait for a little while and turn it back on. Yes, I've re-set it. A couple of times. I've watched the tutorial videos, keeps happening.  I shouldn't have to reset it at all. I regret buying the fire stick instead of the other well-known streaming device.

  This has worked out just great.  We have Xfinity Flex but didn't want to pay a monthly fee for a second flex box.  The Xfinity rep expressly told me a Fire stick would not work with the system, but it works fine.  Xfinity flex does not support AppleTV or Disney Plus so this works out great for our family.  I just wish the buttons were lit so when we are watching a movie in the dark and need to pause or rewind, I could see the buttons and stop accidentally hitting the home button.

  All I can say is that ""THE FIRE STICK IS AWESOME"" I don't know why it took me so long to discover it.  Even though I've had it for a couple of weeks now I'm still in the process of learning more unique things about what it gives me access too like things I was not even aware existed.  The set up was easy just put the connecting pieces together and plug it into the HDMI port and get started.  My advice don't wait too long like I did and get your fire stick now!!!!  It's well worth it!

  Bought a fire stick so I can watch all the streaming services I have. Still can’t have them all in one place. They all work great, EXCEPT PRIME VIDEO. I’ve restarted the fire stick and filled out my logins and passwords so many times. I’m over it. That’s obnoxious doing that. Still can’t get it to work. The one time while trying it signed me up for a new prime account and charged me and to get that fixed and my money back took 4 different customer service reps and wasted over an hour of my time. Every person kept telling me they didn’t see the charge and they wanted me to dispute it with my bank. I’m over it. I just want to watch all my streaming services in one place. Was ready to put a firestick on all my TVs, but whats the point? Very frustrating and I’m over it. I’m sure the problem will eventually find a solution some how, but I’m sure I’ll have to do my logins and passwords for the billionth time.

  The new presentation is very nice. Thing appear to move faster.However the move from the prior Fire TV was not as easy and seamless as it should have been. I neded to reload several apps and sign in again with ID and password... time consuming and unpleasant experience. Tune-in was not moved over and the new Tune-in app is bare bones and essentially useless.  So i brought back mu old Logitech internet radio to listen to my stations. too bad.AMAZON, you can do better !

The 4K version does not have this issue.

  I love this fire stick.  Because the price was right, and what it comes with is unreal.  It has a remote control, Alexa she can talk back.  And it is so easy to set up. It takes you anywhere you want to go.  If Alexa can’t take you there she will tell you. And you can put it on six TVs love it.  I would buy this product again , but I don’t have too. Because I just told you it can go on six TVs anywhere you  cannot beat this.  Just get it you won’t be sorry.  It’s a keeper.

  I LOVE the amazon photos. Along with streaming my Disney, Netflix, You Tube. Photos are a great way to view family photos on the TV. I have setup for a screensaver to come on when I am not using the FireStick. I have uploaded almost 9000 pictures and we thoroughly enjoy the application.When friends and family come over we just sit back and discuss the memories. The Amazon Music that I enjoy on my phone is now playing in my home. Just press the Microphone button and say"" Play my Soundtrack"" , ""Play Van Halen"" and it does what I ask.We love it!

  I like being able to watch Netflix and other programming options (which I didn't realize I would have) by using this Fire Stick Lite.  The little remote control works OK, and allows for typing in the name of a program.  However, Alexa (which I did not realize I would have since I do not own a separate Alexa device) is a little fussy.  Sometimes the 'show' will begin but the voice activation issues such as no volume (in one instance) and / or no picture (in another) will occur.  So, I go back and manually plug in what I want to watch, where is works as intended.  I have yet to figure out how to use the volume control separately from my cable box remote.

  I received on Thursday. Hooked it up. Everything worked well. Friday, everything worked. Saturday, everything worked. Sunday, no picture or menus. I know the trick of unplugging the power, waiting a few seconds, plugging it back in and letting in reboot. Tried that. Nada. Switched electrical jacks. Switched HDMI ports. TV still works. Roku still works. Nothing from Firestick. Dark screen. No menu. No Alexa. Took it upstairs to see if it would respond to a change of scenery. No dice that way either. It was on a surge protector. Just apparently a bad device. If you're reading, Amazon, how do you make good?

  Update on 7/25/2020:2 Remotes have quit working within 8 months of my purchase. I have replaced batteries, tried to resync and nothing solves the issue. We now have to use my cell phone and Roku app in 2 different rooms of our home just to use the streaming sticks which are our only source of TV news and movies.  I purchased 2 replacement devices about one month thinking I was giving us backup devices and now I am past their return window and I know those remotes are going to crap out on me too...NOT HAPPY with dropping a total of $250+ when the remotes last less than 1 year.Update on 01/07/2020:We now have three if these because our Daughter’s “smart” TV that is just over a year old suddenly decided to have issues with all of the built in apps.  This stick is perfect for those who have this happen, or have a TV without built in apps, or those like me who used their game system for streaming until too much use fried an expensive console and caused the loss of hundreds and hundreds of hours of save game data! I recommend these to everyone because they are perfect for our streaming only household.Orig Review:Okay...I absolutely fried my PS4 because as much as I would use it to game on I would also use it to fire up my Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, etc.  I never checked into these types of devices before because I guess I just thought my PS4 would be eternal (LOL).  As all things tech related eventually do, my PS4 completely crashed and hundreds of hours on my games were lost to me, but in that awful sad moment I decided to replace my PS4 AND go ahead and buy 2 of these to use here at home so that our XBox One wouldn't suffer the same fate in our living room.  I know...I'm terrible, huh?Anyways - ROKU.  LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!  So easy to setup, easy to add apps to your menu, easy to navigate, quick to load the apps and most important of all I no longer have to worry about using my gaming consoles as entertainment beyond the games they are meant to play!  Win Win!!!!I am seriously amazed at how quick the apps launch/load - it's darn near immediate and the interface is clean and easy to use.  I love that I can add apps/manage everything from anywhere even when I'm not at home - adding and removing channels is a breeze.  It even recognized our TVs without any issues and even some of the universal TV remotes we've bought cannot do that as efficiently as the ROKU did.  We are definitely going to be long-time ROKU fans and will buy new ones when needed because they are well worth the price.  My husband loves the one in the living room and he has never watched as much TV as he has since I installed the ROKU out there.  If we had more TVs we would have more ROKU's.

  This unit replaced an original Fire TV Stick from several years ago that had become painfully slow! What a difference! It is fast, clear, easy to use and works great! I really didn't need the voice remote feature and there is a Alexa Dot within a foot of the TV so I didn't need that feature either. But - I wanted a faster experience on our non-smart, kitchen TV where the old Fire Stick lived - this does the trick perfectly for not a lot of money!

  This is the 5th Fire Stick I have bought.  it was to replace the oldest one which was getting flaky.  The original remote suffered from being too symmetrical But this new one is truly stupid layout.  Doesn't Amazon have any ergonomics experts on staff???  You should at least do some testing of changes before applying them.  Luckily, one can pry off the ""Guide"" rubber button to get it out of the way.  Someone could make a lot with a ""filler"" plug.

  We have four tv's in the house, and this will be the second Firestick for us.  The voice remote is nice, as it's faster to search for a title than inputting the alphabet.  I like the way profiles can be created for different users.  I don't use the Alexa feature because Alexa, Siri, and Cortana are not welcome here.  Since we cut the cord to cable the Firesticks are what we use to stream all our shows.  We also have two Roku's and like them just as well.

  I have been watching more TV since I got this.  I enjoy the weird type of programs and this provides.  Being technologically challenged, I have not set up Alexa or any type of voice commands.  I enjoy the programming, so have no major complaints.  The only complaint is that every day I have to let it reboot before the audio comes on.  The video is no problem.  There’s just no audio until I reboot it.  My husband showed me what to do, so it’s no big deal for me ant more. Otherwise, I enjoy the programming on the fire stick.

  Even though this version did not come with the compatible option to change the volume of the TV, I love being able to see movies and shows that are free on Prime but are quite expensive and only available for rental on my cable tv. For now I will keep both because there are some shows that aren't available on Firestick but are available to me on cable. But I am truly loving the extra movies that I get to watch from my phone instead of trying to watch them from the miniture screen on my mobile devices.

  We love Amazon fire sticks so much that we have purchases three as well as one for my parents house. So easy to download several streaming apps to be able to watch anything you want. I’ve also downloaded the fire stick app for those times I can find the remote and I’m too tired to get out of bed to find it. Fire Remote app has been a life saver the time our kid hid two of them in her toy box until we found them weeks later. We’ve tried the competitors “remote” service and found Fire stick was much easier to navigate, download, search...ect, highly recommend!

  My only complaint for this item is the lack of an on/off button. I bought this as gift for my parents so it was a bit frustrating. Upon setting it up we realized they would need to use the TV remote to turn on and off before using the firestick. Maybe this was mentioned somewhere in the details and I somehow overlooked it?Regardless, the firestick works great but I was hoping to help them eliminate the need for more than one remote.I'm giving 2 stars because I wouldn't buy another of this style just for that reason.

  I installed the fire stick on an old 32 inch TV running 720p. Within 10 minutes I was surfing programs on Amazon Prime and YouTube. It is a simple device without bells and whistles which is what I wanted. The only hitch is with an Echo on my desk which ""hears"" commands for the TV and doesn't know what to do. I just need to be careful about where I'm pointing the stick. Great device, simple to set up, works as it is supposed to and lots of fun to play with.

  I wish Amazon made it easier to install third-party apps from APK files as well as apps from the Google Play store (so that we don't have to re-purchase all of our paid apps on the Amazon app store).  I also wish it were easier to remove the icons for Amazon music and such, but it WAS 15 bucks, so I can understand why Amazon would want us to buy more stuff.  Be warned: it's not just the video output that's limited to 1080p; if you try to play a 4K video, this stick will NOT downscale it, and will simply crash instead.  All that being said, one good thing about it is that I was able to plug it into my TV's USB port WITHOUT the special ""Made for Amazon"" power cable (sold separately) that costs $20 more.  If you have some promotional credit that only works on products sold by Amazon, this isn't a bad way to spend it, just remember that you get what you pay for.  If you're looking for the ultimate Android TV experience, go with an NVIDIA SHIELD instead!

  Bought this for my cheaper Westinghouse 50” 4K UHD LED because the tv only has pre-programmed apps. No app market.First setup only allowed 1080p. Switched hdmi port to the only one that has HDCP 2.2. It recognized 2.2, but only at 30 refresh when my tv is 60. Changed tv to hdmi 2.0 (it was on 1.4), then 60 refresh was recognized but wouldn’t recognize HDCP 2.2. Funny how it DID recognize 2.2 with tv settings on 1.4 hdmi at 30 refresh. I let it run at 4K 30 refresh with hdmi set to 1.4 hdmi. It acted fine for 2 days, then HDCP 2.2 error started up.Second install: change tv to hdmi 2.0 and ran 4K 60 refresh check. It recognized 60 refresh, but not hdmi 2.2. So, I ran factory reset and tried the same. Same issue. Then I tried “force output” and loaded Netflix. It ran a 2hr movie perfectly fine with great picture. I selected a show after, then BAM, HDCP 2.2 error all over again. I then changed settings to auto adjust screen type (resolution and refresh rate). Still got error. Then changed 4.2.0 to 4.2.2 and whole system locked up for several seconds. Started working fine again for 20 mins, then HDCP 2.2 error again.Ran through every error trouble-shooting guide Roku Tech Support gave me. Time after  time, HDCP 2.2 error.Today, I said F it. It’s hitching a ride with UPS later today. This particular model has a lot of people irritated for the same reason.

  Preface: This is our first streaming device and we are old school, this may help other dinosaurs... Our stick came complete, set up was easy and straightforward and it works great. We subscribe to several streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, CBS All Access, Sling, Disney+ etc. and the free ones, YouTube and Roku) but our bill is still only 1/2 of what it was with cable. We have good internet so there is no buffering problems. We have way more TV to watch now, in part because we like educational and documentary type material and don’t mind an old movie or original content. (We have so much it is easy to forget where you found something, but the home button is easy to find.)I watched the Roku set up video and read other reviews to prepare. For whatever reason, I have not experienced the problems that others have.

  Beware, this thing works fine now but I got charged 99 bucks to register.  It asked for registration pin and when the pin didnt work asked us for 100 dollar per 5 year subscription.  I was convinced that there was no other way to get the thing working so I did it.  He promised a bunch of special apps but looked like the same ones we had with our old roku.  I'm pretty sure I was scammed.

  After months of use, I have never managed to get this to stream an entire movie or TV show without intermittent flickering picture or outright HDCP errors and loss of picture. I've tried everything, and the problem persists and is only getting worse.My setup is as follows:Roku stick plugged into Marantz A/V 11.2 receiver, feeding through a Fiber Optic HDMI cable to an Optoma 4K Cinemax UST laser projector.I've swapped the HDMI cables, plugged the Roku stick directly into projector, changed settings in the receiver and Roku stick... You name it, I've tried it. To make sure it is in fact the Roku and not any of the other home theater components, I've switched the streaming stick out for a 4K Amazon Fire Stick from a different room, and have yet to have a single problem. We use Roku devices in 3 other rooms of the house, but I'm not impressed with this one. Unfortunately, It will be going in the trash.

  This would have been a good product. But there is a catch to it so BEWARE! When you buy it They don't tell you that in order to install the update you will have to pay $80.00 to $150.00 for the update. I told them to forget it I'd send it back and that's exactly what I have done

  Do not trust their support service, I called because Roku would not activate. They are from India and you can not even under stand them, thy said it was a problem with my network ,so he asked if I had a laptop he could gain accessto. he messed up my windows system by deleting files he said were  keeping the  Roku from connecting. I tried to get them to fix it but they clam it was not their fault . I ended up reinstalling windows . This is why I hate buying from Amazon so much.

  I recently purchased this product to compare with my Xbox one X. I wanted something that could work with the apps that I have and for family so they dont need to use my xbox.But my issues are this. The roku’s surround sound options doesnt compute completely with my set up. Yesterday I logged into my accounts, and I tried playing movies that I owned. Surround worked on what I purchased, yet there was audio lag and my subwoofer would make noises when someone spoke. On apps that I didnt personally buy, surround sound was non existent. And if it did, it was totally random and loud af. I kept messing around with the settings hoping I could find the right one but due to the rokus limitations. I just stopped looking because for some reason the movies I have were playing in Dolby Digital DTS and the regular apps only played in Stereo regardless of what setting I put in. Another issue is you also gotta understand that I have 4K HDMI splitter, so I couldnt have the option to just turn off the roku. It would turn off everything. And even so, when I would turn off the tv and sound system, the roku would still be playing. I took alot of my time trying to figure out the simplicity of this product only to just fall on my face with disappointment. And to remind you all, my Xbox set up took my sound system perfectly. I didnt have to change my subwoofer setting, the ONLY thing that roku has alil bit better is the screen quality in certain movies. But it doesnt mean a damn thing if the sound isnt fully there to accommodate that. I spent about 6+ hrs trying to research or work on the settings or cross checking between the roku and xbox.

  The ""Point-Anywhere"" Wi-Fi Remote is annoying and distracting from the watching experience. While RF (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) travels at the speed of light just like the IR (infrared),  with the ""point at the Roku"" remote there is nothing between the remote and the Roku. IT is in essence its own Network with immediate response. With the ""Point-Anywhere"" Wi-Fi  there is the whole network/system that needs to all work perfectly to get a reasonable response. With 3 - 7 Wi-Fi devices operating in the house at any one time the ""Point-Anywhere"" Wi-Fi Remote does not necessarily have the priority connection at any given time. Dumb idea. But then if you ""hide"" the Roku behind the TV as you have to with the Streaming Stick IR is not an option, although a dedicated Wireless link would be (Think Logitech Mouse). I have sent the Streaming Stick back for a refund.

  In order to setup and use this device you need to submit a credit card number. I tried every option I could to bypass this features as I don't intend to pay (ever) for streaming videos via Roku and yet I can't use their device unless I give them a credit card number.Sent it back waste of time and money.I have purchased several Firesticks and get access to all prime videos but was not asked to enter a credit card number in order to configure and use the Firestick, seems Roku would understand this but as long as people flippantly give out their personal data without resisting companies like Roku will get away with these kinds of practices.I strongly disagree with this basic business model and will not support companies that act like they can force a customer's hand.

  This is a heaping pile of garbage.  Do not buy!  The remote barely works sometimes... maybe 1 in every 20 clicks actually goes through to the Roku device, but it controls the TV and TV volume perfectly... go figure.  It also won't connect to your wireless network unless you log into your router via a web interface and change the security settings.  Once I did that, the Roku connected to the network... for about a week and now won't talk to the network.  This is the worst purchase I have ever made and is I credibly infuriating.To point, their website is loaded with troubleshooting videos related to the remote not working and network problems.  I went through them all to no avail.  Instead of building a quality product, they opted for the ""self help"" video route which essentially is an attempt to blame it on the customer. I have first gen Amazon sticks that still work like a charm and never had a problem setting up.

  I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick in 2016 and was happy with it. The Streaming Stick+ is an improved version with voice recognition that works well and the added TV controls to the remote is a handy new feature.The Stick+ is connected to a 2014 Sony 1080p TV. Set up was quick and easy. What's particularly nice about the Stick+ is that it stays hidden behind the TV so there's no additional clutter. Using the 5 GHz band, streaming quality is excellent with great picture and no issues with buffering. It's a great streaming device that offers a wide variety of both paid and free content.One nit is that while Roku claims the Stick+ has long-range wireless capability, I've found the wireless range is similar to the 2016 Streaming Stick with no discernible improvement. The Stick+ in my bedroom has no issues with either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands which is about 30 feet from the router. A Stick+ used in another bedroom about 12 feet farther away from the router has difficulty accessing the 5GHz band and really only works with the 2.4 GHz band.I've read other reviews which state the Stick+ tends to overheat. Even now during the heat of summer and after using the Stick+ for several hours at a time, I haven't that issue in 3 months of use. The only real problem I've had is that the device indicated that there was insufficient power. The Stick+ is powered through the TV's USB port. Simply unplugging the USB connector and plugging it back in solved that problem. It's happened only once and hasn't come up again. Overall, this device is trouble-free.This is my second Roku product and has cemented Roku as my my favorite streaming device. It's tough to go wrong with Roku.

  Ok. This is going to be long…but maybe something through my experience will help you solve something faster than me.I ended up with the Sony x800g 75” led 4k UHD HDR10 tv.Lots of numbers there. And often times you will hear stuff used interchangeably.• 4k isn’t all the same. So the term 4k related to the number of pixels on your screen.o 1080p was previous HD (high definition) and was 1920x1080 pixels.o 4k is generally 3840x2160• UHD is ultra high definition which also refers to the resolution of 3840x2160, however there are two versions of this.o One is 30hz. Normal movies and tv look “normal”o 60hz is great for action movies and fast movement such as sports• HDR/HDR10 also has two versions, but in simple terms, HDR is used to describe a certain grouping of picture settings to make your 4k look better. Higher contrast rates(darker black and whiter white). However there are 2 versions of this alsoo 30hz for traditional movies and tvo 60hz is great for those action movies and sports.What happened for me. It was time for a new tv. I already had a Yamaha surround sound receiver that all my consoles, and fire/roku sticks, and blueray players plugged into, and one single cable going to my tv. So the setup of a new tv was going to be fairly painless. Find the tv, buy the tv, remove the old tv and replace it with the new one. I got home, got the new one in place and hooked up with one hdmi connection…and it didn’t do 4k. WTF! So I did some research and realized the roku stick that we use for amazon prime, hulu, and Netflix…wasn’t 4k compatible. So I went online, ordered a Roku Premier. I got it the next day, thanks amazon. Hooked it up, and it worked well…but the remote had to be line of site with the roku box. Unfortunately, my home theater setup made this a huge pain in the butt because the roku was hidden behind the Yamaha surround sound receiver. So, I returned this and ordered the Roku Streaming Stick +. Because these are meant to plug in behind the tv or to a surround sound receiver. This in place, and I ran the setup on the roku stick for display and it would do 4k uhd but only in 30hz. Fearing I had bought the wrong one. I took it upstairs to my lg 40” tv and plugged it in, turned on the tv. And the tv recognized the roku stick and I saw the screen go from normal black screen (kinda dark grey really) to true solid black with the HDR logo flashing on screen. When it showed the roku menu, I ran the same display setup and it clicked green check marks next to 4k uhd 30hz, 4k uhd 60hz, 4k hdr 30hz, and 4k hdr 60hz. And the movies (6 underground on Netflix) was just a freaking work of art. So now I knew that it was not the roku stick. So doing more research I found out that my Yamaha rx-v685 surround sound receiver would accept this beautiful signal and would pass through 4k but that the configuration had to be adjusted to do this. So I dug around in the menu, found the setting and clicked it into 4k. It looked okay on the new screen, but didn’t look amazing. So I went back to the google, and found out that my receiver would pass through only 4k uhd 30hz. So…it would look okay. But wouldn’t be jaw dropping. Did some research and found that I needed to buy the newer version of the receiver the RX-v683BL, that was $400 on ebay for a new in box one. It showed up a week later in a damaged box, but was fine cosmetically and functionally. I installed this new receiver with all the same connections and such. And ran the same roku display test, got it to do 4k uhd 30hz, and 4k uhd 60hz but it wouldn’t do 4k hdr 30 or 60. Annoyed at this point, I started scouring everything I could, and started seeing that folks said they solved this problem with better cables. I figured why not. So I found a set that had great reviews on amazon (info below) and those showed up two days later. I ran one of these from the new Yamaha receiver to the tv. Because the roku stick plugged in directly to a port on the back of the tv. Ran the test and got the 4k uhd’s working but only the 4k hdr 30hz working. I wanted the last step because I wanted the 4k resolution with the hdr picture quality with the 60 hz for high speed smooth movements. Annoyed again, I found that the tv instead of using HDMI port 1, needed to have me use HDMI port 2 or 3. I tried that, same. Then I went into the menu for the tv and found that there was a picture setting under settings>watch tv>external inputs>hdmi signal format>select the port 2 I was plugged into now and change it from standard to enhanced 4:4:4 or 4:2:2 mode. Tried again, the image was looking better but the roku still wouldn’t let me have the 4k hdr 60hz. So I checked the Yamaha receiver and the HDMI mode had to be in mode 1 as well as the roku stick had to be in ports 1-5. I ran the test again…still no luck. A final run at google and someone said there was a buried adjustment within the settings>advanced system settings>HDMI output and it also had to be set to the 4:4:4 or 4:2:2. Ran the settings and success! So when I boil it all down, when hooking something up to a 4k UHD HDR10(60hz) tv you need to have the correct device, the correct settings on the device, the right cable, the right port plugged in for the device, and also have the settings enabled for that device. I know that was long winded, but I figure I’ll use this story in the amazon review and maybe it helps someone sometime.

  What’s not slow about this thing? Maybe the amazon delivery. Everything else is slow! The remote will turn on my tv but then the Roku stick won’t respond to the remote for like 30 seconds. The download speed is much slower compared to my last Roku 4 that had a hard line. The image quality is worse. Everything about this thing is worse than the Roku 4. I ended up replacing the 4 with this one because the fan in the Roku 4 started whining horribly. This one doesn’t whine but I can make dinner in the time it takes to load a show.

  I’ve used most every streaming device available and the Roku is by far the most user friendly, the easiest to set up, has the best remote and is overall the best streaming device out there.  Soon after setting up my first Roku Stick+, I ordered another one for our second TV to replace the Roku Premier, which was fine but I liked having a volume control on the Stick+ that was lacking on the Premier.

  I love this streaming stick. It is my first foray into streaming and it’s rather a Wonderland! It has worked perfectly. I haven’t integrated it with my Echo Dot yet and I don’t think the remote is a voice remote (?) so that’s why I couldn’t rate those two in this review. I read several reviews online before purchasing this Roku streaming stick+ and the reviews were very good and inspired confidence in this little device. So I purchased it and I’m glad I did. The reviews said that you get a lot of bang for the buck and it seems to be true. When you activate it however and it asks you to type in your email address, you have to hit the OK button to go to the next screen. I was confused by that and was trying to use the up-and-down arrows to get down to the area to type in the email address. They should put the words “press OK” because it wasn’t obvious to me that that was what I should do to toggle to the next screen. I wasted a bunch of time trying to figure it out. When in doubt, press OK!!🤷‍♀️

  I LOVE my ROKU.  I recently re did my cable/streaming set up.  I now only get internet.  There are so many other options out there that will cut your cable bill in half and in my case in fourths.  I get free NETFLIX with my T-mobile phone plan.  I am a member of AMAZON prime so I get streaming with them.  I added HULU and I'm golden.  I do not miss my cable, HUZZAH!!This little stick has a VERY small footprint.  It plugs right into the back of my TV, it has all the features plus a voice recognition ( I have not tried yet) like their small ROKU box.  You can program it to do just about ANYTHING a cable box does.  It is ridiculously easy to use the interface is VERY FRIENDLY.  Try it, you'll like it.  I am very happy with my purchase.

  The stick itself seems great. The way the stick is made you have to plug straight in. Almost all TVs are flat wall mounted with HMDI ports in rear. This made it impossible to inbox and immediately play. We had to purchase a dongle adapter to allow the stick to hang freely. Most adapters are in packs of 2 or 3- so now I have extra I don’t need. It would have been nice to have one in the box.Once plugged it- setup was easy. Pairing with Alexa wasn’t in the automatic set up and so I have to go and figure out how that works.I like that you can just download a few channels and it’s not a lot of unnecessary scrolling since this is for a young child tv. Parent controls were easy to set up.

  After a few months of using the cheaper basic Roku, I decided to upgrade to the Streaming Stick+, though I couldn't seem to get answers to some tech questions here or on their website.The video is wonderfully clear when streaming from my desktop computer or when streaming from the Xfinity streaming service - or through the Roku channel for that matter.  I think some serious upscaling is going on. The sound is amazing streaming from my computer, but be aware that most streaming services don't broadcast in surround sound - you'll have to settle for stereo until they decide there's enough demand for it.Set up was mostly easy, except that in my case, there was some sort of glitch that caused streaming errors at first. The solution was simple: go into settings and find the ""restart"" option, and then re-install the services you subscribe to.If you rip your own video, you'll find that the Stick won't render vobsubs or PGS subs at all. Those are the subs that come with DVDs and BluRay disks. But you can easily download srt subs from various websites. Streamed movies and TV shows do, of course, have subs that work. The subs are displayed in compact form with a black background for easy reading without getting in the way of opening credits.And here's the question nobody could answer for me: The stick WILL handle the x265 HEVC codec. This is a real advantage if you rip your own video from your disks. HEVC will pack some great clarity into much smaller files.One thing I don't like, is the menu navigation in the media app (where it streams from your computer in the other room). When you go into a folder, and then come back out, the other folders are sometimes not displayed. The solution is to go ""home"" and then enter the app again. Then you can select from all the content. The same bug was in the cheap Roku, so I think they don't know about it.Given the price, this is a compact workhorse that will deliver your entertainment reliably in hi-def. Pretty much anything I watch from now on will come through this little stick, except for when I play a physical disk.

  I have had a Roku for years, works great finally died after all the hard work at dead. I bought this one and now they’re forcing you to pay $100 on top of what you purchased the item for before you can use it. They said it has something to do with them right now running their own servers. So no if you buy it you will also have another fee unless you have a Roku account that you already purchased with that $100.

  In fairness I am giving this 1 star based on my experience so far of trying to install the Roku stick since I haven't been able to test my new Roku.  Because of the poor design of having the power cable connect on the side of the Roku stick it is sure to cause interference problems on many TV's (mine included). Roku must know this is an issue since in the instructions they note that if it doesn't fit they will ship you a free adapter 4-5 days after you discover you can't use your Roku stick.  Including the adapter in the box would have been a nice customer satisfier even if it is not needed for some installations. However, it is a major dissatisfier to not include it and make customers wait another 5 days to get their product workable. Hopefully the stick will perform better than the installation process (once I get my adapter next week), but not impressed with Roku so far.

  Reviews from 2018 suggested that Roku was charging $79  per additional Roku to update and activate more than two of their devices.  I ordered this from Amazon and two more from Best Buy and had no difficulty activating any of them.  All work well.  I gave it four stars in part  because my wife's hands are shaky and I could not find a Roku remote with large buttons that would do everything that the included  manufacturer's remote does.  Also because  (in part) the voice search is not currently working when signed into an app -- and it was working until a few days ago.  And also because at the time of this review they had not worked out a contract with Spectrum to include their app.  Roku is now saying in the ad for this device that there is no charge for support ""of any kind.""  Nor have I had any problems with respect to upgrading the software.  So four stars instead of three.

  I have finally been able to sit down (Covid 19 stay at home order) to install Roku.  When I did, it comes up with Missing Advanced Wireless Receiver.  I have installed the Receiver that came with this item.  If another receiver is needed, then there is some level of deception.  If no other AWR is needed except what came in the box which is what I believe, then the product is defective.  I was about to have it replaced but my return window is passed by 2 days.  That is unfair that I have to purchase a new product due to a defective AWR.  Why would I need a AWR if my product came with a long range wireless receiver?

  I have an old Sony Bravia that of course worked well with cable, that I use in my bedroom. But because I recent went to all streaming (to get away from the crazy high cost of cable). It needed and upgrade.This unit gave my old Sony new life.I’d tell anyone in the same circumstances not to through there old tv’s out—Give it new life with a Roku Stick.

  This is an update to my earlier review (see below).  I received the free extension cord from Roku, and it did solve the problem, so I have upgraded my rating to four stars.  But since Roku is well aware of the problem, they should be supplying this cord with all shipments so that customers don't have to waste a lot of time sorting out the issue.I was not aware of this before I bought it, but evidently this device is not adequately designed to dissipate heat very well.  This shows up whenever we watch something with HDR on Amazon Prime.  Evidently Amazon HDR makes the stick work extra hard and heat builds up to the point where you get an onscreen warning that the unit is overheating.  Netflix shows are fine.  Roku has a ""fix"" where they'll send you a free extension cord to try to move the device farther away from the TV, but according to a number of users on the Roku users group, this does not always fix the problem.  I have sent for the extension cord, but in the meantime, we can't watch Amazon HDR shows.

  Roku stick is advertised with 3 months free Apple TV. Amazon says deal is over and there is nothing you can do but return the product. I believe if it’s advertised on amazon and sold by amazon warehouse they should go er what they advertise

  I actually purchased a firestick before this and I returned that to purchase the roku stick. My main complaint witht eh firestick was the fact that the default home screen was too cluttered with too many things going on. It also tried to keep pushing some prime video content which I did not appreciate. And the screen mirroring with laptop did not seem to work on the firestick. I've been using the roku stick for a couple weeks now and I am very pleased with it. The screen mirroring works fine with my laptop though there is some input delay. However, watching movies using screen mirroring works fine. The home screen by itself is not cluttered and only shows the apps you have installed which is a huge plus for me. My friend had an older roku stick which was very slow but this one is very fast and breezy. The voice integration works perfectly and something I love about it is the fact that when you ask it for a movie/tv show, it shows you all the streaming services the movie/tv show is available on which is super helpful. The roku store also has a ton of screensavers and wallpapers so you can customize it exactly the way you want. I was a little surprised the box didn't come with a HDMI extender, like the firestick did. But it wasn't a big deal because roku ships it to you for free if you provide the serial number on your roku stick. The HDMI extender is tiny however and that was a bummer for me because I wanted to use the extender to have the stick right beside my TV instead of behind it to get higher wifi strenght. Overall, as somebody who has used the firestick and roku stick, I would recommend the roku stick 100%!

  Bought a new one yesterday and plugged it into my TV. Completed the initial setup steps like Language selection , Remote pairing and Wifi selection. The stick said it needed a software update and will reboot. Post the reboot, the stick would flash the initial startup logo and then just shutdown..Extremely disappointed with the purchase . Wish Roku had better QC in place.  No phone help.  Cant find anywhere on help forums ame issue.  Only place i can find exact problem is on amazon reviews.  Im sending back.  This thing should work!!!!!

  I got the Roku Streaming Stick+ to replace a ChromeCast.  The Roku gave me the thumbs up as being HDCP 1.4 compliant during setup.  After painfully typing in my long Netflix password using the dpad it then proudly displayed a HDCP refusing to work.  I'd like to point out the ChromeCast enforces DRM and HDCP checks too and had no problem.  If you are doing ANYTHING more than plugging this Roku directly into a TV don't bother.  It's not worth the HDCP headache.  Literally refused to work with anything despite validating my setup during install.  If they refuse to accept HDCP 1.4 connections it'd be nice to know that before requiring me to setup an account and requiring me to setup a method of payment on the account to even finish creating the account.  Awful.  All around.  1 star.

  Remote would randomly stop working and would only reconnect if batteries were removed and reinserted. Batteries are new. Did this about once per day. Worse than this, 4K video streams from Netflix or Hulu have horrible video quality, with blocking, streaking, and off-color artifacts, especially in dark areas of the picture. Same exact content when viewed through my smart TV’s apps (also over wireless-this is on a 65” Vizio) is beautiful and free of all artifacts. I prefer using a Roku due to the simplicity of the interface, but I had to return this one.

  I was still using the 1st generation fiestick in the room I put this in, and it was not the slightest improvement.  I don't know why they redesigned so much about the parental controls on this thing, when it still doesn't give me any more specific control. I was hoping I could filter what apps are available. Nope. It's either only for little kids or only for adults. No more specific than that. After a few weeks struggling with it, it was ruined after the blackout. I certainly would never waste a dime buying it again.

  This clearly is a lemon and now I can't return as I missed the deadline due to trying to get back from Covid restrictions.  By the time I did get back and checked this, was too late.  All I want is to replace it and now I have no idea how to do that because it's so difficult to reach anyone on here.  Please see this whoever matters.  I'm sure it's a good product but this doesn't work and I watched every tutorial, had my tech son work on it but nothing.How do you get any service on here?  I did send message directly to ROKU but haven't heard.I will write a real review if I get to have the product that works.  Thank you and my apologies as I normally don't rant on here, but provide a real review of a product which helps people to purchase with honest reviews.

  I had to change the batteries 3 times in less than a month. Remote would randomly die. Not sure if it’s a glitch or not, but I returned it. Also when turning on the tv the hdmi input would work on there first try 70% of the time. I returned it, I’ll stick with my FireStick for now. Also if using the Xfinity stream app, you can pause live tv! You can pause live tv with the FireStick though.

  You can tell they spend all their time with adds and stupid themes that you never ask for.  Real problem is that IT DOESN'T WORK.  First it was the audio would disappear and we'd have to unplug and plug it back it 5 times, now the remote does nothing half the time.  Not sure if it's the remote or the thing plugged in... But I assure you, they make sure you get their stupid adds and themes just right... So if you like adds and stupid holiday themes grab it up, if you'd like this POS to work, this ain't the one.  HEY ROKU LET ME RETURN THIS POS AND I'LL CHANGE MY REVIEW, IF IT WORKS FOR MORE THAN 3 MONTHS.

  Well, after a week of troubleshooting attempts, I've thrown in the towel and decided to return this, my first Roku product. While the UX is quite good (fast, reasonably well designed), and the feature set is appealing, there were two problems for me that led to this outcome:1. Surround sound issue due to lack of Dolby Digital support for older equipmentDuring my fall into the Roku support forum rabbit hole, I learned that there are two varieties of Dolby surround: Dolby Digital (DD) and Dolby Digital Plus (DD+). Providers such as Disney+ provide surround audio in DD+, but not DD; my older receiver (a Denon) can't decode the former, so I only get stereo audio from those programs. Competing streaming devices apparently can convert DD+ to DD in these cases, but the Roku can't (in spite of what the available device settings would lead you to believe). Comments in the forums suggest that some older Roku models can perform this conversion, and that this product used to until recent Roku updates.As a work-around, I routed the Roku through my Blu-ray player, which can process DD+ streams. Not as convenient, but not a deal-breaker on its own.2. Video stutters after rewind on Netflix, Disney +I've observed this problem on Netflix and Disney +, on multiple shows. (I hadn't tried any other services.) Typically, when I play a program for the first time, motion is pretty smooth; no noticeable artifacts. However, If I rewind the program a bit and then play, I see a choppiness that seems to be a frozen frame every 1/4 sec. or so. This is most noticeable on pans and slow zooms. (Some might describe this as a stutter.) The effect is sufficiently severe to make this a deal-breaker for me.I went through the troubleshooting steps covered on the support forums, with no success. I also have a Comcast X1 box with Netflix; I tested the same shows on that device, but could not reproduce the problem there. So it sure seems that the problem lies with the Roku.So, given all of the above, I'm giving up on this product. Customers with more recent gear might not encounter the problems I did, but for others this would be something to consider before choosing this as your streaming device.

  Easy to set up? You would think it is just a matter of plugging it into the TV by the description. Well, it has to be in view of the remote, which probably not the case by plugging it directly into the TV. In my TV the stick is too long to plug into the TV.So you need the HDMI but you will also need a male to female HDMI adapter which doesn’t come with the product.While you may have enough power cord to plug into the USB port in the TV, USB power probably isn’t enough so you should go into a wall plug. The cords sent will probably not reach if you still want to keep the stick in view, so you will need an extension cord.The Get Started instructions fail to go into detail especially about where the stick has to be placed and a need for the HDMI.I decided it wasn’t worth it. I replugged in my old Roku and returned the stick.

  I like this 2019 Roku Stick + better than the previous (2017) version primarily because it puts off less heat.  The previous stick version would physically get very hot.  Then intermittently  a warning would come up on the screen that it was overheating.To resolve that, the power had to be cut to let it cool down.  I purchased a USB hub with power buttons to do that daily.  So far the new version has not felt as hot to the touch nor has a warning popped up.The new version also has a small box integrated into the USB power cord.  This may be the resolution for the heat problem.Other than that, this new version also has includes a mute button on the remote.  It is supposed to have a quad core processor.  I have not noticed any significant speed increase how it operates.  I will say that the sticks have 802.11ac network capability that makes them run better than the Roku Express. which only has up to 802.11n network speed.As for voice recognition, that does not work as well as I would hope.  Many times it does not recognize what I am saying.  So I don’t use it.I purchased many of these for home and as gifts as they were on sale in December for $29 each, which was a good deal.  I have had good feedback from others that it works well.I recommend the Roku Stick + of you want a fast, cooler streaming channel device.By the way, as of this time, the CBS Roku app will not allow use without a CBS ALL ACCESS subscription.  The smart phone app does allow broadcast show access at no extra cost, which can be streamed to a Google Chromecast device, not to Roku.  That is CBS’ choice.

  Was looking forward to replace my clunky ""old-reliable"" Roku box with the sleek Roku Stick. Last night, within 45 minutes of the 1st use, it overheated and I received the following message on my Samsung SmartTV “Your device is overheating”.  The stick overheated 3 times within 90 minutes. Each time, the stick was very hot. I followed the ""Unplug & wait 10 minutes until the unit is cool"" directions. My TV sits on a cabinet. There are no other electronic devices near the TV and there's 10 inches between the back of the TV and the wall. I'm returning the stick and will reinstall my trusty Roku box.

  When it comes to streaming media devices, IMHO Roku is the brand to beat.  I already had an older Roku, which I've used since 2012.  When I decided to move it into my bedroom, I realized I wanted something more than the few ""smart"" apps on my living room TV.  After doing some research I chose to get a Roku Streaming Stick+, and fell in love with it immediately.My girlfriend's bedroom TV had absolutely no ""smart"" features, so I got her a Streaming Stick+; but she decided she didn't want to get into the habit of watching TV in bed (except for the morning newscasts) and gave it to her daughter.  A few months later, she upgraded her bedroom TV -- larger and better screen, but again no ""smart"" apps -- and then she injured her hip and had to spend a couple of weeks off her feet as much as possible.  Ity was nearly Christmas anyway, so I bought her another Streaming Stick+, and this time she loved it!  (She's hooked on ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"".)Then I decided to give a Streaming Stick+ to my sister for Christmas.  Yep, she loves it too!  She prefers classic movies and TV series from her childhood, and the various Roku channels have a wealth of such programming.  Dhr has hinted that she wouldn't mind having a second Streaming Stick+, for her bedroom TV; so I may be guying my fifth one soon.  Or perhaps my fifth and sixth, since the Streaming Stick+ has a few channels available that my original Roku doesn't seem to have.

  The latest update to the “new fire tv”  took a great interface experience and made it laborious and very user unfriendly.  The apps are smaller, harder to see. You have to go through a lot of stuff they are trying to sell you before you can get back to what you were watching last (7 rows down instead of 1st row) I have a hard time imagining any purpose for this upgrade except some tech saying “look I changed a whole lot of stuff”  trying to justify their paycheck.Great Job of taking a silk purse and turning it into a sows ear!

  Seems to work just as well as our regular fire stick in the living room. We got this one for our family room TV. Connects well. Really enjoy that we are able to connect to our dish Network app and watch dish on our other TV now instead of having to pay Dish Network to use their Joey.

  I have to restart my fire stick almost every time I use it because it doesn’t want to play sound. I thought it was my tv at first, but the regular cable worked just fine and the fire stick was fine after restarting. Really inconvenient since I’ve only had it for about a month... unfortunately I think at this point I can’t return or exchange it. Overall not impressed with the quality of the fire stick, but I definitely see the benefits of having it make any tv into a smart tv.

  This turns a regular TV into a smart TV. My only issue is that the second day I had it I thought the TV had broken, I had no sound. I checked everything with the TV even unplugged it and plugged back in and still no sound. Then I was thinking maybe it has something to do with the fire stick. I unplugged it and plugged back in and sound was fine. This has happened 8 think 3 times within about 4 days. Kind of a pain. Other than that I like what it does.

  This device freezes my tv up A LOT! I can be in the middle of a movie, right at the end, and it freezes up. Turning tv off and on, unplugging firestick and plugging back in, and even turning the internet off and on doesn't even help. I have to leave it overnight before it will start up again. And this time, it didn't even do that. I thought the issue was with my internet, so I upgraded my internet, sent a Cox technician out who changed settings, but the tv still froze up. Then I switched to GoogleFiber internet a couple days later, that didn't help either. I don't know what to do at this point except to return the Firestick.

  Absolutely love the fire stick. It instantly made our TV smart by providing smart features. I love all of the apps and it even has access to other things like Amazon shopping, free games to play on the TV, you can ask questions like measurement conversions using the voice recognition on the remote. It's small so it doesn't take up a lot of space. It hooks up to the hdmi port on the TV. Love it. I actually bought a 2nd one after trying this out. I'm about to get rid of my cable bill.

I got the youtubetv trial and I am enjoying this. I should gotten this along time ago.

  I picked this up to throw in a small TV to put in the garage or move out on the deck. It's great when we're working on stuff or just hanging out outside to be able to put something on to watch or listen to like sports or what have you. The inexpensive stuff means I won't cry if someone steals it, but as with most Fire TV products it works really well.If you're looking for an inexpensive way to stream TV and you're part of the Amazon ecosystem, you cannot go wrong with this.

  I have to say that it is a great streaming device. I don’t mind that I can’t control volume or channel with the remote. What I do care is how the fire stick brought the tv back to life. I already have a smart tv and I can watch Netflix and all that but when I watch it streaming it through the fire stick, the tv’s picture is enhanced. I am very pleased and will recommend. If I have to say something to work on it might be the fact that when I turn off the tv, the next day I have to reset or restart the fire stick because the apps don’t have volume, but once I restart which is super fast everything goes back to have volume.

  Overall a good device, easy to use and customize with your favorite apps, however, a technical issue causes it to frequently boot up without sound, requiring a restart before it will work properly again. It reboots fairly quickly, but I feel like they've created enough of these fire sticks now that a simple, essential feature like sound should work at least 99% of the time.

  I don't use the voice recognition ....still ""old fashion"" and not a fan of all voice activated stuff.  I do watch some of the movies and the applications that are free (I'm cheap).  I already have a membership to Netflix (it was a gift) which I can also access through the firestick. Took me a bit to get it working correctly (I'm not a ""techy"") but now that I have it working I'd say it was well worth the purchase and do recommend.

  When I first received this, I was constantly having to reset it to work. After talking with support, who was excellent, I reset it to factory and it has worked fine. Bummer was I lost all the apps I had put on it, but having it work was a better trade-off. Apps are easy to install or delete. Customer Service, after I wrote a one star review, contacted me by phone within 10 mins of submitting it. Now that's customer service! Thank you CS.

  I've owned quite a few Fire Sticks over the years, and they changed very slightly if at all. This new one has a different format, so can I take a little getting used to, however I could not get it to sync with my echo Dot. My previous firesticks had no problems. Perhaps because my echo dot is old, but it was extremely frustrating the amount of work I had to put into getting one Alexa device to link with another. It should be seamless and require no effort.

  Was not able to use HBOMax with Comcast & Smart TV because we did not subscribe through Comcast. TV Stick Lite worked like a charm. Only negative is the remote is sluggish- takes a long time to advance show selection manually . Voice recognition was very good. Very easy to set up. Well worth the expense.  Don't use Alexa although I would like to use the Echo to mirror what's on TV (watchHBO) but have not figured out how to do it yet.

  This Firestick freezes at least once a day and the only way to get it back and rebooted is to pull the power connection out and reinstall it. This is totally unacceptable and I am going to return it to Amazon and choose a new replacement. I have had at least 4 or 5 Firesticks over the years and this is the second one that has had problems. This one worked very up until the time the image froze. Hope I have better luck next one.

  Again another half baked idea from Amazon, What good is it if you need two remotes. ( aka TV remote & firestick) to operate your TV. For the price at Best Buy of 17.99 i guess it was worth it verses buying a 1k of 4 new smart TV's. The main problem is going from Hulu, to Prime to Netflix the remote gets stuck and will not let you change services or shows in the middle of a show. You will always have to end an APP and restart surfing otherwise your locked out. Amazon does offer the full remote for $30 but again does the same thing function wise except TV controls are included. Just watch out for all of the add-on's which aren't free and a click of a button and you bought the farm. WARNING KEEP THE REMOTES AWAY FROM YOUR KIDS OR THEY WILL BE BUYING EVERYTHING WITH A CLICK OF A BUTTON AND YOUR CREDIT CARD ON FILE YOUR DONE.

I had a bulky console for my kids room prior to this, and now with the stick it takes up less room, no long cables, parental controls are awesome (timers and passwords especially), and with my prime I have access to a ton of shows. However, right off the bat the remote is glitchy. I thought maybe it was too far from the unit or some kind of interference but nothing has helped. Even standing right by the stick does nothing. It set up fine but once all the updates happened it started skipping or not responding. Probably just need a new remote. Love the product otherwise!

  I decided to use my 12-year old plasma television in my bedroom when I bought a new television for the living room. Didn't want to get another cable box and my son recommended getting an Amazon Firestick. The firestick works just as good without the cable box on streaming content. I don't watch much in my bedroom, but having the firestick on my old plasma, I've been streaming shows without interrupting other viewers in the living room.

  After returning the first one because it permanently froze and would not reset I became frustrated with the replacement when I needed to reset it every few days by unplugging and plugging it in. Other than that it is the same thing less the volume controls.

  I love this device. My Panasonic TV was too old to have access to Netflix and Amazon Prime so I purchase the FireTV device. I'm glad I did as the app on the TV only plays through the TV speakers whereas the FireTV is hooked into my A/V receiver so it gets full Dolby surround sound. The only drawback is that I have to use my A/V remote to control the sound and switch back and forth between the FireTV device and my AT&T U-Verse box.

  When it works, it works fine although the navigation is late/slow to respond when you push the button on the remote.  The unfortunate issue is that about once a week, the audio stops working requiring us to unplug and plug the Fire Stick back in to reboot the stick and get the audio working again.

  I am not completely able to use the product for which I bought it for. This product used to stream DISH. I don't know when it quit but it did. I am able to stream Amazon and Netflix but I watch a lot of dish. I tried to get help with a chat and he was speaking way over my head. He didn't know how to translate it to layman's terms. I was given a phone number to call. When I called the phone number I was placed on hold indefinitely. This is on my cell phone that has limited minutes. I am completely wireless right now and this is not going how I thought it would. Very frustrating trying to get through to customer service. There is no way to leave a message. I even have a ticket and there's no way to enter that information or to get them to call me back. I am not going to use my precious minutes for Dead air. If I don't get this hooked up in the next week I will send it back. It's already been two weeks.

  What a cheap remote control first time I dropped it from less than a foot above my wood floor it stopped working. Tried everything but the cheap remote although looks great doesn't work. I would have bought a Fire Stick but they and Xfinity are at odds and Xfinity won't give them permission to have the Xfinity app on a fire stick so I pay the price lol!

  We bought this Roku about two months ago. It streams nicely. One big problem has come up. When you you navigate from one item to another after about three item it jams up and stop working for about 5 or 10 minutes. So we’re ever you end up when it jams your stuck on that movie or item. I would suggest you buy a different stick and this does not seem to have robust processing power to allow you to easily move around. I was very disappointed in this product. In the past Roku was the best but now I am stuck with one that is definitely not very good.

  This device works great, as long as you don't mind replacing the remote batteries every few days. For some reason they are drained with 2-4 days, depending on usage (confirmed by battery meter). From information available online, this is a longstanding issue and ROKU has no interest in resolving it. I complained about this issue thru chat support and was promised an email response, but after 2 weeks no response was forthcoming. Based on other reviews, it is unlikely I will ever hear from ROKU (if I am wrong, ROKU, respond to this review).

  This is our second steaming stick, for our spare bedroom. We've been using our first streaming stick for about 6 months. We replaced our very old (but still functioning) Roku when it wouldn't stream Disney+. We love our streaming stick. It loads apps like Netflix and Disney+ immediately. Navigating within the apps is easy and intuitive. We paired the remote with our TV, and now only use the original remote when we need to switch the TV input away from our Roku. We even took it traveling, and were able to quickly set up the hotel TV to stream our favorite shows.

  This works great for wireless connection and picture quality, but...1) The stick does not support IR (Infrared) communication. It will only use RF (Radio Freq) communication, so you are locked into using this remote (or a universal remote that supports RF). I watch more than just the Roku, so I need to change the input on my TV. The Roku stick+ will NOT allow you to do change input on your TV.2) Be aware, there is a scam! If you try to connect more than 2 Roku devices from your home and get the ""003 error"". If you call the number shown, they will give you some BS story about paying anywhere from $70 to $150 to get it connected. Hang up! Go to the settings on your Roku and reset the stick. It will give you a new valid ID.I returned the Stick+ and purchased the Roku Ultra. The Ultra supports IR and login via your computer to your existing Roku account when you setup your new Roku.

  RETURNING; Useless - literally.Still waiting for necessary HDMI extension to SHIP from Roku(!? almost 1 week...).Roku offers it for free which I guess would be nice, so why not have it in the package already? - especially since they were obviously prepared with an answer to what, I would extrapolate, is a not-uncommon issue of the ""stik"" being too large to fit in limited size HDMI plug-in area on/behind the TV?Instead, $50 paperweight - not for long...Amazon would be wise to offer the extender right along side;""Free"" from Roku is entirely irrelevant if you don't have it.Disappointed as this was our first forray into ""cut cord"", and this device - per extensive research- was our choice as it was otherwise rated well...

  It's such as amazon sham to depict the Disney quick button on the remote in all their images to only send you the original ESPN button on the remote which was their original set.  I wanted what was depicted which was the ""Netflix, Hulu, Disney, Sling""  what I got was Netflix, Hulu, ESPN, Sling""They should send you the correct remote that is advertised an option or which remote you want.  I'll be speaking with Disney that amazon is not sending people the Disney remote they advertise and paying Roku a lot of money for.

  I bought this streaming stick specifically to take with me when I travel. I stay in a lot of hotels and some of them don't have smart TVs. For the ones that do, I don't want them to store my credentials for streaming services.  Having read the reviews and thinking I had done my research, I was confident I made the right choice with the Roku streaming stick. It sounded ideal for my situation, but it turns out connecting to the hotel wifi is a disaster with this thing.I'll preface this with saying I'm an IT consultant and have an extensive background setting up many wireless devices. I've tried 2 different Marriotts in two different states and the method of connecting the device to authenticate simply doesn't work when it requires loading a webpage. I ended up having to connect my laptop to the hotel wifi, enable the hotspot feature, and connect the roku to that in order to work. In other words, I have to have my laptop on if I want the roku to work at all times. It's advertised as a standalone device that can do this by itself.What this device needs is a way to directly open the authentication webpage for hotel wifi directly in the roku interface instead of the method of connecting to the roku via wifi and trying to complete all the steps before the connection troubleshooter turns off the roku access point. It times out too quickly to finish the steps. I tried with 3 different devices: My laptop, phone, and tablet. Each time, the roku timed out the connection before the steps could be completed.I realize not all people are in my situation where they need to travel often. Connecting to your home network is easy and the device works well when it does connect, but having it advertised as working easily with hotel wifi networks that authenticate with a webpage is misleading. I'm planning on using a firestick instead for travel.

  Dont waste your money on this. After 2 weeks using it, the remote stop to works, i changed the batteries, worked for another week, then failed again. I was checking the status of the remote batteries from the Roku Home, and after change the batteries, were on 100%, one day after that, 89%, 5 more days, the remote was dead and they make you to buy a new control for the device.Also the amazon support request to send the device back to them, to check the device and make a refund of the money.After check on google about this matter, a lot of people have the same issue, so this means that amazon sell this devices know it that the device is deffected.Again, do not waster your money on this.

  I've had two Roku's for less than a month.  Both have presented simple black screens and they are non-responsive to remote inputs.  This has forced me to power cycle them.  This isn't a problem for those techno minded, but it is a hassle to have to be the frequent IT person in the house.  The remotes that come with the Roku are not ergonomical.  I have accidently hit the volume mute and down buttons frequently when simply grabbing the device.  The remote is to small to have such controls on the side.Even with these issues, I'm still overall happy that I cut the cable and went with Roku.

  Easy setup. Really easy; easier than the Amazon Fire TV. I got this to replace my Fire TV box, being on the fifth one now; it was pretty unreliable. The Roku also gets the Amazon Prime TV, and has dedicated pushbuttons for Hulu, Netflix etc. Part of the setup is to get it to recognize the TV so it's single-button on-off, volume control from the Roku control, also nice. It has much better wifi sensitivity than my old Fire TV box, too. The only mildly annoying part of setup is that you have to go to Roku.com/connect to activate it and finish the setup. Otherwise, it's a snap, took maybe 10 minutes to install and activate Prime, Netflix, and Hulu.

  Third update.  Just keeps getting worse. What was saved with the app on my phone is no longer saved as app has stopped recognizing my roku stick so it is completely unusable.  Crazy enough but it still loads on my TV but with a dud remote and a dud app, there is no way for me to control it for use.  Utter junk product.Second update: it's only gotten worse. I've had to re-pair the roku remote several times while I'll had it. Now the remote is completely dead. Since there are no buttons on the roku stick,  I was worried I wouldn't be able to use it at all. Then I downloaded the app and use my phone to control it. It isn't ideal but at least I can still use my Roku.  Maybe I just got a dud but I still stand by my statement that my old Roku is much more stable.  I won't be buying another Roku stick.Update: not even 2 years in and the remote doesn't work properly. Volume buttons and power button no longer register.  Batteries are new and the roku says they're full strength but the remote still doesn't work right.Original review: Far more glitchy than my original old Roku

  I always need a roku, even with a SmartTV, because of the number of apps available. I have been a loyal user since the first version of the box.I'm happy with this stick except for one small thing (and i do mean small): the power cord is really, really short. Unbelievably short. Unless your TV sits on the ground right next to the power outlet (with the wall outlet fortunately on the same side of the television as the HDMI ports), this cannot be plugged in without a weighty extension cord, which will put strain on the device. Not sure what they were thinking. Surely one of the designers must own an actual television and realize that it's very rare for an HDMI port to be only 3 feet or less from a wall outlet. You either need to get a longer M-F HDMI cable in which to plug the stick, or you can do as I did and plug the stick into a switcher and plug the switcher directly into the TV's HDMI port. There is really no way to plug the stick directly into the TV.Hopefully they'll figure out what a tragic mistake they've made and provide a significantly longer power cord next time.

  The beauty of this stick is that you can plug it into your TV or receiver's USB port as long as the port has sufficient amps to power it. Most modern TVs and receivers do. This way there is no extra power cord dangling from your beautiful wall mounted TV.The problem is that Roku's engineering team really screwed up. Unlike every single other product on the market that remembers the pairing of a remote to the device, Roku's doesn't. So when you shut off your TV or receiver that is powering your Roku stick, then the remote does into pairing mode. It will attempt to find, and pair with, the Roku device until either you turn the TV back on (thus powering up the Roku stick) or until the batteries die. with typical usage having a TV off most of the day and at night while you are sleeping, the batteries in the remote will be dead in 2-3 days.This is unacceptable. Discussion forums on Roku's site have pages and pages of comments on this. Once thread has 122 pages and was closed, only to have a new thread opened.Roku has no fix for this.So, if you are planning on keeping your Roku powered 24/7 by plugging it directly into the wall (and you don't mind having that extra power drain on your utility bill) then the product is fine. But if you are going to power this from your TV, receiver, or a switched outlet (or otherwise have it unpowered when you aren't using it) then the product is useless as you will need to replace the remote batteries every couple of days or alternatively yank the batteries every time you turn your TV off.

  I bought a new TV for my office/craft room and I wanted a new Roku with updated software to go with it.  I bought this on Black Friday so I got it for a great price.  It only took a few minutes to set it up because everything automatically popped up on the screen for me to just hit enter.  I love that it turns my tv on/off and also controls the volume so for the most part, I can use this remote for everything except changing channels when I watch local stations with the aerial.  I will use the tv remote for that.  This Roku remote has voice control and can also be integrated with Alexa.  I haven’t set that up yet but I’m sure it will be a breeze the same way setting it up on the tv was.  I’m very pleased with this purchase.  I have Roku on all my TVs around the house.  I find it easy to navigate and find what I’m looking for.

  Speed is good. Remote suffers periods of non-responsiveness when you first turn the TV on and therefore power the stick on. The voice search has limited usefulness. It says it doesn't support sports. It doesn't work inside of Youtube TV. If you try to use it, it takes you out of the youtube tv app. I saw others complaining about the remote not having a mute button. The one I received had a remote with a mute button. I think this is relatively new as the remote for same roku stick I bought on Black Friday from Walmart.com did not have a mute button. The price was cheaper I guess because it was old stock (with the old remote with no mute) that was being liquidated.  Product ordered going foward will have the remote with the mute button I am guessing.

  Been using a few weeks now and been very pleased with how capable this device is until today. It has begun to overheat while streaming 4k content (the reason I didn't get a cheaper one was to watch 4k...). This unit was extremely hot to the touch. I have it mounted on the back of my open air tv setup with the AC power adapter for reference. I have ordered the HDMI cord in hopes that getting it away from the tv helps but Im skeptical as it is winter right now and my living room is the coolest it will be all year. The streaming stick+ while packed with features cannot dissipate heat well on it's own sadly and is design flaw. After some quick searches this is a wide spread issue so not just a oneoff issue. If the HDMI cord doesnt work I'll probably be asking for a replacement (doubt it'll help)...

  I just want to go on the record and say Roku remotes are crap. I’ve been using Roku since it’s inception, since the first generation Roku. The remotes sucked then (would stop working with good batteries) and it still happens now. I’d love to know the technological issue here - why are Roku remotes so terrible? It’s happened with every Roku I’ve had, which is now about 7. Would love to hear from someone.

  I recently changed my internet provider and was having difficulty getting an older Fire TV device to work with one of the televisions. When this went on sale, the price was really good and having TV remote control wasn't important so I didn't see the point in spending more time on the existing device.  The new Fire stick set up quickly and flawlessly as had every new one I've gotten and has worked well every since.  I'm quite satisfied with it.

  I use the fire stick lite mostly to stream Disney Pkus which is not supported by my internet provider. I ordered two, one for each of our televisions. The order arrived in time. The included directions were clear. The only issue was removing the battery cover. I found the answer on you tube. Use any rubber gloves to make it very easy. The fir sticks were easy to install, and the fire stick gave clear set up instructions. They work just great and are easy to use. The fire stick lite has no volume control, but that is not very important to me. Amazon was having a special which made the cost very reasonable. I would definitely recommend the fire stick lite.

  Prime and Netflix went on the fritz for us about 2 years ago. The screens would fail to load, they'd take FOREVER to load, or it would just plain old crap out.There was nothing wrong with the old fire stick, but apparently Amazon has learned some evil tricks from Microsoft and will force you to upgrade your device in order to run their new shiny software.Well played Amazon.

  What I don’t like that it does not have a on and off button nor does it have a volume control button! What I do like that for the $29.99 price that it’s one of the fastest device out there in that price range! Easy to add extra storage with a flash drive of any number of storage! Picture quality is awesome it has the same Dolby Atmos as the fire cube and it comes with a guide button with built in Alexa!

  I liked how the fire stick works great with lower end internet service.  While watching movies there were no pauses for buffering  The user interface works really slick you can ether navigate with the arrow keys or voice commands.  The price was inexpensive. It also comes with an adapter cable for hard to fit HDMI locations on your TV.

  I was encouraged to order a Fire TV Stick by my millennial niece during a visit to New Orleans. She impressed upon me the usefulness and versatility of a Fire TV Stick especially during a cable connection mishap. I ordered 3 Fire TV Sticks and received them within 2 days of purchase. I returned to my home in another state and low and behold the cable connection was malfunctioning. I called my software engineer son to explain my challenge with the cable connection and I can't make this up, he asked if I had a FIRE TV STICK! Within an hour he guided me through the process of setting up my FiresTV Stick and I was able to view my favorite programs for 2 days - the length of time it took for my cable company to send out a technician.

  This would have been a perfect streaming device except for the following:1. It comes with small storage capacity and I started getting hard disk full error, and I had to delete most apps.2. Unlike ROKU that gives the option of an SD Card, this did not give you that luxury.3. You cannot connect your USB with this.4. Once it disconnects with your wifi modem, you virtually had to restart is like 2ce before it reconnects.5. It cannot shut off your TV or increase volume even though its a smart TV, they just dont mix.What I love about it is1. The picture clarity is super sharp2. the News channel app can be grouped so you dont need to start searching for the app in the app store3. Voice Assistant is good with search mode4. It integrated with my Echo Dot very easily.Overall Ill give it a 3 because the disk space is just to small. I have removed all my installed apps to like 7 apps and Im still seeing the disk full error. Just so annoying.

  Please read through the 3 star reviews. A lot of people are having the same audio problem. Often this starts up with no sound so it has to be restarted. Amazon needs to fix this with a software or firmware update, or stop selling a faulty product!I bought this as an upgrade from a much older version and it was definitely worth the modest cost. My old fire stick had become very slow when connecting to streaming feeds. There's only one inconvenience with this new one: every now and then it starts up with no sound output. I must go into the settings and restart it, then it's fine. Not a big deal, just a small annoyance. I hope it doesn't get worse over time. Maybe a software update will fix it?

I can watch regular TV or switch over to my Fire Stick and watch a series or movie at NO EXTRA COST!!! for a senior citizen that means a lot!!!

  I desperately needed to replace my old Fire Stick that was years old.  The remote was unpredictable and the unit was very slow.  Love this one for the voice response.  For $17 I was willing to sacrifice the volume and on/off control on the unit as I use it on a TV that I don't use very much.  If that's a concern, spend the extra money and get the more expensive one but I highly recommend this one.

  I got fed up with cable cost after their last increase and looked for an alternative. I'm 62 and not familiar with all the new tech that's out there, but got a recommendation on the Roku from a Millennial. I ordered the Roku streaming stick to try it out before I cancelled our cable. After receiving it, I plugged it into the HDMI port of the TV, easy onscreen connection to my WiFi and haven't been happier. Immediately cancelled the cable and added YouTube tv for the live news feeds. It's as clear as my cable was and after several months haven't experienced any problems. It had gone out several times, but that was due to a WiFi outage. I would suggest ordering it and try it yourself and insure your WiFi, TV and any other technology you have, is comparable. Old dog learned some new tricks..

  I've being using the Amazon Firestick for a year without any complaints. When needed to buy a second streaming unit, Amazon wouldn't send theirs to a forwarding address. This forced me to buy a different brand: Roku.At the beginning I wasn't happy (resistance to change) but as soon as I started using it all I could say is: WOW!! THIS IS GOOD!Roku is very fast and responsive. The interface can be customized and I believe it is better. I get exactly the same functionality as before, but with a faster response time. I love the fact the the Roku controller can turn on/off the TV and control the volume; makes streaming a bit easier. When the cell is used as a controller, the sound can be heard through earbuds without any noticeable lag.I'm very happy with this streaming stick. Roku is highly recommended, and will never go back.

  (I have reviewed the Fire Stick, since I have purchased both, unable to make up my mind which one I wanted for my 2 smart TVs).  This device has performed flawlessly, although it helps I have the best available residential internet service (Cox Gigablast), cable modem (Arris SB8200) and wifi mesh router (Orbi, with 3 satellites).  Comparing the remote to the one sold with the Fire Stick, I prefer the layout of buttons on the Fire Stick.  The voice button on the Roku remote is hard to find, located in the middle among other buttons.  And the volume buttons are tiny, located on the side where it is too easy to hit the mute button inadvertently.  The large, conspicuous buttons for Netflix, Disney, Hulu, and Sling are nice (since I subscribe to 3 of these services), but are redundant since most of us prefer voice.  Both remotes badly need buttons that light up in the night, similar to the Cox Contour remote I just gave up.  Highly recommend either Stick; you might select based on slight differences of contracted streaming services and whether you need without extra cost an HDMI extension adapter (I did with my Samsung), which for now only comes with the Fire Stick.

  The Roku works great.  However there are a few things I would change.  1.  Roku does not need my credit card information and I dont like having it out there.  I have paid plans directly through providers.  But, you have to provide credit card information to use the Roku.  2.  The remote is nice, a little slow, but works well.  What I don't like is the convenience keys are set for particular providers ( most I don't use).  I would like to set my own convenience buttons to go to the providers I use.  3.  Roku has access to your info when you log into the Youtube channel.  Roku is to ""Big Brother"" invasive for my taste.  I simply don't log onto my Youtube account on the Roku.All in all it streams great and id faily easy to use.  I like that I do have some privacy and security options to choose.

  It has saved my sluggish (and constantly freezing) HiSense 43-inch ""Smart"" LED TV .The tiny Roku stick is blindingly fast to my remote comannds, and manages to control my TV's volume and power from its single remote. It saves all the available wi-fi configs, so less typing passwords when switching to a better signal a/o internet provider.NO voice command outside USA, a inconvenient caveat that was not disclosed anywhere only after the thing is connected to my TV set. Buy the cheaper model that skips ""voice"" command and get the other useful features.

  I just received my first smart TV and the Roku streaming stick+.  It was a learning curve getting it set up, but fairly easy considering I'm not a techie.  Everything works great and the online support for the Roku was concise. The instructions with the stick were simple and well-written.  I'm watching my favorite YouTube shows now.  Unusually enough, YouTube wasn't on the introductory list of channels to link to, but I just asked the internet how to add the YouTube channel and it was easy enough to do.  This from a 60 year old who has not had a TV for 10 years and who has never used a Roku.

  I have 3 Roku devices. One old slow non 4k stick, the Roku Express, and now the Streaming Stick, for 3 TVs. Originally the Express was being used on our primary TV but I bought the Streaming Stick for it because of the additional capabilities of the remote. That works as well as it should. The Streaming Stick, however, is not near the Express as far as visual quality, including clarity and color. And it is also much slower than the Express. I keep all of them updated, and occasionally power cycle them just to keep them cleared of residual bits of data that build during normal use. The Stick requires a reboot or power cycle constantly, especially after shifting from say Hulu to Netflix, or other services. Is it enough to make me drop it and get another Express? No. It's a streaming device for a decent price that does what it's advertised to do. To expect perfection, Champaign on beer money, would be foolish. I would recommend it to anyone else, but if they aren't particular about the remote, I'd go with the Express.

  I bought this from Amazon to use with my LG OLED TV.  I wanted something that would support all that my LG TV can be.  This stick is amazing.  It's very easy to set up.  The setup is quick.  We like the large menu display (we are in our 60s).  We were watching shows in ten minutes flat!  It helps to register online using your computer first then sync your account with the stick.  It will ask to do that so just follow the directions.  Then it will do an automatic update to the latest firmware.  Adding content is easy from you computer or directly from the TV screen.  It's super easy.Signal strength is very strong for us.  Picture quality is excellent.  Sound quality, also excellent.  No latency or video slowing or stopping.I had to fix one thing during setup because of my ignorance.  The stick recognized 4K at 30fps but I know my LG can do 4K at 60fps.  A quick google showed me I needed to pair the HDMI slot with the HDR LG deep color setting which I did and re-ran setup.  The stick then recognized 4K at 60fps.  Problem solved.By the way there are many, many free channels and live channels along with all the standard premium content offered by Roku.  All easily accessible from Roku's simple menu.  If you are looking to break from cable, this Roku stick will greatly aid in that endeavor.I am very happy with the Roku stick plus.Buy it.  You will be happy too!

  I recently purchased the streaming stick plus and have been blown away by it. The home screen is nice, simple, and easy to customize, while the video playback is snappy and responsive. I've been very happy with it and love the device. My only complaint is that Disney plus requires an HDR tv to play 4k content. My 4K tv is not HDR compatible and as a result Disney plus only plays in 1080p. This is a limitation that Disney has set and my FireTV Stick 4K exhibits the same behavior. Great device and better than my firestick.

  I was in the process of buying a smart tv because the one I have do not have smart functions, low and he hold I thought about buying one of those sticks that's on the market, due to Covid and locked in all I do is watch movies on Prime but in another room and not the comfort of mine. Anyway got this in at an earlier date than originally told and set up was easy and I started enjoying the stick very quickly. yes I would recommend everyone who does not have one and would like wider options than regular tv or if you do not have a smart tv in this case this stick comes in very handy and again setup is easy and the price is great. I would buy from this seller again

  For the money, Roku has the greatest palette of apps - HBOMax, Apple TV and so many more. However, they appear to have equipped this Streaming Stick+ with the cheapest, weakest WiFi receiver possible. We have high-speed Spectrum cable internet, and our router is right in the living room with our TV, about 12 feet away. All our devices (computer, iPad, phones, etc.) show full bars anywhere in that room, and the LG OLED TV itself has no trouble getting a strong signal on any other app - Netflix, Prime Video, etc.Yet the Roku stick, plugged into the HDMI port on the side of the TV, showed a weak connection of only 3 out of 5 bars, and buffered miserably upon watching. Moving the router within 5’ got us up to 4 bars and less connection glitches. Getting up to a strong 5-bar signal required moving our router RIGHT NEXT TO the TV.Unacceptable, period, for a 2021 WiFi-dependent streaming device...so cannot recommend.

  Most older TVs require an HDMI dongle  to connect because the Roku stick is too long. Recently Roku stopped supplying the dongle, and you have to contact them to get one. Eight days later I still do not have it (perpetually listed as ""Shipped"" perhaps because Roku cheaped out and send it via USPS). Unless you have a new TV, just be prepared to stare at the Stick in its box for a week or more before seeing it it even is a good product.Update: after nine days I got the dongle...which was defective (I tested on a second tv which did not need an extension: works without the dongle but not with it) ... back to roku requested a second dongle be expedited. Six days later nothing. If I could give zero stars just for terrible customer service.Update 2: another week and a half and the second extender arrives. It also does not work (tested on a TV and two computers). More time wasted on chat and Roku discussion board, with no useful information provided. I finally solved this buying an HDMI extender on my own (I just picked the first one coming up on an Amazon). Presto it worked. So in total about three weeks of time wasted (plus cost of extender which was supposed to be supplied).

  Why must we have a credit card to signup? Shouldn't it be optional to make it ""easier to buy things later"", THIS FEELS PREDATORY!And SO MUCH PERSONAL DATA is required just to get this thing to bring me to a home screen. ugh.Took my Dad about an hour to get this thing setup... really disappointing, this was supposed to have the easiest setup with minimal overhead, but instead we have to open browsers, make accounts, register credit cards, fill in personal information, tell you about our TV watching habits, etc.  What happened, Roku? You used to be the one consumers could turn to fight against the big companies, now you have become one, and just want to push products and sell our data... sigh

  This is just a device that you need to either link your cable provider or sign up for the channels you want to watch. For instance news and sports, it has abc and NFL channel for free but if you want to watch fox or Newsmax you need to pay. It's capable of streaming Netflix and all the other entertainment platforms but as far as live TV or specific channels you need a subscription. Can't download mobdro or kodi on this device either. I will be returning. I'm not keeping something I have to pay for if I want to watch certain channels.

  I know there was some issues with the remote not working, but mine only seemed to be a battery issue. I put new batteries in and it works as it should. You can also download an app remote that works great for typing in the search as well as being able to plug in head phones and listen privately from my phone. It works great so far and is my third Roku product. The other older two continue to work great. I can’t say about the Alexa integration as I have not attempted to utilize that tool. It sits flush with the HDMI port in my LG tv (it’s not a smart tv) and does not have to be plugged in to an electrical outlet.

  I have had Amazon Firesticks since 2015 but they always were slow or laggy right out of the box. The last Firestick I bought had a horrible remote that would scroll way too fast (probably defective). The Amazon stick couldn't even load it's own Amazon content - I often would end up only using the Netflix or Hulu apps because the Amazon content was so slow to load.I was worried about the Roku being the same way, but the remote is so much better and it's not nearly as bloated as the firestick. I have complete control over the apps I see and download.I had no problems setting it up - works great! I wish I had bought it sooner and that I didn't put up with the firestick frustrations for the past 5 years. Will never look back!The only thing I wish is that I could reprogram the buttons for the 2 buttons / apps I will never use. Also wish I could pair the remote with my soundbar but doesn't seem possible.

  I simply wanted to update my existing Roku box which is now too old to carry certain channels like Hulu. Once installed and connected to my router, the stick said it was updating it's software - only to return to its Let's Get Started page. Frustrating. But the real kicker is that Roku has no dedicated support. They sent me to an utterly worthless third party called JustAnswer which sent me info I had already read and told them didn't work.Looked on their community page - I'm not alone. No solutions (that work) offered. Very frustrating and time wasting. DO NOT BUY.

  I have 2010 Panasonic 42 inch TV in my bedroom.  The TV has a superb 1080p picture and it works great, the only thing wrong with it, it came out right before the whole built in ""Apps"" feature came out to where you could connect all the online video (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon video music streaming, etc...)  Ordered this little unit for a mere $46 and now the TV is just like a brand new smart TV.  This Roku boots up fast, apps open fast, and the remote even operates my TV power and volume.  The remote has a great feel to it, not cheap.  From the time I press the power button on the Roku remote(which powers up the the TV and the Roku) it takes 12 seconds to be on Netflix.  Everything streams in 1080P and is sharper than ever.  Highly recommend.

  Edit Dec. 9 2019. My Roku stick has completely died. It doesn't work AT ALL.I have had issues with this since day 1. Unfortunately I set it up after the 30 day return window. I have had several Roku devices. This is my first no plug necessary type. It's HORRIBLE! I am assuming mine in particular is defective. The remote has a very hard time ""speaking"" to the stick. Pressing buttons and nothing happens. It is beyond frustrating to say the least & only getting worst. I have very strong internet as I work from home, so I assure you that I have the best. Wish I could return this or exchange it. Waste of $50

  I found installing the Roku Stick+, especially the software, extremely complicated. Sometimes you’re using the Roku remote, sometimes you’re using the TV remote, sometimes you’re using the sound bar remote, and then they send you an email, so you have to go to your computer and work from your computer. Also their installation software is a little strange. It really doesn’t work like you think it’ll work. Picture quality is good, and I’m watching property brothers on discovery plus, which I couldn’t get on my new $2000 LG TV.

  Forced to get this to get the Fire DVR to work. Only used it for that purpose as all the other features are already built into my TV.The dongle that plugs into the TV was frustrating as it can not be powered by a USB on the TV (like it’s competitors can), it has to be plugged into a 120v outlet. They provide a short USB cable for this purpose which was nowhere near long enough to reach the power strip. Had to go get a long one and then it finally worked properly.

  I am still disappointed with the quality of the item. I have received two replacement remotes because of defective workmanship. The first remote worked for a year then the it stopped working. The battery compartment was corroded. Amazon replaced with no problem, so customer service is always great. I recently purchased one on black Friday and the remote stopped working after one use. They are mailing another one.

  It seems to work mostly the same as our old fire tv (2014). We don’t care that the remote has no voice control but the stick won’t connect to our echo dots, which is frustrating. I haven’t had a ton of time to problem solve but the first couple things I’ve tried haven’t worked. We are slowly buying more Alexa devices and Alexa controlled devices so it’s a bummer that this Amazon device isn’t connecting easily.

  I really like how easy it was to set up and get connected to my streaming services. And I also like the lightweight remote and voice controls (those are really neat). My only complaint is that I couldn't tell that the middle of the circle pad was a button to start with. It needs to have a marking on it so you know it's the select button lol Other than that it's a great product and super easy to use.

  Works well and is easy to set up.  I have several standard Fire sticks and this is significantly faster booting up and loading apps.  Streaming is flawless and it doesn't drop the network connection.  I don't use the remote to control the TV volume etc so I don't miss that feature.  I do wish Amazon would stop cluttering up the home screen with so many ads but the fire stick itself is great.

  This is my second Fire TV stick. The first one powers all the streaming on our Family Room TV.  It receives search results from our Alexa and does a great job of aggregating results from multiple streaming platforms.I bought this one for a new Dr. J projector I will use in my backyard. I plugged it in and found it was already connected to my WiFi - presumably because it was pre-configured by Amazon based on my Amazon and Alexa account. While that's a tiny bit creepy, it really cut down the setup time. Before I knew it, it was downloading its updates and prepping my services. A few streaming service passwords later we were projecting Hulu, Netflix, Disney and Prime Video.

  The description states its a jailbroke firestick which is a complete lie. Movie channels need subscription and only free apps are ones you can get on your roku tv fir free and if you had subscription already with Disney+, hulu, prime video Starz ect. Jailbrike fire stuck give you access to all cable channels and local channels fir free no subscription needed period!!! My brother has one.

  My other firestick was outdated and was therefore slow and not responding properly.  Decided to go with the Lite version because I don't need the added buttons to turn TV on and off and volume up/down.  So this one works fine for me.  I have had no issues with it thus far and have been using it for about 2 weeks. I also got it while it was on sale and so I feel it was well worth the price.

  I was looking at buying a bigger 4K smart TV to replace a 14 year old plasma TV, but I am very very happy I purchased one of these instead.  I only regret not getting one sooner, but I had been under the false impression FireTV required a Prime membership to make any use of it.  One only needs to have an account with Amazon to enjoy all the available content, except for any Prime Video related content.  This stick also enabled me to replace the laptop computer I had hooked up to that TV.  The wi-fi connector in the stick has no problems getting a signal in the basement.

  Added this new Roku to my account with 3 others, set up took less than 10 minutes, no issues, recognized my “range extender” easily, no buffering, great picture. Running off the tv power without an issue.These replace cable TV for us at this location. Roku can stream Prime video and channels I pay for through them (Acorn, Britbox), and some others are over the air. Only bummer is no live streaming of PBS, through PBS Passport you can watch many shows, through Locast one of the local PBS channels, but not the sub-channel. I pay for a few channels, but if you have a cable account anywhere you can sign in with that account and get some of those pay channels that way. Did not want cable TV with hundreds of stations I didn’t want, this solution has been great.

  I really appreciate the convenience of the streaming stick, and Roku overall. This is my sixth Roku device and third streaming stick. I originally purchased a Roku after I switched from a traditional cable provider to YouTube TV. My Smart TV didn't have the firmware/hardware to support YouTube TV. Instead of buying a new TV, I bought a Roku express.. and then I bought two more. After changing the look of a number of different rooms, I ended up mounting every TV I owned. I ended up switching from the Express to the Streaming stick due to its ability to be hidden behind a TV and draw power from the TV via a USB cable. I'm glad I did. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to remove the amount of clutter, cables and connections. The remote supplied with the streaming stick also has the ability to control your TV's functions (on/off and volume). So again, you won't really need your TV's remote with this device. Overall though, from my experience, I would recommend the Roku brand. Especially if your TV is lacking the software or hardware to support the latest streaming technologies. A Roku will turn any TV with an HDMI port into an up-to-date device.

  When I tried to activate the Roku Firestick on my TV, the attempt failed.  When I contacted the vendor via the phone number given in the instructions, the Amazon Vendor attempted to collect $90.00 to activate the Roku fire stick.  The explanation was that I already had one Roku unit and the new Roku policy would require a one time activation fee of $90.00.  I refused and hung up.  Several minutes later the vendor called and offered to activate the device for $45.00.  Knowing this was a scam, I decided to pay the $45.00 because he offered to help me set up the device for PBS Passport.  I realize that I accepted the scam for expediency.  The device itself works great.  The 1 star is for the total experience.  Amazon should be aware of this type of scam.

  I have a couple of Roku TVs and one Roku box on another TV. This Roku stick is my favorite. It handles the Xfinity software like a champ, much faster than the Roku TV does. Perfect reception a floor away from the wireless router.Very easy to install and takes up no room behind the TV. This is a winner. You don't need to buy the Roku box. This stick does it all.I do not use Alexa so cannot speak to the voice control feature.I will note that the Roku home page will not list an external antenna as an option with the stick. You only seem to get that option on a Roku TV. So if you use an external antenna, you'll have to use your TV's remote to scroll channels. (The Roku remote controls the listings on the Roku home page.)I don't know if it will list cable on the Roku menu if the TV is connected to a cable box because my TV receives cable via Xfinity's software, not a box. That option shows up on the Roku home page as ""Xfinity.""If the TV is also connected to a Blu-ray player, that shows up on the Roku home page as whatever HDMI port it's connected to, e.g., ""HDMI 2."" That's probably the same for other ancillary equipment like game consoles.

  I bought this stick because after I extended my home network, I discovered that my older Roku premier stick was not compatible with the extender a.c. network while streaming Hulu. But now that I have it, I am really appreciating it. The stick is RF so the unit in the HDMI slot does not have to be visible to my remote. There is new functionality as the remote now controls the on/off of my TV and JBL soundbar, as well as the volume (things my Roku Premier never did). In addition, there is a new Wi-Fi booster on the stick that picks up the signal from farther way and enhances it. This means my Hulu Live stream has never looked better. Everything looks better, and sounds great too.  Setup was easy, and I now have two Streaming Stick+ running on both of my TVs, living room and bedroom. I really love the simplicity of the Roku remote and I know that my wife does as well. Totally pleased so far.

  Over the years, we've purchased pretty much every Roku plug-in device on the market, given handfuls of them away as gifts to family and friends, and kept the newest ones for ourselves.  This one is a breeze to use, it popped into our 4K television and worked like a charm, right off the bat.  At first I was a little concerned on two counts - first, the TV we have has its USB ports recessed, so the Roku Streaming Stick had to accommodate a bit of an angle; it took perhaps an extra 30-40 seconds to finesse it in without doing any damage to the Stick or the TV, but it worked.  The second potential issue was the fact that the USB port for this particular television is in the back, and I was afraid that its location would interfere with the remote's operation.  Nope - a breeze.  As with the other models, this streamer seemingly has unlimited channel capacity, so you can grab as many new channels as you need.  The remote also has the headphone jack to allow you to watch television without bothering others in the room.  In all, this was a great purchase.  I cannot say enough great things about the Roku family of streamers.

  So I finally upgraded from my old Roku.  Take into account that I am technically challenged, I was able to set it up in just a few minutes!  I am so happy!  For one, I have an older tv, but the picture is so clear, my tv remote doesn't work so I could use my 4 yr old Roku remote but it doesn't have the volume control on it so I would have to get up and manually change the volume on the tv.  Now it's on my new Roku remote, yay!  I have also noticed that my programs don't buffer like they used to all the time with my older Roku, bonus!

  i red a lot of reviews stating roku wanted $60+ to activate the device. I have 6 roku devices and have paid $0 to activate any of them. DO NOT CALL TO ACTIVATE. If you call in, yes you will be asked to pay to activate. Its simple, go to the website it tells you to fallow the on screen display type in the code and create a account when it asks for credit card imformation to be on file scroll to the bottom and click SKIP. Done, roku activated. On a quality note, this stick has great video output compared to the lower 1080p models worth the money if you want 4k

  The set up was fairly painless and quick. I haven’t tried the voice recognition but the streaming quality was also fine. All in all it’s an awesome product. I was glad to get it at such a low price compared the the regular fire stick because we never use the tv controls any way, so it was perfect for our needs. I’d absolutely recommend the fire stick LITE version to all who don’t use their remote to control the actual tv.

It was working in less than 10 mins.  Now I can watch the shows I like on Pluto, Xumo, Youtube and Tubi that I like to watch in the kitchen when I'm cooking!

  We love the new Stick . Being able to speak for search has made it a winner. We also love Fire so might be prejudice. It is saving me a fortune in cable it is all we use along with broadcast TV. Each of us pay for 1 service so it costs me 20.00 per month for TV.. my kids each pay 10.00 per month. We really do not need all the services but when your not paying 100.00 a month for cable you do not mind 10.00 . All together less than 40.00 a month for premium and TV. Gotta love that

  I bought this because it was on sale. I soon realized that it was on sale for a good reason: it does not have a volume control. Is it crucial to have a volume control to use it? Maybe not. But it makes life a lot easier is it does. Now, every time I use it I have to look for the volume control on the remote that comes with the TV. It just makes it a hassle to use this device. I am not recommending it for this reason.

  I ABSOLUTELY love the firestick; wasted mad years with cable! It's almost like specially designed television just for you and with NO COMMERCIALS or a significant reduction. I can watch Game of Thrones and Miami Vice and wrap it up with The Borgias all AT MY LEISURE! I love it and wish l had this when the pandemic was at it's peak. I DO NOT like Suri, Alexa or any of these voice activated devices and will not utilize it, hence the 4 stars, but if I had a regular one with no voice intergration, it definitely would have received 5 stars. A lot of free programming channels with classics like One Day At A Time, Silver Spoons or the A-Team. Get this and get rid of cable; bill went from $170 monthly to $70, including what l pay for STARZ and Hulu and got HBO max for free when I left cable and went to AT&T

  My old fire remote stopped working suddenly.  So, I took a chance on this new version.  Huge mistake, the interface is terrible, the play button often takes you to the home screen.  Plus the old one goes into a landfill.  I hate making people rich when they're destroying the very planet we need to survive.

  The quality of the streaming, as well as the availability of same (depending on what we'll chose to subscribe to), are all we could've hoped for, especially at the price point. However, the autoplay feature(s) are little short of infuriating. No matter what I've tried, no matter how often I've followed the instructions provided, autoplay just keeps happening.

  My family and I are new to the streaming world as the main source of television watching. We have had cable for over 25 years and as time has progressed the service price kept increasing, but the quality decreased. So, in hearing about the wonderful things of the Fire Stick we decided what better time than Now to try it out. We are so happy that we did and was able to kick the cable bill of $200.00 a month. The Fire Stick World with Alexa voice is saving us money in the long run.

  I've certainly watched FAR more movies with this installed than I had watched when only on my laptop.  I wasn't able to install, but mjy children came to town and installed it for me.  It almost always recognizes my voice (I don't have Alexa).  I doubt I would be able to use it without the voice activation as it seems to require 3  implements to switch between TV & videos/movies.  But I've really enjoyed having it.

The Firestick allows you to have all your streaming services in one place and ready to use whenever you feel like it. You can even play around with it and sideload some cool apps. Overall, a great experience so far.

  I have the only Samsung TV that does not have internet or Bluetooth capabilities.  When I first purchased the TV it had YouTube and Amazon Prime apps and for some unknown reason Samsung removed them.Because I really like the picture my Samsung produces I purchased the Fire Stick and love it.  I get YouTube and Bluetooth, and I can download other apps.  The picture is great.

  Just new, so haven't had much time to try everything out.  Still learning the ins and outs of the remote.  Wish it had an ON/OFF switch, throws me every time to turn it off.  Have not figured out what channels I have that are free vs pay.  Thought there would be more free channels/TV shows to be able to watch.  Will keep working on getting to know the system.  Don't use voice or Alexa.

  Skip the Lite & spend extra for the TV control version. I've owned 4 Firesticks & this was the only one I ever had major issues with. It's also the only ""Lite"" version I've purchased, or ever will again. It's obvious they've changed the firmware from the older versions, the menu is terribly laid out and hard to navigate, downloader functions are severely restricted and you must download an app that needs to  be given permissions before you can even change certain settings. I use my other 3 Firesticks to stream with ILML through SOPlayer & the files would not install. I don't use ""Alexa"" so I can't comment on that functionality. Ultimately, what I thought was a $20 bargain turned into the biggest headache I've had with a streaming device. Definitely NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!

  Great deal for black friday ! this firestick is light but powerful. It loads fast, set up was super easy and I have had no issues so far. I have owned 3-4 firesticks in the past and each one has caused me issues very quickly. But this one is a great updated version and like I said its fast. I can use the voice controls and Alexa, but I don't use Alexa often, don't really care for that feature. Also this firestick does not have TV controls, so that can be annoying at times having to switch remotes to turn up the volume or turn the tv on in general. Not a big deal at all. For the price, I think I got it for 17 bucks and i used a gift card so really this was free for me! I didn't need a new firestick but for the price I said why not. This firestick works excellent and I am extremely pleased with this purchase!

  Not sure what they did to this fire stick but this is my 4th one and this one is by far the slowest thing I have... it constantly disconnect to wifi. Never works right with my echo show. Also when will you be allowed to watch spectrum TV on the Fire Stick. Thank God the Fire Stick allow you to mirror so I can watch cable TV. Other then that I do like the Fire Stick.not a fan of the new home screen either

  Wh have an older flat screen in the dining room which is not a 'smart TV'.  This allows us to stream all the channels and content from our Samsung 55"" in the TV room over our home network.  For the price, it's a real bargain and saved us from having to purchase a new 32"" smart TV.  Easy to install, worked right out of the box and I was watching the History channel within 15b minutes.

  Is anyone else having issues with the sound? It doesn’t seem to be sending a sound signal all the time. Some days it works, some days it doesn’t. Amazon sent me to an Indian call center to try to troubleshoot with no avail. They also won’t return it because the call center said without knowing the issue, they can’t say it’s broken.

  Setting up the fire stick is fairly easy. Also it is easy to associate your different accounts with the fire stick. The only glitch that I have come across is one time the volume did not work and the other time the screen options were not showing up at all on the television. The fixed to these two problems was to unplug the fire stick from the power and then replug it in after 10 seconds to allowThe memory to clear itself. Otherwise I am very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone wishing to move away from the high cost of cable television.

  Recently i purchased a projector in Amazon its not smart and i was kind of sad not able to view my favorite content using my projector.I found a deal for $17 and extra $5 off for some prime credit. So i got the Stick for effectively$12 such a low price. Now i am able to make my projector smart by connecting fire tv stick.After using for few days i realized google just launched google tv app and claimed we can watch all the content at one place. Amazon is doing the same thing for years with fire stick

  My daughter bought this for my birthday.  She helped me to set it up and get it working.  I like the content it has.  I'm still learning how to use everything on it.  The only problem I have is signal.  My WiFi in my house can be weak.  I wish Amazon still included the Ethernet port on the device.  But I see they separated it so they could price gouge you to buy the Ethernet adapter if you need a wired connection.

  Update: Amazon reached out but I missed the call. My son suggested restarting the firestick which seems to have fixed the problem.  I should have thought about that.  It works OK.  Original: Plugged in, looked like other fire sticks.  Will open your aps like hulu, cbs and netflix but will not load and will not play. Old firestick went kaput after 5 or so yrs, thought this one would do but it will not open anything inside the cbs, hulu or netflix aps, just sits there spinning.

  Firestick user interface is clumsy and does not have the Spectrum app.  I am a Spectrum customer and prefer to have access to my Spectrum channels.  Plus, the Firestick just would not work.  Got the circle thinker repeatedly and no show would come on.  Lots of buffering.  I bought 4 and returned all 4.  Bought Roku instead.

  The fire TV device, has no controls on the device itself - so you're totally dependent on a remote that1. Eats batteries for breakfast2. Stops controlling the fire Tv device for no reason and has to be ""re-paired""3. Has no lights to indicate whether the batteries are good or that the device is working and speaking to the fire TV device4. Is not guaranteed to pair with the device even when both are working

  I had an earlier model that was a few years old. It had become slow slow and difficult to use. I resisted buying a new stick. I was concerned it would not be compatible with our older TV. I didn't want to get forced into buying a new TV (I have an 8 year old Vizio). I'm so glad I bought it! The new model works great. It's compatible with the TV. It's fast and easy to use. It functions the same as the earlier model.

  Because of CoVid we find ourselves watching more TV.  It was fairly easy to hook up the firestik, though we found on our TV one of the HMDI connections wasn't working.  Luckily it worked in another plugin.  It is now working great and we don't need the Echo Dot or Alexa to use it.  It looks like more and more channels are going to subscription services though.  Oh, and having Amazon Prime is a good thing.

  Love it so far simple, easy to set up, wish you came a little travel accessory bag so we travel we can throw the cables, the remote and the device into a small pouch or bag.  Someone gave us an older 40 inch LED screen that was not smart capable… But with the fire stick we can Watch all our streaming shows in a second room so there’s no argument between the kids over who can watch the streaming show and when... and not be relegated to an iPad...

  We bought both the Fire TV Stick and this Roku Streaming Stick Plus for two different tvs.  The Roku has a nice clean home page, but we couldn't get any further than that because we could not get any audio from our sound bar when using the Roku. And apparently the remote will not work to control the volume with a soundbar (which we didn't know before we ordered it), even IF we could have had audio.  It worked with our tv audio, but it does not have the sound quality we liked.  So then we tried it on our 2nd tv which uses just the tv audio.  It played audio, but through the remote setup, we discovered that the remote was not compatible to control Roku audio.  This may be a great option for some if you have the right audio setup, but it didn't work for us.  We'll be getting another firestick instead.

  I bought this to watch tv in the bedroom and not have to use a cable box anymore (so tired of the fee monthly for that). I have a Firestick and an older version chromecast on other televisions.  The chromecast can be annoying since it has to be controlled with an app on my phone (or tablet) so it's not a direct comparison to this. But I like the Roku better than the Firestick- I don't have to go through multiple layers of Amazon suggestions to get to the ""stations"" I want. I use the Bravo and HGTVgo apps and watch live tv without a hitch. One annoying this is that i do need to periodically sync with my cable provider before watching the live streams.

  Bought this to replace the previous stick which went belly up, and since I have bought at least 10 iterations of the streaming device from stick to 4khd, this recent device came with a new issue.  Apparently, Roku and Spectrum are having a disagreement over fees, which means that the recent devices are shipping without the TimeWarner/Spectrum app. For a Spectrum customer, this means you have to lease/purchase additional cable boxes to watch their programs, and you may not be able to register your Roku apps to the cable provider services that you pay for.  My only other gripe is the device stops working if an update is pending, and/or wipes settings after an update.Take care of the older devices that still have the Spectrum app, but be forewarned that if they are not being updated, they will eventually fail.

  I ordered a Roku Stick+ for my TV and I kept my Satellite TV (Direct TV) for 1 more month, thinking I might not like the Roku and in case I didn't have the channels that I am used to watching. I have found that I never switch back over to the Satellite to watch TV. I plan on dropping Direct TV, after this month's bill is up. I also ordered a Roku Stick for my kids.If you are looking for a way to cut the Satellite/Cable bill, this is a great option. Saving me hundreds of dollars. A one time payment of $50 for the Stick+ and no monthly cable bill.  We have a subscription to Netflix ($9.99/mo) and Hulu ($4.99/mo special and bundled with Spotify and Showtime). So for $14.98/mo I can get all the shows and movies that I want. Great Deal. Was paying $170/mo for Direct TV and that didn't even include any Movie channels.

  Just received my Roku streaming Stick plus. It would not activate with a code I was sent to a toll-free number to have it activated. Was then told by the service tech that I had to pay $99 for a lifetime subscription nowhere in the purchasing of this item does it say anything of the subscription. Tell them I had no intention of paying $100 for an item I have owned before and never had to pay a subscription fee. Needless to say we are severely disappointed and Roku customer service told this to this promptly return the device so that's exactly what we're doing.

  The Roku service itself is great. Excellent interface, apps, etc. The problem is that you can’t actually experience it because the remote that comes with the newer Roku Streaming Stick+ has a defect that causes it to drain brand new batteries in as little as a few days. It’s a well-known issue (look at the hundreds of posts in their support forums) and will require you to invest in rechargeable batteries that you’ll have to put in every time you use the cursed thing.Save yourself the money, hassle, and frustration and buy another roku device - or just go with another vendor.

  This is our 3rd Roku.  I'm back on Amazon to buy a fourth, another one like this.  It's so much easier to search with the voice function.  Our 1st Roku won't update anymore, so I think our experience will be seamless with them all working the same way on each TV.  On New Year's Eve we returned our cable box and are saving over $125 a month. So far we seems to have a better selection of shows WE want to watch with the Roku Channels and our Fire Stick.  We haven't had any problems with the remote recognizing the stick, which is in an HDMI port in the back of the TV.  The only time we lost our signal was the power plug falling out of the Roku.  That was from the repeated moving of the TV to hook up a new antennae. My fault!  Very happy the transition has been so easy.

  So I have an apple TV and amazon fire stick. But this roku streaming + stick is better than both. The navigation interface is a lot more intuitive than the amazon fire stick but maybe not as elegant as the apple tv.PROS- Easy to set up- Tons of free streaming content- Remote controls TV- Strong Connection- Bluetooth headset connection so no need for wired headsets. Use the bluetooth headsets you have.- Can cast your ios photos, videos, and music to your tv.Cons- The remote keeps randomly losing connection. I have to remove the batteries and put it back in to get it to reconnect.- The voice search doesn't work in different apps. So you can't be in Youtube or hulu and use voice search to search for content. It has to be used in the main Roku menu.- There is no mute button. This shouldn't be an extra feature you need to pay for.- The bluetooth headset connection can be spotty and it doesn't connect directly to the roku stick. Instead it's connecting to the app on your smartphone. So I don't know if that's the issue.- Can't mirror your ios device on the screen like an apple tv.Despite these cons, I still plan to purchase others. But I need a resolution to the remote control issue before I do that. It's not a deal breaker but it is annoying.

  These are my first Rokus, bought two at once, and overall, I’m pleased with the outcome, but there is a problem with the remotes eating up the battery charge.Installation: 2 large TVs up close against the wall.  Power outlets right behind, no wires hanging down.  For both TVs, just not enough room back there to connect the stick directly to the power outlets, therefore had to connect the power to the TV’s USB port.  As noted in other reviews, not optimal but I really don’t notice it.  The Roku Stick goes to an HDMI port, and for the older of my TVs, this port is at the back middle of the TV, not off more to the side.  When plugging the Roku stick into this HDMI port, it is sticking out perpendicular to the wall, and sticking out too far for the TV to be put back close to the wall.  (The Roku stick is a few inches long.)  Problem solved with UGREEN HDMI Extension Cable 4K HDMI Extender Male to Female Compatible for . . . Roku TV Stick, 1.5 ft., at Amazon of course.  So, the Roku Stick hangs from an extension behind the TV, not a problem.Setup and activation: Entered a couple of items, went so fast and smooth I can’t remember much about it anymore.  Wireless reception excellent but I wasn’t expecting problems here.  Watching mostly the local PBS station’s “Passport”, Netflix, Amazon Prime.Remote: Reason for only 3 out of 5 stars. It’s easy to use and controls the TV power and volume without a second remote needed.  However, as also mentioned in a previous review, there’s an issue with the remotes eating up the charge of the batteries.  After only about 5 weeks, the first remote needed a battery change.  The second remote needed a battery change after 7 weeks, and these were Duracell batteries.

  These are replacing my mom's DirecTV service. Super easy to install, only the power cord to the TV shows, no other nasty wires. No dust magnet genie or satellite boxes. Setting up the channels you want to add is amazingly easy & can set up control to curb inadvertent movie purchases.The only negative I can find is Roku uses a LOT of bandwidth. I have xfinity plan with 1Tb of data and that is used up by the 20th of the month - mom is elderly & watches a LOT of TV. Had to upgrade internet to unlimited data, but even so it is still less expensive than the DirecTV plan.So weigh your options, do research. All I can say is I'm very pleased (and I pay for it).

  I had purchased this same item about a year ago and had issues with the reliability of the remote.  But, after reading they had upgraded the firmware AND rethinking my whole setup around my TV, I decided to give it another go.  I have to say that I think part of the whole reliability issue was my setup.  It simply did not dawn on me how many other WiFi devices were so close to the TV, many of which I never use.  I had 1) an old Wi player still on, 2) a WiFi enabled DVD player still on, 3) a WiFi enabled amp, 4) a WiFi enabled cable set top box, and 5) the stick.  That's enough to drive any device insane.  So, after deciding to either disable or remove what wasn't being used, the stick worked flawlessly.  I honestly have not had one little flicker of trouble.  Sorry to Roku for all the flak I gave them in the past.  Probably mostly my fault.  So, 5 stars this time !

  Turned it on the other day and went to an app to stream a show, 5 min. into the show , WARNING DEVICE OVERHEATING . It was hot to the touch after 5 min. That is ridiculous. So here was my setup. I had a three way splitter with a BluRay DVD player in one slot, a Firestick in the next, and Roku SS+ plugged directly into the splitter. After the overheat , I connected the roku to a different HDMI slot with a 3 foot cable and moved it a few feet away from the other devices. I watched for 2 hours and had no issues, although the stick was still quite warm, that might be normal. I give it 2 stars because it is a wealth of entertainment choices, if only it did not overheat! Thousands of people complain about this and the answer is always plug Roku into an HDMI cable and not into the HDMI port on your TV. Hope this helps.

  I plugged it into a year old 58"" 4K Samsung T.V., and it plugged into a recess in the back cover, parallel to the screen, versus sticking out in back, and I initially had problems with the Remote.  It just didn't see it, until I went up to the T.V. and held the remote around the right side edge of the screen, then it was able to make inputs.  I found a block in the Manual that indicated if it didn't fit well, they would send an ""Extension Cable"" for the stick, which I immediately ordered.  Until it arrived about 5 days later, the Remote worked about 50% of the time, and the others I had to go and hold it around the edge.  Since the extension cable arrived, and I installed it between the Stick and the T.V., it works fine.  So if you get one, I suggest you order the ""Free Extension Cable"" too.  The streaming is fine.

  For nearly 10 years, we've used the full Roku unit, never a stick version. However, because portability is something I was looking for, getting the stick seemed to be preferred choice to be able to use it on different TV's or carry it for travel. Without a discount or sale, I find Roku pricey compared to its competitors.In any case, setting up the Roku stick was about as tedious as a full console unit. I find it tedious because there is no keyboard to enter characters upon set up.  But once you get past that, the Roku stick is pretty awesome. You can use an app to control the stick also.Unlike the Amazon stick which has a chintzy weak-feel remote, the Roku stick has a great feel and solid remote. Compared to Amazon stick, I definitely prefer the Roku stick.

  To be fair, I ordered this Roku for the guest bedroom. But then I thought, gee, it'd be kinda nice to only have to use one remote. So I removed the one in the living room and installed this new streaming stick. Alas, got through the installation, only to find that the ""Roku enhanced remote is designed to control volume and power for your TV. It cannot directly control other devices connected to your TV, such as an audio/video receiver (AVR) or soundbar."" Well, now you tell me! Apparently you may be able to have Roku send volume to your TV that can send it to the soundbar, but my older TV/Bose won't support that.So the good news is that my guests will get the streaming stick with one remote for the TV in the guest bedroom. And I'll continue to use two remotes in my living room. Or maybe I'll look up some new enhanced remote that will do all three.

  Really nice looking and small piece of technology. Transformed my TV into a Smart TV like it was nothing. BUT before it was able to work properly, I had to investigate why the Roku stick wasn't working after downloading it's first update, it rebooted then downloaded the update, again and again. After about an hour looking for solutions I fixed it by connecting it to a mobile wifi network (my laptop's). After that I connected it to our regular home wifi and now it works like a charm. It didn't replace the tv remote tho, even thought the brand was in their list and I bought this TV about two months ago so it is a new model

  I have Comcast Xfinity and the cost just got to be prohibitive so something had to be done to lower my monthly bill. I'd love to cut the cord but...I ordered this for my bedroom and so far it works great and saves me 10 bucks a month. Setup was easy, signal is good with no issue's thus far. The Xfinity app works well but the Roku remote has no number keys on it so changing channels is a bit more difficult. I have started storing all my usual channels in Favorites so that makes it easier to get to the channel I want. One issue is the ""stick"" has a little light on it so at night I see the glow from behind my TV, just letting you know in case you need complete darkness at night while sleeping. Everything else like Netflix and Amazon work great.I'll update if any issue's occur but so far so good. It will pay for itself in 5 months.Quick update on the light, it does go off after the Roku being off for a extended period so the light issue is not a problem as long as you don't want to crash right after shutting the tv off which I unfortunately usually do...

  I bought this specifically for my mom to watch streaming kdrama on the Viki app with japanese subtitles. Setup is very simple and i was able to download the Viki app.  Its a very good streaming media player (quick, good video quality and simple navugation) however unlike Tivo 4k stream, you cant select a language or language subtitles within each app.  You have to go to Roku’s system settings to select the language.  The problem is that they only support English, German, Spanish, French and Portuguese.  No asian languages. They support more subtitles in addition to the above languages they support Russian, Turkish, Polish, Ukrainian, Romanian, Dutch, Croatian, Hungarian, Greek, Czech and Sweedish.  Again no asian languages.  For the price, this is a good streamer if the support your language.

  ALERT! If you intend to power your stick with the included USB extension power connector (recommended), do yourself a favor and buy a USB EXTENSION cable (I recommend 10ft), NOT POWER cable, along with your Streaming Stick+. I use it on a 55in oled and Roku’s included extension isn’t sufficient. If you read the fine print on Amazon’s list of power cables, they are NOT COMPATIBLE with the Streaming Stick+. That said, this little remote is still so satisfyingly sturdy, dependable and functional it brings a smile. For streaming I much prefer the Stick+ over my TV’s bells & whistles remote. Connecting the Roku was a breeze and it integrates as if it is native to the TV. I don’t use voice commands so I can’t comment on alexa integration but streaming quality and app availability (the reason I bought it) is superb.

  Have been a long time Roku user, however, when they improved the speed of the devices they no longer work with slower Wifi. Tried the Stick, Express and Premier, non of them would give clear picture on sports channels. (worked well on all other channels) After talking with Roku Support, they walked me thru the troubleshooting process and determined I needed to increase my router speed, however, that isn't available in my area. I will add that I still have and use a Roku stick that is several years old. It's much slower but does not have a problem with the slower internet speeds. Both Amazon and Roku were very helpful trying to resolve the issue, however, it just doesn't work with slower internet speeds. Recently purchased the Amazon TV Fire stick and it works perfectly adapting to the slower speed.

  I bought a $50 Streaming Stick+, and was excited to connect and begin using it. The Stick turned out to be too long to connect to our TV without an HDMI extender (a little device to connect the Stick in these situations). Roku doesn't include an extender in the package, but promises to send a free one to customers who need it (it probably costs  Roku about $1 plus shipping). I went to Roku's website to request one, and got this message: ""Your request for an HDMI Extender has been placed on backorder and is expected to ship 2114 -12-31"" - i.e., in 94 years. I wrote customer support and received this message back: ""Unfortunately, the HDMI extender is out of stock for now. We do not have enough resources to look into the information to ship the HDMI extender. ... Your request has been marked as resolved. ... Have a great day!"" Roku could have included the HDMI adapter in its package since many customers obviously need. It could have charged a dollar or two more for that. Instead, it's made me, and I'm sure many other customers, spend hours trying to get the device, only to be told to wait 94 years -- and so permanently alienated customers, and provoked this review. And BTW - once you solve the connection problem, try ""activating"" the Stick - that was a 2- hour process with Roku that repeatedly failed.

  We've been a Roku user since 2006 and our previous Roku 3 was giving us an issue where we would be watching a show on Amazon Prime and the show would disappear and it would then go to the Roku menu and we would see our saved channels disappear one by one. We thought it may be due to the old Roku 3 so we bought this Roku 4K Stick and the same thing started to happen. We thought our Roku account got hacked so we changed our password and still the same problem. So we contacted Roku and they suggested to delete our account and create a new account. That solved our problem! We decided to keep this 4K Stick since we have a 4K tv, was inexpensive and is more portable for travelling. It has been working great ever since. Love the voice command and the cleaner look of the 4K Stick vs the Roku 3 device you need to plug in with power. Also the Roku 3 gets rather warm when plugged in all the time.

  I've had Roku boxes from the beginning, but this is the first stick I bought. I was leery on getting the stick because I thought performance would suffer, but nothing is far from the truth. I purchased the Roku stick + because of great youtube reviews. I have the Roku Premium plus box in my family room and truthfully this stick performs just as good or better. Very quick response and love the fact that the remote now can be programmed to turn on and off my TV plus can also control the TV volume. I don't have a cable box in the bedroom so with different apps on Roku, I can watch LIVE channels 4,5,7, History channel, Travel channel and many more as long as I have my Optimum cable on my other sets. With the new Roku remote, now all I need is that remote and I can control my TV and Roku just like a cable box. Amazon was having a deal on the Roku during the holidays and if you use a Prime credit card you were also getting an additional 20% rewards bonus.  VERY VERY happy with the Roku stick +. Make sure you get the  '+""  and not the older regular Roku stick

  There is a 32-year-old TV in the basement of my house that works great, so I didn't want to send it to recycling. I didn't want to get rid of it just because it's old, but I wanted to be able to stream programming when I'm crafting or exercising because over-the-air channels weren't really what I wanted to watch. I bought an HDMI-to-RCA adapter and this Roku Streaming Stick+ and voilà! My ancient TV is a smart TV. The Roku was super-easy to connect and set up--much easier than I imagined it would be, given the circumstances. I was immediately able to connect and log into my streaming services such as Hulu, Netflix, Prime, Peacock, etc. Today I figured out how to connect the Roku to Sirius XM and Alexa. So far, I'm thrilled with this purchase.

  First all I love the Roku streamers.  I have an Roku Ultra downstairs in our dedicated Home Theater.  It works flawlessly.  The remote works with the Roku being out of site.  This Roku Stick is used on our upstairs TV.  And it the remote is always losing connection with the stick.  I’ll get up and use it close to the stick and then it activates.  But when it’s idle for awhile, again it loses the interface.  It’s a disappointment and I’m going to replace it with another Roku Ultra.  One question for Roku-When are you going to be able to stream Dolby Atmos through other streaming services like Netflix?

  UPDATE 3/17/20:Product began overheating intermittently while in use, after a couple of weeks. Seems to work good otherwise.Strong WiFi signal to unit, & not in an enclosed area (cabinet) either. Ordered the ""free extender"", but it's back ordered until 4/20. Can't get a live agent on the phone to address the issue. Wondering if this is a model, or individual device issue.Considering the initial product cost, plus the surprise registration fee (total $100.00 +/-), not a happy camper - at this point.--------------------------------------Nice product, but in order to activate, I got stuck by ROKU - for a $57.00 ""one time"" registration fee. Well OK, after expressing my EXTREME displeasure to the friendly ROKU customer service rep, I received a $10.00 (WOW!) discount.My whole point was, that at the time of purchase, I saw no mention of a $57.00 ""one time"" registration fee. Either here on Amazon, or on the ROKU web site. If it was there, I somehow missed it. Should have been posted right up front - bold letters, & in plain English.Would I have purchased anyway? Maybe. That, or opted for the Amazon version. Really dislike ""GOTCHA'"" surprises...

  The interface is fast, switching between apps is quick and easy. The remote could use a jump forward button like the jump back button. It jumps back 15-20 seconds which is handy. There are 4 preprogrammed shortcut buttons to instantly open those 4 apps. It would have been more handy to be able to reprogram them for app shortcuts I actually use. I don't use sling or Hulu so those buttons are useless. I'm also not a fan of volume buttons on the side of the remote that are easy to accidently press just holding the remote. The streaming quality so far has been surprisingly top notch. From HD to 4k, the picture is consistently beautiful. Even the high definition audio is passed through instead of being downconverted to regular Dolby digital, when available. I think physical blu ray and 4k discs still offer better uncompressed audio and video resolution, but this streaming stick+ performs better than I expected. And since I ditched expensive satellite, I'm glad to have more money in my pocket every month.

  This was a really super easy system to set up on an older TV with HDMI and powered through a USB port on the TV. It only took 20 minutes, most of that time was spent filling out the Roku online form to set up the account. You will need a credit card or debit card as they want a payment in place, it's something you can't skip. Otherwise everything worked great, super easy to use, did exactly what we needed it to do.We did not set up for alexa, so left that blank on the review.

  This is an inexpensive answer to stream all of your apps. We have 2 different smart TVs - Samsung and Vizio - and they each have different apps available. The Vizeo didn’t allow us to download newer apps (Discovery+ and HBOmax) but with the fire stick you can set up all of your apps and easily stream them. My husband likes the voice feature of the remote. I cannot review the Alexa integration as we don’t use Alexa but our friends have the same fire stick and Alexa seems to run their entire home and they are very happy with it. We highly recommend it. Easy solution to stream everything you like!

  I like this product although I wish I would’ve picked the one with the volume control because I still find myself changing remotes to moved the volume. My fire stick would not fit into the back of my TV so I had to use the little extension cord that comes with it other than that it seems to work for just fine. This unit will work just fine if you’re not an Amazon prime reader however I recommend using this with prime if you already have it or want to get it

  I don't have Alexa so don't use the feature. My device came with some other apps downloaded and I also added a  few more. There are a few i still need to add but have to find a way to do it fom sources other than amazon as they don;t have the app i want.  The device i have is great, is HD and looks excellent.  I do have a occasional problem with sound loss.  To correct this you need to unplug the device from power source for maybe 10 seconds then plug it back in and the sound comes back. It's  an issue in the PC board you can't fix. I had this hapen with TV's in a hotel I worked at quite often.  In general I am satisfied with my puchase.

  I actually downgraded from a old regular Fire Stick to a new Fire Stick Lite because it has Alexa remote. However, this seem like an upgrade to me because my old Fire Stick was from the first generation. Great quality picture, easy to navigate, no problems whatsoever (so far!). My old Fire Stick wasn't able to view new apps like Disney+ but this has no problem. Glad I upgraded!

  Love the new fire TV stick. Works way better than my 1st generation as expected.  My only complaint is the round back on the remote. The remote wiggles around catching light and is a distraction.  Why it doesn't have a flat back like all remotes is beyond my brain.  I submitted a complaint direct to amazon on this and I hope you will too.  Remotes should have a flat on the back to keep them stable.

  The price is great and I like the remote. The user interface itself is too cluttered and clunky. I would prefer to have my last used apps at the top then scroll down when I was interested in seeing what was available in Prime. It seems to be a trend with this kind of interface and is very similar to Microsoft’s XBox interface only not quite as bad. The Firestick is a great product, but the UI leaves lots to be desired.

  My TV was having issues with Netflix, like it would just stop playing after like 45 min, so we just got the firestick lite for a special price. It works great, it's plug and play and whatever you wanna play, just ask Alexa and she'll find it for you, even if you don't have a service where something is streamed you can suscribe from the firestick UI. Great way to give an older smart TV model a few more years of use

  Update: went front two stars to one due to bad customer service. They called to “see how they can help”, then asked me to emailed them since I wasn’t able to pickup the call. I emailed them and never heard back. Disappointing!I had bought the older fire stick a couple of years back and was very happy with it. But I can’t say the same about this one. I’ve had this one for a couple of weeks now and it freezes quite often. I had several times where sound would somehow stop and I would have to unplug or reset the fire stick for it to work again. Not a fan of this one.

  This is a big upgrade from my 2018 model. Apps load faster and no lag. I have fast internet (75mbs) and my older version at times seemed slow to load apps and shows/movies. This solved that issue. This is the model w/o volume control as I prefer my TV remote for that.Also I noticed an improvement in picture quality. This definitely delivers and I'm glad I upgraded my old Fire stick.

  I signed up for PBS Passport and needed a device to have access to the APP.  The Fire-stick lite was highly recommended. And so far I am totally pleased. Any problems I have encountered are from my limited knowledge of “streaming.”  I have not yet ventured into voice recognition/Alexa.  Hence I have not rated either feature and have given only a 4 star rating overall. I do not want to rate something that I have not used. I am sure that when I do venture into these features, my overall rating will be a 5 star

  We bought this because my DVD player no longer could stream Amazon and we have lots of movies on Prime Instant Video.  I compared this to the Firestick.  I initially was going with the Firestick.  What changed my mind was the fact that Roku was updated for Disney+ and Apple TV. Which I also have subscriptions for. They have the buttons for these right on the remote as well as Amazon and Netflix.  I did not see that with the Firestick.  The Roku was very easy to install and even came with a smaller cable where you can connect the Roku to using the USB port so that you don’t have to plug it into the wall.  Other devices have that sold separately and can run an additional 10$.  The remote paired easily with my TV remote.  So you can use the Roku remote to turn your TV and manage the volume/mute.  The only thing you will need your TV for is to change the Input. We also got the Roku because we are thinking about cutting our cable and this remote is compatible with many TV streaming devices.

  I mostly use Plex on my Roku devices, with some Amazon Video / Netflix / Hulu in the mix. This Streaming Stick is, like all Roku products I've tried, easy to set up, fast, responsive and works brilliantly with the above-mentioned services.I just wish the #&*@! branded shortcut buttons on the remote could be reprogrammed or at least disabled! Few things are more frustrating than accidentally pressing one of them and being abruptly kicked out of whatever I'm watching and dumped into a different service.

  Looking for a cord cutting service that's like my cable service.  Just want a ""live tv guide"" with movies integrated for free.  With the choice of my paying for newer movies . not older movies.People always say you can watch movies / tv.  But they don't say that movies/ tv shows are limited , Basic and old. You have to pay for 99c to 3.00 plus to watch a movie or episode.It's actually just a thumb drive with downloaded files consisting of applications similar to ( hulu-netflix- crackle) offering ""basic movies and TV"" shows older than what's on your actual cable to paying for intermediate to more recent content. I'm disappointed.Ex. Men in black (1) can watch on cableFree.  With Roku-firestick. Etc. They request 99 to 2.99 to just watch.  Rent at a higher price.I think ""kodi"" is the best device. Not always stable but stable enough. You can see everything movies just leaving theater, all seasons TV shows and don't have to pay.  You just have to be a little tech savvy to do the same things in Roku and fire sticks downloading the  apps like hulu, crackle, to get their movies /TV shows, News networks to see their content.But with Kodi all contents is free.  The sites databases ""mdb"" the content come from can choose. But you just go to another.With these sticks- they are usually always working because you pay to watch that 1 episode TV show or movie and they will keep it stable for you.With Kodi the developers work to build this app to keep mdb open /stable for you to watch content free. I'm still looking at it Roku. But I may be going back to Kodi.

  I bought a Roku for my mother a couple of months ago. She was looking to cut her cable but didn't know any alternatives to traditional cable. I did some research, and I saw that for people like my mother, who were used to conventional television and had no clue how to use streaming devices, Roku has the best user interface. The application buttons on the remote mean 9 times out of 10, my mother doesn't even have to navigate the menu! She just clicks a button, and she is in the app!Now fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. I decided I wanted a Roku for my bedroom television. I picked this up and wouldn't you know that my TV is a 4k television and I had no clue! I bought the thing like three years ago, and I used it primarily to play my switch on there. So I am now using my TV to its full potential. The remote has those same helpful buttons and the addition of the voice remote AND Alexa integration. So for those days when I am feeling extra lazy and don't care about looking for the remote, I can yell at my TV.All in all, for me, it has been a pleasant experience. I would recommend Roku to anyone who is looking to stream in one place on their television.

  I had ordered a basic Roku streaming stick a couple of years ago.  That one was enjoyable but we experienced quite a few slowdowns during our viewing of some movies and tv shows.  Recently after reading reviews about the latest 4K Roku streaming stick, I decided to purchase one for our main viewing tv and connect the original to one of our bedroom tv's.  Very pleasantly surprised by the viewing quality and the speed of our streaming movies with the 4K Roku.  Extremely satisfied with its outstanding performance and have watched quite a few movie series on Netflix and Prime streaming.  Roku streaming stick has replaced many of the tv shows which we have normally viewed in the past and has become our go-to viewing media.  Cannot say enough good things about Roku 4K except that it is Awesome and has more than exceeded our expectations.  And I certainly have enjoyed some of the old Westerns that I watched as a child on your Roku Channel Old Time Westerns.  Who needs cable tv when you can hook up with Roku.

  My mom is more tech savvy than people half her age (80!)  What she can't figure out for herself she knows to come to me for help.  Years ago I bought her a Roku 3 so she could easily watch Netflix in her Living Room.  She asked about getting one for on for her bedroom TV.  I got the Stick+ because there was no ethernet connection in there and I'm not big on depending on Wifi to work consistently.  I hooked it up and it wouldn't plug into the back of her TV because of the HDMI jack placement.  I checked and Roku will send you a short HDMI extension cable for FREE!  Got the cable 3 days later and it all setup great with a very strong Wifi signal.  She recently cut the cable and went all internet and uses the Rokus for her Streaming TV service (she likes Philo the best for price and channels she wants).  I used the enclosed power supply as her TV's USB port doesn't put out enough juice.  So all is good.

  Recently decided to cut the cable cord and go with Roku + YouTube TV. So far things are fantastic for my use. The Roku is easy to install and set up. Platform agnostic with a very nice and snappy menu user interface.There is room for improvement with the remote control + YouTube TV guide controls, I would like to be able to do more voice commands like ""Watch CNN on YouTube TV"" etc. You can't do that yet. Also a little confusing if you hit the wrong button on the remote it might take you out of the YouTube TV app and back to the main menu. Once you figure out what does what, it's pretty straightforward. Hopefully they work on making it even better and intuitive. These services are still pretty new, so things are still being developed and getting dialed in. Otherwise it works very well and I'm saving on my monthly bill while still getting all the channels and services I need.I wish the remote control was rubberized, it's hard plastic and kind of small and slippery. Also wish the buttons were backlit so I can see what I'm doing in the dark at night.

  It was difficult to plug the stick into my Samsung TV, but Roku sent (for free) an HDMI extension cord, so that problem was solved.  (Instructions for ordering the extension were in the box.)  I bought a second Roku remote from a physical Walmart store and now my wife and I each have a controller.  We watch YouTubeTV, Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu with the Roku.  After a month or more of confirming that we could live without cable TV, we cancelled it.  Now we're only paying the cable company for internet service.YouTubeTV is our replacement for regular cable, and while the cable company overall offered more features (like the ability to get a synopsis for what is currently playing), YouTubeTV's unlimited cloud recording capability at least partially makes up for whatever other shortcomings it has.I like the ability to unplug the Roku stick and take it with me.  As long as there's Wi-Fi internet, I have access to all of my shows.  I certainly couldn't do that with cable.

  Back story of why I purchased it. The Sony TV in the living room is a smart tv that is getting old. The smart functions take a long time to load and the tv is not very responsive when trying to scan on Netflix or Hulu. I have an Amazon Firestick which works very well but is very cluttered with Amazon services and adds. My girlfriend wanted something easier to find the apps she wanted and something easier for her 7 year old to use. So I did some research and ended up buying this. Setup is easy and the UI is clean. After some tweaking to the UI I have the most used apps at the beginning and the least used apps at the end. I also was able to delete apps that I didn’t want on the Roku, which I think is great. The remote has 4 buttons on it and they are Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and Sling TV, 3 of the 4 services we use so that was a very nice plus. The volume buttons work wonderfully. We can turn the TV on and off using the remote power button as well. The picture is clear and crisp and it’s being powered off the TV’s USB port. All in we are very happy with this device and I recommend it.

  Why did I not buy this sooner ! I’m loving this fire stick. Usually I use my Apple TV to watch things or mirror my apps to my tv, but it was always a pain to lose what I was doing while they were paired. This has so many more apps and is so easy to set up and use. I ended up buying two more for my other TVs. I love that I can just say what I’m looking for and bam, it’s right there.

  My Grandma got me this for my room and I did not like the fact that it did not have the volume and the powe off button. When I was setting it up it didn’t ask me for the Tv information, There fore it doesn’t work other than that I am super happy with the fact that it recognized my voice when I wanted to play something the other thing is that sometimes the thing will not work at all and I checked the internet connection and everything was ok and this is my second one. The other one was the one with the volume and the off and on button. And if anything else happens I will upgrade my review. And just as a side thing we do have another one in the living room and it’s been working fine and we love it so it may be just this one that isn’t working.

  I have one in all of the TV's at home. It provides fast access to the best apps if you don't have a smart tv and even if you do have a smart TV. If the internet is weak my smart tv seems to have problems loading Netflix, but my amazon stick always seems to gain access to a better connection so if my TV isn't working I can just use my amazon stick and watch my movies without a problem. Highly recommend !

  So this was me buying a replacement because the same unit that I bought 3 years ago simply crapped out. I think that I paid 35 dollars for the original. I kinda expected the unit to last more than 3 years. Also I have to keep freshening the battery contact on the new unit so yeah, not a high rating as I know that the equipment from other companies last longer with no maintenance.

  Device works as it should.  I got the fire lite for a old ""dumb"" lg tv.  All the apps you need.  So why the 3 stars?  You get tons of emails.  How to setup.

Completely unnecessary.

  Does what it's supposed to do. You just have to know what you're getting. I personally don't mind the lack of TV controls. But the low resolution takes some getting use to though. Can't complain though since (a) I was fully aware of what I was ordering and (b) it's just for a spare TV.  Over-all, it was a great buy for me because I caught this bad boy for $17. Go me! LOL!

I bought it for $21 and it is a great value!

  Not sure if we got a dud but when it works the voice recognition is fast and the streaming quality is clear and crisp. There are occasions(1-2 times a week) when the Amazon video app runs in slow-mo so we have to reset(unplug for 30 seconds) the fire stick. Strangely, the Disney app will reset the fire stick too. We've learned to live with these issues but it's annoying.

  The fire stick was easy to install. I just followed the simple directions on the tv screen. My tv picture is so much clearer. When I download a movie on my old stick it jumped , stalled and pixellated at the beginning of each show. Now my new stick automatically by my voice down loads a bright crisp movie or show for me to watch. No more waiting for circles to finish spinning.

  Plugged it in as a replacement for an earlier model without reading the manual.  Works fine but has a different home screen.  More options available but more steps to reach same program than the earlier model.  The extra button tunes to TV.  It is very close to the pause button and accidentally hitting it takes a few extra button presses to recover.  This happens often.

  These work well when they work.  This one is a backup since I have purchased others and they have lasted an average of 9-10 months.  Hopefully this will last longer.  Don't have much choice but to buy another when they go bad since you need them to stream and use prime to its full capacity.  I refuse to buy the more expensive models for fear they will not last either.

  I've had my fire stick for 3 years now. I thought I would try this to see if I can get better and more constant reception so I bought one. I love it.

Really like that part.Just ordered another one for the other TV.

  I already have a Roku, which I have never had a problem with. I ordered this because I wanted to be able to use HBO Max (which isn’t available on Roku) so I thought I’d try this. It wouldn’t turn on. I tried different outlets, used the WiFi extender it comes with, removed the WiFi extender, changed the batteries in the remote, etc. It came to the point that thought I just had to unplug it and plug it in every time. But even that isn’t 100% effective. As I am sitting here writing the review it comes up, flickers, then goes back to “No Signal”.Short story is that when it works, it works. But it’s not worth the stress that comes with trying to get it to work.

  Streaming is simple with the Fire TV Stick Lite. The TV remote is required to change inputs to the HDMI with the device, so TV controls on the Fire TV Stick Lite remote are not needed. A slight glitch in the first few days: the Stick was inoperable when we switched to its HDMI input. We had to unplug the power supply from the device and replug it. This rebooted the device right away. The glitch appears to have settled down with no intervention required for more than a week (we have had it 2 weeks). The initial glitch is why I gave rating of 4 rather than 5.

  I wanted something simple and low cost for my parents, so they could watch church services on the TV instead of the small laptop screen.  This was easy to setup and works very well.  I have been able to use it to show them several things they have enjoyed.  I have not tried using Alexa since it works just fine using the remote, even if it takes a bit longer.  When they are on sale again, I'll buy one for myself.

  My only complaint about the Fire TV Stick is it constantly warns you of insufficient power capabilities while using the USB cord in one of the TV's USB ports for power. Therefore, it forces you to use with the power adapter, which needs to be plugged in an outlet. Not sure if this is a design flaw with the Fire Stick or TV USB ports are worthless for power sources.

  I love the fire sticks in general. I purchased the Lite version for my smart TV that has gone stupid and have had no major issues. My only complaint is, lately both my Lite and regular fire stick are continually signing me out of Disney plus. Not sure if its due to Disney plus itself or the sticks themselves. I love the different streaming options I have with using the Fire Sticks and can usually find something to watch.

  I bought this just to stream my AppleTV movies and TV shows. This is a great inexpensive alternative to the AppleTV streaming box. It won't let you directly purchase or rent content from AppleTV however, so you have to do that through your AppleTV app on your computer or tablet/phone first. Not a big deal for me considering the price. Easy set up. It even automatically synced with my wireless sound bar. Picture quality is very good (it's 1080p but my TV upscales to 4K). The only negative is the sound quality is a little off, making it hard to understand dialogue sometimes.

  I love that amazon came out with an affordable fire stick! I love my fire stick, it is easy to use and allows me to stream my favorite shows. The only down side to this product is that i have to unplug and take apart the fire stick part that plugs into the tv. If i do not do this when i want to access the program then it doesn’t even pop up on my tv. hopefully this problem goes away on its own, if not that would be annoying.

  Since I'm using lots of Amazon services, I said it's time to move from Roku to Fire TV Stick, so that I'm getting a more ""integrated"" experience. This cannot be further from the truth. The Fire TV Stick becomes unresponsive many times, and the only solution to recover it is to reboot it. Also, when streaming movies, many times the video will freeze while audio continues.I never = zero times, experienced that with Roku. I'm switching back to Roku.

  I love this thing! I have used my PS4 for years as our home's ""media center device"". We use it for Hulu, Netflix, youtube, Amazon and many others. I bought the Fire Stick lite for my ""dumb"" TV upstairs. This fire stick is more intuitive and swaps streaming apps quicker than the PS4! I love the voice search option and you can easily see if you have the required app to view your search result. I have not integrated it with Alexa in my household yet. But I'm sure that'll be an adventure. If you're looking for a ""smart upgrade"" to your TV, you can't go wrong with this item.

  Highly recommend the firestick.  It was my first time purchasing. Next time I would get the upgrade with the volume and on/off settings so I don't have to keep track of two remotes. Manu free channels come with the one time purchase. All streaming services are available that you can sign in to your existing account or add more for a monthly fee ( if you choose).

  This is my 5th firestick I have bought!!! I love them!!! Easy to set up, easy to use!  Just plug in and follow the directions on screen! Each remote can work on different tv's with a fire stick! I just love them!!! We have three for the tv's here at home and two for the tv's on my houseboat! Makes life so much easier without paying an arm and leg for cable!!!!

  It is not entirely intuitive for non-techy folks but does work very well. It could be our internet connection, but the interface to the main menu in Prime is laggy. Alexa search is very accurate and helpful. This was actually our second one that we purchased for another tv in the house. I don't mind that there is no volume control since we are used to two remotes.

  I live in an area where the only internet is via satellite. So I got this for 'casting' to an older smart TV. That feature works great. What I didn't realize was how much better the fire stick is at pulling in the wifi signal. My TV is over 7 years old and doesn't see the 5.0 freq. It also has very few apps to choose from. This saved me from buying a newer TV.

  Very pleased with the improved streaming performance of this model over my older/original fire stick.  My rural internet service is not the  fastest but the increased memory, in this model,  has improved buffering making most streaming content seamless.  Other features pretty much same as my old model.  Remote control is OK for scrolling and selecting content.

  I had an older fire stick and when I was watching tv the sound would go on and off and I was getting a lot of pauses during shows and constantly had to reconnect to wifi. I thought I would try a new fire stick and see if that was the problem and sure enough it fixed all of the issues. My old stick was about five years old so I guess it was time for a new one!

  I mainly bought the Lite Stick to connect to a projector in my bedroom. As the projector model is not listed in the TV brand list when I had a 4k stick connected, not having volume controls on the remote was no big deal. Setup was fast and easy, along with sideloading of apps as well. Speed on this new stick is great, and I look forward to adding external memory to pimp it out even more in the future.

  I have been quite pleased with this ""Lite"" version of the Fire Stick.  I can monitor all my blink cameras on my TV screen with a simple voice command ""Show _(camera name)__"".  The Fire Stick itself is a great little device for TV's that may not be connected to cable or satellite but within WiFi range.  There is nice variety of things for your viewing pleasure.

  After a month the stick began changing channels all by itself including swapping apps.  Something that they never heard before.  CS thought it was the controller, the stick updates and tried 3 times until they just swapped out the stick itself.  Seems to be working fine. I have no problem working with tech staff. My previous fire stick lasted more than 10 years.

  Easy to set up.  Very user friendly, even my 5 yr old is able to use it.  The voice recognition works for all of my family members. Mainly purchased for the Disney + app since my TV doesn’t support it.  Works great with the fire stick though.  I have used this for a little over a month and my only complaint is that periodically there will be no sound at all coming from the TV when in firestick.  I will have to unplug it from the back of the TV and then replug it back in to get the sound to work again.

  Working good now - not a good look when your flagship software does not work properly on our own platform!  ------- Its been two weeks now and I'm still waiting for an update from Amazon customer support on a fix for the Audible app running on this Lite unit - works fine on the 4K version.  Basically, the app runs BUT your audio book library is not accessible.

  I don't like how it is set up now. In my opinion, it is much more difficult to use than previous fire sticks. So I put it on a tv that is in a bedroom only used when we have guests, and moved the older model to the tv I use frequently. I rarely use the voice recognition, and have never used the Alexa integration. But at least it works and the price was good.

  We already had a Firetv stick in the living room and was moving it to the exercise room then back to the living room.  It was time to get a second one to eliminate the rigamarole each time.  So glad we did. We are now considering two more, one for the Man Cave and one for the RV.As long as you have an Internet connection it is great!Excellent value!

  Bought this as an add-on for our guest bedroom. It's very much like a 2nd-gen Fire Stick, only with a newer interface and possibly a bit stronger processor. So, really, the difference between this unit and the non-4K 3rd-gen unit is the lack of TV controls, on-off and volume. So, you use the TV remote for those functions. AFAIK that's the only difference.

  We never could figure out the voice part, but that's fine as I got it for my kid anyway. I wish I'd have gotten one sooner after my last broke, as these are wonderful for tvs that don't connect to cable or are not smart tvs (older tvs) my kid can pretty much enjoy Disney plus, Netflix, hulu, whatever she wants (within parental limits) so it's perfect for me!

  Our old stick was about 7 years old. One day it wouldn't turn on anymore. Because of new models with 4K capability and universal like remotes, the closest thing to our old FireTV Stick was this model, but it runs the newer version of the software and the remote works even better than the old one. But the price was just right. Very happy with the purchase.

  It’s got a different layout, and it no longer has easy access to second party apps, amazon wants you to purchase apps from the stick, and to boot the icons for apps it tiny. No , I am glad I have the older ones, this one made my head spin. And to boot, it did not carry over all my apps, I had to re down load everything. What a pain . Do I recommend, no.

  So I ordered this due to no place to mount a roku box and it works perfectly however due to the fact my TV is wall mounted the cord that comes out of the USB roku unit itself from the TV creates weight so as you can see from photograph if your electric outlet isn’t high enough it’s going to get pulled down on. The wire has already pulled out once so I will have to improvise and plug all cords into thick electric cord and mount it up behind tv to prevent it from pulling out due to the weighted force of the cord. Other than that it’s perfect.

  Works in my basement far from our WiFi box.  There is a lot of electrical wire, furnace ducts, flooring the signal needs to get through.  My previous one went bad after a few years, now it’s working much better.  Our internet provider may have something to do with the slow load speed.  The TV it’s connected to is also getting old so that doesn’t help.  Overall though it works well.

  1. Like the wireless extender2. The  volume controls3. Voice commands4. Nice to have the one time, single sign on to multiple apps for cable provider setup5. Noticed apps like NBC and CNNgo don’t buffer/freeze nearly as much as on other streaming brands.6. Cool to see the The new Disney apple command button on remote as well as Hulu7. Also, the ROKU has way more apps that aren’t found on Fire or Apple like surprisingly the Paramount Network. Was happy to know that so I can watch episodes of the popular Yellowstone series for FREE.8. Like the commercials timer countdown so you know exactly how many minutes remain before your show returns9. Finallly received the update HBOMAX that replaced HBOgo.

  I probably just jinxed myself for putting that out there but this is almost too good a deal to believe, Comcast has a (beta) Roku app which allows you to watch everything you would through your Xfinity box with this Roku stick and there is no additional monthly fee.  I didn't think it was worth the money to pay for an extra Xfinity box for the bedroom but there were plenty of occasions where we wished we could go up to the bedroom to finish watching a movie or TV program but couldn't.  Now everything we can do in the living room on the main TV we can also do in the bedroom, watch recorded programs, pause live TV, watch on demand, etc. Can't recommend this enough, just worried Comcast will figure out this is too good of a deal and screw it up.

  Installed easily.  Works well with PBS, Sling and AirTV2.  Muting the sound was almost a deal breaker, but it seems Roku finally conceded that a mute button is a necessity.  If you buy, be sure you're gettting a remote with a mute button.  There are probably still a bunch, like mine, without one.  Otherwise, you'll have to pay $20 for a replacement remote.  For me, not having mute, was like going back to the 60's.2 issues that might be important: 1. support is off-shore and, from my experience, of the quality people make jokes about.  Support people seem to have almost no experience with the product and their only priority is getting you to give up.  You'll have to depend on the user group which is good.  2. The user experience is clumsy, not intuitive, awkward and poorly documented but if you work at it you'll usually figure it out.In the end, it is a good replacement for cable TV when used with some of the other products (""channels"") it supports.

  Make sure you go to the roku  page to activate, there are scammers trying to get you to pay to set it up.I made a few errors before I got to the  correct page, but then It was pretty straight forward, and NO COST.I plan to use in different rooms in the house, and take on the road when traveling. I had no issue with the plugs not being long enough, they provided all that was needed. Our cable company doesn’t have Hulu rights so this was one way to watch our. Hulu subscription.Happy with purchase.

  I have several Roku streaming sticks and have been happy with them. My WiFi signal was weak in some locations in my house so I decided to purchase a WiFi mesh extender. The installation of the mesh extender was simple and I had the benefit of single SSID. All my phones and laptops connected to the mesh network without issue, and would switch to the which ever access point had the strongest signal. The problem is that my Roku devices will not connect to the WiFi mesh network. The Roku can see the network, but it is unable to connect after I enter the network password. If I disable the Wifi extender, it can still connect to my router. I contacted Roku technical support and they suggested resetting the WiFi settings, which did not work, or that I contact the router manufacture. I reached out to Netgear and they spent a long time on the phone with me, but the only solution they could come up with was to switch the extender out of mesh network mode with single SSID. With the extender functioning as a separate access point, my Roku devices can connect, but I have lost the benefit of a WiFi mesh extender. Roku tech support is a terrible robo email system with automated responses. I could not get a hold of a person and they refused to even look into this being an issue with Roku. While researching this problem, I found that there are many other people online who have reported the same issue. I usually do not pay much attention to bad reviews, but if you have or are considering purchasing a WiFi mesh extender, then you should consider looking for a different streaming device unless Roku decides to upgrade their devices.

  Tough to select stars for this - I do like the Roku price and the user interface, picture quality and general usability are all 5-star but the overheating and power warnings are a 1 star regular issue. As I have both I might return and try another.This Plus stick is connected by cables only so there is no relevant heat from the TV or receiver. This is in a ~70 degree-F room so ambient temp should not be a factor either. The only way to prevent overheating is to lay it flat against a heat sink. Also, it is already connected with the included AC adapter and extension cable but regularly indicates there is not enough power.

  I finally decided to take the plunge and get a streaming stick. So I did my research and chose to go with Roku. And I’m sure glad I did! Set up so easy, and I haven’t had any issues with functionality at all. I was uncertain whether to get the 4K stick or not, especially since my big screen television is not a 4K television. However, despite having a HDMI television, the Roku stick has worked fine. I recommend going with the 4K stick anyway, because the decision has already been made by the industry; 4K, whether you feel it’s overhyped/overrated or not will be the next wave.I love the interface of Roku. I couldn’t imagine an easier interface to navigate around and select what apps I want to watch. Another thing that swayed me toward Roku over the other streaming devices was that Roku doesn’t have a dog in the race so to speak. They will add any app that they feel is worthy to their system. Compare that to the other streaming sticks, who will heavily push their own apps while omitting certain apps, and Roku was the no brainer. You really get a whole lot of options with Roku. I’m very happy with my purchase!

  I have several Roku & Fire sticks and all work very good.  But I like the Roku little bit more.  This one ""Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote"" started having problems with connectivity after a week and by the 2nd week I had to restart it many times in order to get connected.  Eventually, in the third week there was no connection at all.  Called Amazon and they were nice enough to send a second one the next day.  After testing the second one, I noticed that the stick and remote is working fine.  The only culprit here was the advanced wireless receiver.  If you have a connection problem, the most likely reason is the little cord that gets directly attached to the Roku stick.

  I've had an amazing fire stick, which I've loved for years now. I needed a streaming device and since I had several fire sticks, I (reluctantly) gave Roku a try. My son needs a streaming device and asked for one of these. I love it. It was easy to set up, easy to download all the apps, works beautifully with my Amazon accounts, and the Roku channel just about covers everything I watch! I will save so much money ditching satellite ask together now! Versus the first stick... If say they do the exact same things. Fire stick allows the Roku channel to be downloaded and Roku allows the Amazon video app, so they're basically equal. Both have the ability to ask it to find what you want, and both were equally good at it! I'm glad two great companies carry such great products. That being said, Roku is just a tiny bit easier to add apps, only because it goes through one account (roku) instead of having to order through each seperated company. Highly recommended!

  I cannot count on this devise to work.I cannot count on being able to listen to the programs or movies - Prime.Prime is also suggesting not Prime content...but, that which I would have to pay for.???WHERE IS THE VOLUME?  It will sometimes come through, with previews, and then....nothing.Again, where is the volume?  And Shame on you for Prime content, not necessarily free or me.Lastly, this device hangs down and gravity - I think - Un plugs it.  Thus, nothing works at all.km.

  This upgrade to the original fire tv stick is much improved.  It is very easy to install and its use has been much improved by using Alexa.  Just ask Alexa for a specific movie, genre, or actor/actress and presto, the search appears on the screen immediately. If you wait until the fire tv stick is available in a package deal on either HSN or QVC,you'll save yourself some $$.

Added Discovery+ and Disney+ for $18 a month extra but still saving over $100 a month for way more programming. Bought rabbit ears for $12 and get free local programs. Tons of free program apps on Firestick too. I can't brag on this any more.

  I bought it so I could have access to the hbo max app and roku didnt have it at the time. Now it does. . . . This thing doesnt let you sign into your tv provider on half the apps it offers. You go through the trouble of typing it all out only for it to ask again. And again. . . And again.  . . There is no easy way to close apps (not even the alexa will do it) and it freezes up all the time so you have to uninstall the apps and reinstall and enter login info all over again. Cool idea. Bad execution.I enjoy having the screensaver but there is no option to get it to continuously play. It always goes to sleep.

  When HBO expanded to include HBO Max, as I subscribe to HBO, I was eligible to receive both. I have a ROKU model that unfortunately was unable to link to the HBO Max app so I picked up this firestick. Not only did it make receiving HBO Max possible but the other apps that I had on my ROKU work better on the Amazon product. Low price and great performance, easy to install and use.

  I'm so glad I bought this. We finally cut the cord on cable TV and we don't miss it. There is far more interesting free content to watch than we will ever get around to watching. The video and sound quality are great. It is easy to use once you play with it for a while. We loaded the Disney+ app and several free streaming services and it all works well. We will save $1500 per year by cancelling our cable.

  Roku  has not evolved into a customer friendly tool to enhance your TV experience because it is too complicated in its application.  The directions are clear and simple, except they don't work,  Following these directions  you go on line to the ROKU site only to discover many, many separate entities advertising how they will help you bring ROKU on line, for a price.  I could not find the real ROKU . com in all this maize.  I therefore gave up on google on my PC and went to another search engine Apple, success, but at a price.  Simply put, I would do it their way, via computer interaction.  You know the routine, check the correct box, etc..  Never are you allowed to talk to someone on the telephone, text yes, talk no. I could have progressed through many telephone conversations in the time I spent texting with ROKU.  Meanwhile ROKU advertises that it does not charge for installation.  Unfortunately, Amazon Prime was and yet remains the most difficult application through ROKU,  The directions for PRIM take you to Amazon, period.  No, Prime through ROKU directions, just Amazon and where do you want to go from here.  I finally did locate the page on directions for PRIME listing  every instrument of access except ROKU, as in Fire Stick, Play Station,  Apple, etc..  ROKU INSTALLATION of today is not easy as it was before.  It is very, very, difficult.

  OK...I've got three LG TVs. None have an app for ESPN+. One (my OLED) is just old enough it won't run CBS All Access. I've used my Apple TV with the third. Why not go Apple TV all the way around? The remote sucks (and yes, I'm an Apple guy). If the Apple remote was as good as the Roku remote I'd run with it. I bought a Logitech Harmony remote. WAY to complicated for my wife. So, I decided to try the Roku after researching features and the remote. Took less than a minute to explain to my wife how to use it. Setup was brilliantly easy (as easy as my Apple TV). This thing was so simple to setup and use that I ordered two more for the other tvs. The Apple TV is going to be my home hub and no longer do TV service. All because of a remote.

  The remote sucks to high heaven!!  You can put all the fresh new batteries in all day, but the remote may not work.  For some inexplicable reason, the remote will just stop working at random times.  SOO ANNOYING.  The first time it happened to me, was less than a week after I got the ROKU brand new.  I think the device is good, but if this is what I have to deal with, with the remote, I'll never purchase ROKU again stick.  Maybe I'll give the Firestick.

  I was using a 4k Roku Ulta with my Onkyo Amp as Pass Thru.  It flicker a lot and I am not sure is it the cable I had or what causes the problem. (it does'n't flicker with my other TV that I connected straight to it)  So I purchase this 4k Stick when it was on sale and it solved the problem.  At first I was afraid the wireless won't be fast enough to handle 4k quality Pic content, but I wouldn't see the difference compare to my ultra connected with wired connection.Update 07/28/2020The Roku Streaming Sticks + started to randomly restarts itself like 10 times a day.  I know that is not normal with Roku.  I contacted Roku and they are willing to do a replacement with me. I don't like they will have me pay the shipping and ship it off to them before I can get a replacement.  So I had a week without having a Roku in my living room to watch shows with.  SO I changed it from 5 stars to 4 stars

  I've had 3 Roku streaming devices for approximately 12 months and have become disappointed with all. I have 50 mbps internet download speed, ROKU connection check indicates excellent Wifi  and I continue to have several problems that I haven't experienced with Fire TV. 1) Frequent buffering that causes screen to go blank and 2) System locks up at times when 1st turn on and during channel search 3) The recommendation and procedure to clear the Cache does not work for me (maybe doing something wrong but did not work while I was being helped online). I have to go to Home, System, Restart... yet this doesn't always correct the buffering. Extremely frustrated. Primarily occurs with HULU but also occurs with NETFLIX at times.

  Not sure why we didn’t do this before! I installed them in all of our TVs and in minutes I was watching hundreds of channels and movies for free.  We  immediately cancelled our cable subscription and are adding more and more channels, most for a minimal monthly fee.The Best feature is the remote, it cannot be more simple to operate! And I love the voice recognition feature - just say the name of a show, movie or actor and it finds all channels where you can find said movie, etc.

  I love the Roku UI. It truly surpasses the Fire Stick, so I was looking to replace my older generation Roku for our living room. This connected very easily to my existing Roku account and downloaded all of my previous apps. So far the interface is working well and the streaming quality is wonderful. The seller was awesome, they shipped the item super quickly and I received within 4 days of ordering.

  We first tried the Chromecast by Google and it was very annoying.  It doesn't have a remote, so you have to use your phone.  The interface was clunky and it had problems connecting. So we returned the Chromecast and got this Roku and it is simply FANTASTIC. Here are the bonuses:1) The apps load much faster than the TV's own built-in apps (for Netflix, for example)2) It has a remote!  The remote has a microphone which allows you to search for shows across ALL AVAILABLE streaming apps.  This feature is incredibly helpful.3) The remote acts as a power button and volume button. It somehow knows how to control the volume controls on your TV.4) You can take it anywhere, such as on vacation, and it works just like at home as long as you have access to WiFi.

  I would like to start this review off by noting the ups and downs of my experiences owning this item. To start, what is included with this item? You get the streaming stick +, a plug, a USB extender to make it easier for the plug to connect to the TV, and the remote. Roku will ask you to set up an account. This is no issue if you do not plan on buying anything extra.The first stick I got had to be returned due to the remote going out and connecting/disconnecting to the TV. The next one I got did not have this issue. I tested this stick out using different apps on the device including YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, and Prime Video. My main purpose for getting this device was for Prime Video as I wanted to be able to watch shows included with my Prime membership without having to watch on my PC. Prime Video lacks in quality when streaming. For example, I watch the show Grimm although, for some strange reason when the video is supposed to move to the next episode, I often get an error message stating that Prime Video is having difficulties. I am then either forced out of the app, or have to exit the app and go back in and hope that the app allows me to click on and play the next episode. Another issue with Prime video, is that there seems to be this ""noise"" like effect on the TV screen when watching episodes of Grimm which is very notable in dark scenes during the episodes. I have no issues with noise happening through YouTube, Spotify, or Netflix so I believe that this a Prime specific issue.Speaking of these other apps, they have had their issues in the past. Spotify has been highly stable with basically little to no problems. YouTube, however, has this weird affect when starting or going back to a point within a video, the audio speeds up super fast for 2 to 3 seconds. It is nothing terrible, but noticeable. What was further noticed by me was when I rented a movie, Batman Hush, on YouTube through the stick, and was not able to watch the movie with a friend through the device. Fortunately, I had a smart TV, and we were able to watch the movie though it. Though it is unfortunate that I had to switch to the smart TV in order view what I had purchased.Netflix also had its fair share of problems when streaming through the stick. When first starting up the Roku stick, the device gives you the option of auto detecting the TV. This option ultimately did not work well for me.  My TV is a Westing House 50-inch 4K ultra-HD TV-HDR. I had to change the setting on the stick to 4K 60Hz. The reason being was that Netflix would have this ""stuttering"" effect when trying to watch any movie or show in a higher quality than what I described. Ultimately this would result in needing to unplug the device so it could reset itself.The verdict:Personally, this stream stick + has been an advantage to have. I can listen to music on my TV through Spotify, Netflix no longer has the issues as described, and the voice controls work very well. Although, I would encourage people to have a smart TV if you want truly reliable streaming in apps such as Netflix and YouTube.

  it plugs in to an HDMI jack on the TV. It comes with a cord that will connect to a USB port on the TV to provide power, meaning no wall wart or extra cable running from the TV to the wall. Easy setup.

  This is a simple plug and play device.  With good WIFI, you can stream all kinds of free and pay programing.As I do not use Alexa in my home, it integration is something I cannot comment on.The installation instructions were easy and the software installation was fast.Very happy to extend the life of an older TV for use in a guestroom.

  This is the 5th Firestick the other higher end models never a issue I have this is the 2nd one of the base model do yourself a favor spend the extra money.  I have to pull this model in and out to get the audio to reset and work.  I have 2 Sony TVs XBR 1 Bravia and a Panasonic and a Vizio ugh Hot Tub TV the base model has issues almost on all of them.

  Everything was great as expected with a Fire TV except the fact I was reminded more times then a care to upgrade from my first generation fire TV which had a USB plug for my Bluetooth keyboard. The least Amazon can do is include a measly $1-$2 dollar cord to add a USB port. I had to spend extra money to buy an additional adapter to add a USB plug since the fire tvs don't have the USB anymore. Honestly not happy about it. Amazon charges $20-30 for a replacement remote and other 3rd party vendors sell firetv remotes with keyboards on back for the same price. Maybe Amazon can offer a fire TV remote with keyboard on back.

  This is the 3rd power tv stick I have bought.  The first 2 worked fine.  The 3rd one does not.It will not power on unless I unplug and replug the power from the power stick.  I have to do this each time I want to use it.  The voice command system gives a blue light bar but no beep and won't respond to commands.I have read numerous reviews of poor quality on this item and cannot understand why the manufacturers don't improve it.

  I don't care for or use voice control. For me it is a useless feature. It is harder and slower trying to find things. Instead of clicking on choices that are presented you end up having to drag a blue circle around and click  on what you want to watch once you locate it. To scroll up and down it is necessary to place the blue circle to the top of the page if going up or to the bottom if going down. When doing a search it is not possible to jump from the letter display to titles listed to the left , a process that could speed up locating shows. I mainly watch u-tube it is harder to get on to u-tube now its gone from about2 steps to 3-4 steps now. I still have my older model firestick CE0984 and would gladly trade the current firestick light version for  the older version. Unless I am not using this device correctly I don't think that this is an improvement

  Very pleased with this!  Up and running in minutes.  Plenty of 'free' viewing options with my account login for my cable company in addition to Prime options and included free apps.  Purchased for the TV in a spare room...I didn't want the expense of renting yet another cable box or the hassle of running the cables.  This is the perfect solution.  Minor streaming delays if my WiFi is being used by too many devices, but this happens rarely

  We have a 10 year old high definition TV. With the wireless cable box we have excellent  sound and picture. With the fire TV stick we have excellent picture terrible sound. There must be something wrong with the fire TV stick .I will be sending it back to Amazon for replacement. I Like the way the fire TV stick works except for the sound quality. We have high speed internet service and the wireless cable tunerbox has no trouble streaming a excellent picture and sound on the same TV. So it not our internet. The fire TV stick was very easy to set up the controls on it worked perfectly I would of given it 5 stars if it did have a sound problem.

  I love being able to use the apps.  This is very easy to use, I’m not very tech savvy.  Even I was able to hook it up.  I had an older fire stick but it quit working plus I had to constantly buy new batteries.  This one is great and the batteries ate lasting so much longer.  I highly recommend this.  I haven’t actually tries using the voice control.

  This is just a very basic model with no bells or whistles and that is what I wanted.  We have the ultimate premium deluxe version in the family room and love that too.  This model doesn’t have the voice recognition feature but I knew that.  It still provides all the same channels and experience and works with the Google home.  Recommend for the thrifty who don’t need to be pampered.

  This works great but for like $10 more you can get it to where it will turn on and off your TV and turn up and down your volume so you only have to use 1 remote. So unless your just really broke or prefer to use 2 remotes I recommend buying the fire stick with tv controls but it works fine Alexis works fine I love having a fire stick it has saved me so much money every month by not having to pay a cable or satellite bill. I get all kinds of tv for free plus you can buy your favorits too.

  The product itself functions well. Easy setup, decent menu system, and you can use the phone app as a remote when the batteries die and you're too lazy to get out of bed. However, one of the biggest reasons I went with Roku years ago was that they were an agnostic device that wasn't pushing their own streaming service. That also meant they were largely separate from the disputes that were affecting the Fire TV and restricting app choice. Well here we are almost 3 months after the HBO Max launch and still no agreement and no app. If that's not fixed in the next month or so then I'll just put my Rokus on Craigslist and buy Fire TVs because at least I can sideload apps on that device.

  The only terrible thing about this amazing device is that it uses all of our WiFi and we have to unplug and put in airplane mode all of our iPads and cells just to get it working. Service Electric is our provider and if you know about them then you will understand. But it’s wonderful I can’t believe we have gone this long with out the fire stick.

  I tried to get HULU on my 4 year old Vizio Smart TV. Although Netflix and Amazon Prime worked great (or so I thought) HULU kept starting and stopping while it buffered. A major disappointment since it had content not available on the other two.A little research suggested that the receiver on the Vizio was the problem. I ordered the Roku on the assumption that if it didn't work I could return it.The setup was amazingly simple! Plug it in, attach the cord, follow the on-screen prompts. 10 minutes and I was up and running. When the content was up on the screen I realized what I was missing. I had a 4k monitor but was only streaming 780 because of the receiver. The Roku bypassed this to deliver the full 4k + better sound!! As the title said, it was like getting a brand new TV for only $60! Plus the Roku remote controls the TV and sound bar better than their own remotes. One control to do it all.One minor complaint that is more a note to Roku than a problem. Why no back lit remote? TVs operate in the dark and I would have happily paid an extra dollar for the feature.

  I have an older Smart Tv and I was having issues with the apps crashing while I was using them. Or they would lose connection to the WIFI. A friend recommended getting a Roku. I did some researched and I felt that this one was what I needed for my TV and steaming needs.When I went shopping, I saw that Amazon had the best deal and because I have Prime it was here the next day!Installation was pretty simple and straight forward. The only thing that might cause problems for others is the cord from the stick to an outlet. Mine stretched justs fine but someone else might find it too short depending on how far your TV is from an outlet.Once it's up and running you do have to take the time to sign in to all your accounts but after that, it's done.Since I have bought this I have not had any of my streaming apps crash. It's easy to use and the voice option is amazing! I love how it will look for titles that are on all streaming services and not just one.I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is on the market for a streaming stick.

  We were using a Sony Blue Ray DVD player for streaming and the experience was far from perfect. As the product aged its performance grew worse and worse. At the end we couldn't get through a 30 minute episode of a TV show without suffering the dreaded spinning wheel and the message ""Insufficient bandwidth to play your program.""Then we bought a Roku.It was like walking out of a dark cave and into the light. Superior picture quality, easy set up, simple but functional remote and an overall superior viewing experience was suddenly our reality.Don't hesitate if you are considering this purchase. You won't be sorry and you'll never look back.

  I was expecting a bit more out of this more expensive product. I don't have 4K but I wanted the voice remote  so I bought this one.  It works well just too things, I get 1001 errors spastically that cuts off the video I'm watching which is a disconnect from the network thing.  Not sure what the issue is (I understand they interrupt the streaming if you have been idle for quite awhile so you don't blow up data from mobil services) and I did do some research that says go into Roku settings, screensaver and unclick ""timeouts"" to off.  This is a feature that once again if idle on one station for how ever long you set the minutes too, it goes to sleep with a screensaver you select.  My biggest disappointment is the voice remote because it only works with the Roku home page does not operate on the app menu for live TV....Update: You have to be right on top of the TV for the remote to work so that means I have to get off the couch and go to the TV to increase the volume change channels etc. The purple rubber select/directional part is flimsy and I have to press it several times to get it to react.  You know this is a real disappointment given Roku has been out there and a main player in Streaming to wind up with such a cheaply made product and given what this cost.

  Love this thing! The biggest reason I bought this is because it has a Beta app to stream from my cable company. I love that I can connect with my cable company's DVR and watch shows in the bedroom and not have to pay for another box or run wires over there. There is nothing better than sticking it to my cable provider,  they suck eggs. I use Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and others. The High Definition is clear and fast. Personally I think this is far better than any of the Amazon or Google products. Hook it up and enjoy. Plus save yourself a few sheckles buy not having to pay more to the Cable Gods!

  I just installed it and watched a few minutes of Netflix so this is an initial review. If things change I'll edit this review and add additional comments in the future.I bought this device because Netflix will no longer stream on my Wii game box after Jan 30 2019 so I thought I'd upgrade.Installation took me about 40 minutes using the roku remote on my TV and also signing up for  a roku account online with a code provided on the TV. I only wanted Netflix and nothing else at present so online I had to uncheck all the other services roku automatically wanted to sign me up for.Roku also requires a payment method in case you buy services in the future so I was glad to see I could select Paypal instead of a credit card as a payment method. Whenever there is a Paypal charge Paypal sends me an email the same day so this seemed more secure to me than providing a credit card number.I had to enter my router and router password on the TV while initializing the roku, and also login to my Netflix account.Hopefully this info will be saved and so I can get to Netflix by just pressing the Netflix button on the roku remote in the future.Once on Netflix it took a while to realize that tapping the left arrow twice was required to get to the Netflix controls on the left side of the screen, like search, my list, etc.Netflix on my Wii was upscaled 720 P  so I had a fairly large black box border around the movies. On the roku I selected 1080P in the settings and got a great full screen image without black box borders on the first movie I tested. It's likely 1080P would have been selected automatically had I not gone to the roku settings menu.I plugged the roku device into my Vizio TV hdmi 4 slot and used the extension cord in order to plug the roku into a power supply near the TV. It was just long enough, but if it hadn't been I would have used an electric extension cord.

  I got this so I could get local stations and have found I can't.  Disappointed in that.However, it is easy to install and after a few false starts, easy to use.  I have caught up on all the programs I missed when my satellite company cut off some of my stations and I'm finding lots of movies I want to watch and older programs that I had forgotten about, I'm watching again.Definitely worth the money, even if it doesn't get my local stations.

  Had no problem with any of the functions with this Roku Stick or hand remote communications even though the Roku stick was located in back of my TV. Setup was a breeze! Just plugged it into one of my LG 55"" Smart TVs HDMI ports on back of TV. Then installed the USB power pig tail to the TVs USB port located close by. Than went online with my computer to activated my new Roku stick. Supplied installation/activation instructions were easy to follow.  Found my new Roku stick was responding much faster with greater picture quality over my old 8+ year old Roku box/cable player. Really love the voice command and TV volume control functions on the new remote.

  My brother and I were splitting a cable package for about $150.00 a month and he told me they were raising  the price again! I said get rid of it and he did, then I baught this Roku unit not expecting much but it was cheap and had to better than nothing.My old cable was pretty lousy, I could hardly ever find a good movie to watch so I was astounded to see the quantity and quality of the movies available on Roku. I only watch the free channels and there seems to be thousands of great movies from 1937 to the present, more than I could ever watch.I am amazed that expensive cable companies are still in business, if everybody knew how good Roku is they would be out of business in a month.  To think we were spending $1700.00 a year for garbage and for a one time cost of $ 44.00 got something 100 times better!It is a no brainer to buy a Roku unit.

  I spent two hours trying to get this things hooked up to replace a Roku device I had for years.  It would take me through all of the stages and would say that the connection was complete.  But as soon as I pushed the ""home"" button it went back to the original set-up routine.  ""Customer service"" didn't help--the chat person kept referring me back to the instruction video.  Now, when I have tried to return it, Amazon no longer sends you the label you can print but gives a scan code.  That is also totally useless because it will not print!  Amazon has dropped the ball on customer service,

  I've been a Roku user for around 3 years.  Bought the Firestick on sale for Black Friday.  I much prefer the user interface of the Roku compared to the Firestick.  The only reason to buy it is to get the Firestick exclusives not available on Roku.  Maybe I'm just too used to using the Roku system, but if someone had never used either, I would steer them to the Roku.

  Tengo un TV que no es Smart con un sólo puerto HDMI y recibí un Fire Stick Lite 2020 como regalo para poder ver la app Rakuten Viki que no funciona en mi otro modelo de TV Box. El Fire Stick sólo funciona en el puerto HDMI del TV, no reconoce el adaptador de puertos múltiples uno a tres HDMI que tenía en funcionamiento con el Cable Box y TV Box conectado. Las aplicaciones integradas como YouTube tengo que proyectarla desde mi celular ya que tengo dos nombres de usuario bajo una misma cuenta y el app de YouTube en Fire TV sólo reconoce una. Las app de las redes sociales OK.ru y VK.ru no las reconoce, aún utilizando un programa de transferencia de apps del celular al Fire. Programa como AllCast tampoco funciona se instala correctamente pero no proyecta. Más adelante podré dar más información según vaya utilizándolo. Yo lo recomiendo. 🙌

  Amazon lockers are located in an unsuitable area, the area that my package was located at was a 7 eleven in Benning road n.e Washington, D.C. the lockers are located outside of the 7 eleven on a dark side of the store and no security cameras were visible or any lighting where the lockers are. As I was retrieving my package I observed what seemed to be a hobo on the side of the building nearby the lockers with his pants halfway down defecating.. the experience was terrify and I feared for my safety.

  This is my 3rd Fire Stick.  I replaced the first one because I lost the remote (of course, then I discovered the Google app to control it from your phone).  The 2nd one has always worked well, for several years now.  The new one is going to a new TV.As always, it just works.  Voice control calls up movies, etc., without a hitch.  If you are a Prime member and/or have an Alexa device, this is the streaming device you need.

It doesn't have volume control or turn on/off TV feature; I now use two different remotes.

  It is fast and fun to use! Much faster than our 9 yr old Roku.

Uploads of movies and TV shows are faster. Everything seems clearer and more colorful, too.  We are enjoying it a lot!

Can’t speak for the rest of the rest of it because I didn’t play with it after I didn’t find what I wanted- Spanish language channels.To give as a gift, I just needed at least the two big ones- Univision and Telemundo.

  I replaced my first generation Fire stick with this, and it is much improved. The set up is a breeze, controls are intuitive, and it has worked without any issues. Most importantly, our aging smart TV was constantly having issues with network connections and buffering. This solved all of these issues for a really low price. If you have Prime this is a no brainer.

  I love that I can legally locate most any shows or movies I want to see. I have cable and some apps that give me more choices for viewing, but frankly, I think I waste a lot of money because the majority of the shows on cable are awful. The same is true of the network offerings. With my fire stick, I am seriously considering canceling my cable or at least cutting back to the absolute basics.

  It works fine. The only complaint I have is that 70% of the time when I turn my TV back on or wake up the fire stick I will not have any sound and will then have to restart the fire stick to get the sound back. It doesn't sound like a huge deal, but it can be very annoying when it happens so frequently, and to do a restart you have to hunt through some menus or go physically unplug the device. If the remote had a power button, it might not be so frustrating.

  This is my third fire tv product. The first froze up and, after 90 minutes on the phone with tech support, it became obvious that it was irreparable. So I bought a second one. After almost a year of use, it began returning error messages about no memory space available, even though we added nothing to it. I am told that Amazon pushes ads and other junk to it that take up space. We bought the third unit to replace the second and we wiped the second unit and loaded current versions. It now functions as before. However there are two issues: 1. Both units are creeping upwards in used disk/memory space. 2. all units come loaded with ""features"" that have no practical application in our world. We'd like to delete them, but we cannot. Sadly, these features take up a lot of disk memory and contribute to the issues I described.

  Purchased one 4 yrs ago and the remote stopped working or so I'm guessing. So I purchased my second one for the tv in the living room. I like using my Fire stick, it's easy to maneuver. I have one on all three of my televisions, I know they say you can use one on all 3, just move by moving them around but I didn't want to have to disconnect it and wait for it to reprogram. So it was worth it to put one on each tv and they are not that expensive when you buy from Amazon. Thank you Amazon.

  Love it! Especially that I can control the volume from my Roku remote. I had an older addition in my living room that did not have volume control on that remote. I read reviews before buying & can happily say that I had no issues with the signal from my remote reaching my Roku device from across the room. The only thing is it does stay running even when you turn the tv off, therefore when I go to the living room to watch Netflix it will say that too many devices are using this account, & it's because the bedroom was streaming it when I turned the tv off but the roku stayed on. No big deal though, not Roku's fault. I now have a smart Roku TV that I absolutely love. Team Roku over here!!

  I don't understand why they wouldn't have added at least a small heat sync to this device. It works well, but if the temp of the room gets above 78 or so, it can overheat. It warns  you, but the only option, since it also doesn't have the ability to power off, is to reach behind the tv and pull the power, or shut off the TV. While ideal for a guest room where they would mostly only be using the device, that would be fine. For your main living room media center it can present an issue. The whole time your TV is on, the stick is on, even if you are watching cable on another input. Would it overheat and you would never know? I don't know yet.

  I always read reviews, check out review sites like TechRadar...  After reading many glowing reviews on the Roku Streaming Stick+, I decided it was worth a go.  Installation was extremely easy.  I live in a 3000+ sq ft house, and the wireless access point is downstairs on the other side of the house.  The Roku stick picked it up immediately and has yet to drop it.  After 2 weeks and nearly flawless performance, I pulled the plug on my provider.  I don't miss 800+ channels (many redundant) and my nearly $300 monthly bill.  The kids one demand was a TV channel that rhymes with 'Rick'.  So for the cost of wireless, an Indoor antenna (sold in a green box) for local channels, and minimal subscription costs to 3 streaming services (First letters N, H and P, in case I'm not supposed to mention names), I get everything the family wants and only a wireless bill.  I advise providing power to the stick via AC power vs USB.  In my case, every time the TV power was turned off, power to the stick was removed, and it had to go through a reboot cycle next time the TV was turned on.  Doesn't happen on AC power.  Gets a bit hot, but nothing out of the ordinary.  And unless I have to change the TV Input source or TV channels to select signals provided by the Indoor Antenna, the Roku remote controls my TV power, volume  and allows me to select programs via voice input.  For the cost, a GREAT bargain!  Goodbye, cable TV.

  Install went smoothly. There is/was no activation fee as clearly stated in manual. They wanted a credit card but clearly install was not chargeable and there were no hidden fees. There is nothing nefarious in requesting a card if it's for their own protection. You still have to pay for for subscriptions such as Amazon Prime and Netflix which are separate from the purchase price of this hardware. I had no connection problems with this stick. I still see some buffering issues but I'm not sure how much is due to my provider or the hardware. Either way it's been minimal and far better than my original stick which was one of the first ones made by the company. I'm satisfied. If I had any wants on the controls it would be for them to be backlit and maybe the mute button placement. I don't know what that would do to battery life or costing. Either way it's not a deal-breaker.

  it disconnected access to internet on what ever I had it connected to... my l/r tv. bedroom tv, and my computer.  so I returned it.  my daughter's roku stick (not this model) worked fine on my stuff.  While the one I bought was hooked up to the tv, it couldn't connect because it said no internet.  but at the same time my kindle, phone, and computer had access to internet.  My internet supplier couldn't help me... they said everything was fine on their end.

  I've used a cheaper Roku device for years and have been pleased with the streaming speed and really like the interface. It's easy to set up and doesn't take long to get to my favorite channels.  I recently cut my cable and went with Hulu for local/live channels not available on my antenna. I needed a new stick since my TiVo's won't do Hulu live. I had been happy with Roku so I went with Roku Streaming Stick+.That's when I learned how painful it was to get through to a real live person. I realize that companies would like you to check for help online but Roku has made it into an art form.I do have a product-specific comment that I hope will help. I've included a photo to show the location of the Mute button. I love the remote but I can't use it without continuing to press the mute button. Luckily, the mute button doesn't make a major impact on my use or it could be a real problem.

  In my bedroom, my computer hardly gets a signal, not steady. The TV is beyond the desktop, further from the router, but the Roku keeps a steady stream so far. I'm impressed and glad I paid extra for the longer reaching device. Also, this device is much faster than the roku in my living room, right by my router. Can't compare much to the Firestick cause it arrived defective, only I didn't know it. I thought it was the TV, and nearly scrapped my 3 year old 40+ inch tv. Super glad I didn't! Go Roku!!!

  I have or had one of just about every type of streaming box/stick but this 4K Roku streaming stick + has a cleaner interface, seemingly more options (or at least easier to setup & use), more comfortable remote and more that has made it my streamer of choice. So much so, I've ordered one for myself and set this purchase up for my wife to provide a faster processor for our broadband cable service rather than use the app from our 'smart' TV whose processor was slower and less dependable. I have one pet peeve though. The little buttons at the bottom of the remote that has pre-programmed Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ & Sling would be better to user-defined for other prefered services since there are so man out there to choose from. Still, the Roku Streaming Stick+ 4K is awesome.

  If you are new to these types of devices and are trying to decide between Roku and FireTV, just stop right there and get a Roku.  The Roku just works all the time without any hassle.  Every major streaming service is available and Roku makes it easy to sign in and watch.  It connects to wifi just fine and works on every TV I have.  I have several Fire's too because they are cheap, and I thought I could make the switch because I am invested into a lot of Prime stuff.  The Fire's always give me grief with needing to reboot all the time, disconnects from wifi, Netflix locks up in between episodes, and other problems.  Save yourself the aggravation and just get a ROKU.

  Like all products on Amazon, reviews are all over the place on this Roku streaming stick. Some say it was hard to set up, some say they got a faulty unit. I had no issues at all. I opened the box, plugged it in to a HDMI port and connected the power to a USB port. I guess some USB ports don't supply enough power to run a Roku but the Roku will tell you if it has the power to work and my Samsung tv was able to do this. Set up was very simple, just follow the on screen directions. Someone also said the remote would not control a sound bar so I was ready to use a separate remote to control the volume. The remote connected automatically to my TV AND sound bar! My sound bar is an older model and is plugged into the optical  audio out. When I hit the Roku's power button the TV comes on and so does the sound bar. Volume is also supported! Our TV is a  pre 2016 75 inch Samsung smart TV with a lot of apps like Netflix but didn't support YouTube TV which we are going to use after we dump DirectTV which is costing in the $150 range now. It's available on the Roku. I upgraded our router at the same time as ours was getting a little long in the tooth. Bottom line is Roku is easy to set up, simple to navigate and has lots of great features, some of which aren't even listed in the description. On the fence? Buy it!

  Sound is out of sync. Sometimes it seems to be off by a half second or so.A common issue is when an ad starts, the sound becomes extremely loud. (Thought there was a federal statute requiring that sound should remain the same.) When I verbally request music the unit automatically wants to load Pandora. I ask for Prime Music and Roku always loads Pandora. I removed pandora because I have subscriptions to I Heart and Prime. It will actually reload Pandora. Actually my old Roku III hat Amazon as a control button but it was removed and replaced on my Ultra controller. Same issues on my Streaming Stick +es. (Have 2) How about putting Prime back on and maybe putting YouTube TV instead of Sling. YouTube TV is better by the way. Next DirectTV will be buying their way onto Roku’s controller. Last item. Sound. TV sound is required. Remote will not work with add on sound systems. I want to use my 5.1 Visio surround system. Ear buds are better. On/off button is great and volume control good. Need a “mute” button.

  Liked:- 4K/HDR capabilities- excellent remote functionality and layout (controls TV vol and mute)- compact sizeDislike:- can't cast from Windows 10 PC but can from phone. Had no problems with previous Roku 3 and can also cast direct to TV (not through Roku) from Windows 10, so the PC is not the issue.- video quality when casting from my S10+ phone ""seems"" to be less sharp than with my old Roku 3

  This product streams programs well but may not fit well in all TV's depending on how their HDMI sockets are oriented (especially if they are aimed straight out the back of a TV close to a wall).  I had to buy a separate HDMI ""gender bender"" adapter to hook mine up to an existing HDMI (double male) cable, just so it could fit my TV.  Once set up though, it works well and produces an excellent 1080p picture from a variety of streaming sources.  The voice remote works well too, but is limited at finding programs inside some of the separate streaming apps provided by various content providers.  The remote control also lacks a mute button, which seems a clear oversight.

  I wish I had cut the Xfinity cord earlier! Hooked this up in less than a minute.  Downloading my netflix, youtube  and amazon prime took about another 5 minutes. Then added sling blue for $30/month which took about 2 minutes. Bought my own modem for $70.00 instead of the $14/month rental I've been paying comcast for 7 yrs. I still have to use them for internet but my bill went from $160.00/month with no premium channels to $80.00. Streaming quality excellent (was having issues before with netflix and amazon). You will have to adjust to the different format but it's not hard. The voice remote is a dream! I ask it to turn on closed captioning whenever I watch my british shows on PBS lol. I did not expect to get local channels but surprisingly I do here in northern MD. So, don't procrastinate any longer like I did, throwing away $80.00/month! Get this ROKU and then add Sling!

  Have a number of Roku streaming sticks and one Roku TV purchased over the years. Bought the latest for 4K and because my new 75"" 4K Android TV since for some unknown reason is not allowed to run either Amazon Prime Video or the Spectrum/Charter cable app.Setup was easy except that the unit is in two pieces and the wireless is inside a bulge in the power cord and reading the setup instructions is important. That said it has Amazon Prime and Spectrum capability and works about like every other Roku device I have.The reason for degrading a star is that it runs way too hot (too hot to touch and shudder to think about internal temps) so I added a gaggle of 1/2"" square heat sinks using thermally conductive grease and also placed a very small box fan behind the TV to blow on the Roku. This keeps it cool enough to touch.So working well but may need addition cooling for long life.

  I bought this stick to replace a several year old Roku stick that had a laggy interface since year 1.  This is almost the perfect stick.  Very snappy and I swear my 1080P image is much sharper with this stick.  Whereas my old stick was powered by the TV USB, this stick requires more power than my TV USB offers... so have to use the plug-into-socket option.  The only downside is the ROKU stick is always on, which is not bad, except when I'm streaming live You Tube TV and forget to hit <HOME> <Power off> and just hit <Power Off> (which just turns off the TV).  A day later if I've not watched this TV I'll find this stick has been streaming continuously: Bandwidth Hog.  I'm getting better at remembering the turn-off procedure... not so much for my wife and son.

  I have 3 Roku 3800s in my house, and they work great.  I  needed another unit so I decided to get the 3810 since it was on sale. I gave this unit one star, because the unit repeatedly failed to pair with the remote. I went to the Roku blog site and noticed many similar complaints with no resolution. I will be returning this item for a replacement. I will update this review if the replacement works as expected. In the meantime buyer beware.Edit:  After spending some time with Roku's Customer Service via Instant Messenger, it was determined that it was my fault I could not pair my remote.  Due to the extremely short cables that are provided with this product, I substituted their USB mini cable with one that I had on hand. Unfortunately, theirs contains a device ""in line"" which is necessary to operate the Roku, and I unsuspectedly removed it (I thought it was some sort of surge protector for the Roku stick). Do not remove the Roku cable with the USB mini connector!!

  This product does not work as advertised when it comes to audio support.  Video is okay.Do not expect to get dolby atmos out of netflix/amazon and do not expect support.My receiver works fine with LG TV apps and atmos works on all available atmos content, but with roku as input and same titles you only get 5.1, Disney + is the exception, I get Atmos there. Support keeps trying to pass the buck and offers no steps to actually troubleshoot.LG -> Netflix / Amazon/ Disney + -> Receiver = AtmosRoku -> Netflix / Amazon -> Receiver = 5.1 suckRoku -> Disney + = AtmosLogically, the problem is with Roku's compatibility with Netflix/Amazon, but to their support team it is ""receiver fault, netflix fault"".If Atmos is your thing I would look elsewhere.

  It works like other older ROKU devices,  maybe faster.BIG COMPLAINT....it only works with advanced HDMI ports or ARC,  my less than 2 yr old TV doesn't have the ""advanced"" HDMI port,  so have to use the ARC port, which negates using my  soundbar effectively.I cannot use it on  my other two TV's, 5 yrs old, as they have no ""advanced"" HDMI nor an ARC.  There should be some way to bypass that restriction.

  This worked great for our purposes, and vendor was very helpful with small problem we encountered.  Although I am not great with this sort of technology, there was enough help on the screen to get me through the set up.  IMO this is an excellent value.  One small thing:  If I wanted to order an additional remote, I couldn't seem to find enough detail on the roku site to be sure that I was getting the correct remote.  We have two different ones, with MUTE and without.  They look the same except for the mute button on the site of the device, but I could not find enough information to be sure what I was ordering.  Maybe I missed it, but if not, the technical writers at Roku might want to get on this.  Thanks again, basically, good value for the money.

  I got my Roku stick and was excited to set it up; I must have pressed something as the device setup started in French - with no way to go back to change it. I got all the way to what I assumed was pairing to my account. At the same time I also connected to the device from my Roku app. Well, the Roku app said that the stick was associated to another account. Strange as I though I was just setting it up. I would expect that this would simply work and would associate my stick to my account, but oh no. In the end I had to clear all my settings and start from the beginning with reentering my wifi password. This should not happen in 2018. Luckily, I could choose English setup now, but not much better experience in the end. It now keeps saying I didn't confirm that automatic selection of the TV resolution, even though I confirmed it twice. Well third time's a charm. But wait! I again can only link the stick to my device on the web and not on the app. And my previous channels on my old stick are not automatically migrated to this device. WTH? At the end of the registration channel tie-in page - when I press Continue - I get treated with a ""You're signed out..."" message. Why did activation sign me out of roku? Naturally, the device is still waiting for activation... ??? Okay, on second try ""Continue"" did not sign me out... at least be consistent here. Next screen Roku offers me to sign into my existing accounts, e.g. Amazon. But wait, when trying to do that I get ""The website experienced an unexpected problem. Close and reopen your browser..."" Okay, I'll hit Back and skip this instead. Yay, finally I get to ""you're done"" screen and surprise! my existing channels do show up now, yet the website gave no hints and wanted me to add some of these channels again.

  The product works well for a Roku on the go.  It comes with a Mini USB to USB A cable for power.  It's a 2019 device and using a port that is long outdated.  This was a major source of dissatisfaction since I now have to have this cable along when I travel along with a standard Micro USB and USB C.  Even if you aren't using USB - C yet for a device, you should definitely be using Micro USB.I've noticed some issues with connecting to a wireless network at hotels.  It's the same network every time so it's possible it could have stored my credentials (with a room number) and trying to connect off of that each time.  It seems to take a few trying and some messing with it to force it prompt my phone for the network for the hotel signin page.  It could be the network at the hotel though since that has been spotty in the past.I used to use a firestick while travelling but it took forever to get it connected and working on the network.  The Roku stick loads everything much faster and is a much better UI.

  The Roku stick works fine with out an issue but the remote is horrible. The battery is draining like any thing. I am replacing the battery every two months. This is after one year of Using Roku stick.I have changed the battery 4 - 5 times already. Initially I thought the issue is because of the batteries but that is not it I tried different batteries and all has same issue, It works for couple of months and then its dies out . Please refer the photo, Every time there is a discharge from the battery and it looks like some issue with the remote which is shorting or some thing and it dies out. Then I started reading blogs and found Roku already knows this issue and there is no fix for the same. I am not sure why ROKU is knowingly Fooling PPL by selling this Defect remote.I will definitely not recommend this product to Any one, What is the use of having a Roku Stick with a non functional Remote. - So bad.

  I bought this because I don't have an HD receiver in my bedroom and I want to stream sports in HD quality to my HD TV in my bedroom. My family used to be able to watch sports on the one TV in the house with an HD receiver, but we have had family members move in and completely ruin the experience. I have used Chromecast for years, and there have been so many issues with it but it generally worked well enough. But since football season started, I have been especially frustrated with a lack of smooth streaming, and I knew I couldn't go through a whole football season struggling with streaming issues. To top it off, we switched several months ago from slow DSL to a much faster ISP, and we should not be having the same types of streaming issues at all...but we were, at least with respect to Chromecast performance.So, I decided to look up Roku and I was curious about what channel apps were available. I read that any channel that has an app would be available on Roku, so that was good enough for me and I purchased it. It has worked great...very few streaming issues at all, and the little bit that exist clear up pretty fast and then you have a smooth streaming experience.A few problems, though, most of which have been fixed/worked around at this time:1) The BTN2Go app does not play live TV. It says, ""This video is currently unavailable. Please check back later"" every time. Thankfully, you can watch the Big Ten Network through the Fox Sports app.2) It takes a little too long for each app to start up. This is pretty annoying when you're trying to flip back and forth between various games.3) Roku does not, in fact, have every app associated with streaming live TV. If you want to watch CBS and CBS Sports Network games, it's pretty hard to do so because Roku does not have the actual CBS Sports app. They have this crappy, worthless CBS Sports HQ app that does not show any games, and they have the CBS app that expects you to pay monthly to stream CBS programming. Yet, the CBS Sports app and the CBS Sports site both let you stream SEC games and games on CBS Sports Network (usually AAC and military academy games) for free. I spent hours on Saturday trying to figure out how I can get around this issue and finally figured out how to mirror my laptop screen to Roku. But I really had to dig around online for this info. I really would rather not have to mirror my laptop at all for games; I'd like the real CBS Sports app to be available on Roku.4) It's pretty annoying how every time you want to use an app for the first time that requires your TV cable subscription info, you have to go to your phone or PC/laptop and go to some link to get access.5) I did have an issue with the Roku connecting and disconnecting repeatedly when I first hooked it up and went through set up. Once I reset the stick, unplugged it and plugged it back in and went through setup again, this issue was resolved.--After getting these issues figured out, except for the slow app load times, there's nothing wrong with Roku at all--it's the best $60 or $70 you'll ever spend. Great video quality and great performance. It has saved my football season, and probably my basketball, tennis, softball, etc, seasons, as well. It works so well that it's easy to leave it on and stream up my internet bandwidth usage because I forget it's not the actual cable. It just streams seamlessly.

  So great, so great, so great.  What was I thinking all these years?  Here's the deal: A lot of these cord-cutting options don't really pan out, because you have to pay $40/mo for YouTube or the other big ones.  What's the point, then?  you save some, for sure, but... it's never seemed worth it, to me.  But now there's Philo TV, which has ALL the channels I watch - no other service does, under $25/mo.  Philo is $16.  !!!  Awesome!  And it has Comedy Channel, History, DIY, FYI, and HGTV.  If you have Amazon Prime, you get PBS Masterpiece!  Through in another $5/mo and you get all of PBS, as a subscriber - and it's a tax deduction.As for Roku Streaming Stick+... I like it much better than the Fire Stick.  It's just more fun, and you can change the ""theme"" for free now.  Easy to use, and the remote has Voice Commands!!  Awesome!  It instantly learns how to control the volume and Power for your TV, too.  Now you're down to one remote.  My only gripe would be it would be REALLY nice to have a backlight on the remote.  But that's a minor thing.  Still... it would be nice.Picture quality is excellent.  Programs never pause.  The interface seems pretty fast.  You do have to wait sometimes when going between shows, but look at it this way; it's a lot quicker than sitting through even one short commercial.One other thing that takes getting used to - in a good way - is you don't really need to ""tape"" anything.  you just say what program you like to watch, and it ""saves"" all upcoming episodes for you.  They're not ""recording"" anything except a link to the program you want to watch.

  After watching video reviews of the Roku products, I selected this one.  It was so easy to install and takes up no space.  The USB port of my tv provided enough power and I did not need to use an extension.  Picture quality is excellent and I can watch so many programs that it will take a long time to decide on favorites.  Also, since I subscribe to Prime, Britbox and Acorn services already, I can now watch these in the bedroom.  Cost was extremely reasonable.

  I have four Roku TVs - that means the Roku App is built into the TV from the factory. I also have a Roku Streaming Stick+ on a dumb TV, and I have just added a new Streaming Stick+ to my smart Samsung TV.  None of these devices have cost one cent to access and watch anything from Roku.  The reviewers that say they are being charged are probably not talking to ROKU. They are being scammed.The only thing that a subscriber has to pay for, after buying the Roku device, is a subscription to a premium content network provider, such as Netflix.  As to the Streaming stick+  - it works great on my smart TV and delivers 4K images if the channel is sending 4K images.

  I brought my rating from 4 to 3.My main criticism concerns the remote. It has only very limited functions and there is no performant alternative to be found on Amazon or elsewhere. For $25 Sideclick can add a few functions, but it still is incomplete.The shortcut keys are useless to me since I don't watch the Hulu, Sling and Netflix imposed shortcuts. I do watch Amazon Prime, but there is no shortcut key for that, nor is there any possibility to reprogram the imposed keys. I deplore the inexistence of any user programmable keys altogether, which exist in higher end Roku models. Therefore, the Roku remote cannot take control of the TV sleep function or the image and sound settings. Neither does it allow to mute the sound, if you can believe that. I have no alternative than to juggle with 2 remotes.Technically, the remote doesn't work well. It often becomes unresponsive while the batteries are still good. When this happens, I can wait a minute or two, and if this isn't enough, take the batteries out and back in,  turn the TV off, and if this still doesn't work, unplug the stick, reset the router... It happens more and more often - at least once every hour when I zap between channels.Finally, there are buffering problems and frequent sound-image coordination problems, which do not exist on my Roku Ultra.This stick wasn't the great buy I initially thought.

  I got this after verifying that Roku would do everything that I hoped. I first got an Ultra 2020 then after testing this model got a couple more just like it from a local store. It surprised me how well it worked and how convenient it is. The number of free viewing options is unbelievable and the way it manages both free and paid streaming services was simply incredible.  I feel a sorry for the satellite services. Every time I show this solution to a friend they too cancel their satellite service, get a streaming service at less than half the cost, and use the first month's saving to buy a Roku to manage it all. Only wish I had done this years ago as I am now saving $115 a month.

  This has been one of the best purchases I've made. So I got a few roku sticks because our whole family basically streams from a few streaming services, but we also have cable and can use our cables app to stream instead of having their box which costs extra just to have it. It was definitely worth the buy! I've had other streaming sticks or devices and nothing honestly compares to Roku. I love how you can organize your streaming apps on the homepage and can also set parental controls for certain devices, like my son's room. I also like how there are many free streaming options and just about every streaming app out there for whatever your needs are. It's simple to use that even my 65 yr old mother can use it with ease. Worth the purchase, if your thinking about getting it, then get it. You will not be disappointed.

  A nice inexpensive Firestick. The Home page is completely different but I'm getting used to it. It works well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm so used to the other Firesticks layout and I don't like change LOL. Good product at a reasonable price, I got mine when it was less than $18. Basically all the same features.

  This firestick is wonderful. I purchase 2 before Christmas. There no TV controls, but still is an upgrade from my 3 year firestick that kept shutting off.

  This Fire Stick is much faster than my original 1st generation one. I do like the Alexa involvement although it’s not 100% accurate in the requests. The fact that volume is not controlled by this version provides no problem. I’m so used to using the DISH control for that, I’d probably not use voice control on a Fire Stick anyway.

  It’s great! We purchased it for our daughters room and they love the access to Netflix, Disney, and a bunch of other apps. It’s very easy for my 6 year old to use on her own. It’s easy to use from tv to tv.  I’ll end up getting a second one for our main tv since it is unable to update and get the latest apps. Definitely an awesome option!

  I know it isn't a new product but considering the fire stick just got updated, I'm very pleased with its performance.

Tremendous value too.

  I noticed that this streaming stick seems to be somewhat sluggish when it comes to menu updates and navigation.  This isn't an issue that I've found using the Roku streaming stick on another TV around the same price.Also, the ads for new Amazon shows on the home screen are kinda annoying. Other than that, it works fine.

  I use my Firestick to escape the crap on the regular TV channels such as GMA selling junk within their program (along with advertising along side the program). As I said above almost everything you want to watch must be paid for, you must be selective or you will be spending a chunk of change!  I am not sure promotional information for Fire Stick makes this clear. One thing that irks me is the storyline description is not complete for programs on Amazon Prime: the storyline ends with a small rectangle with three dots as though I can click on something or push a button on the Firestick remote in order to see the remaining storyline description, but forget about that! Iguess a person must resign to the fact that there is no free lunch - everything has a cost.

  2 cons. Have to unplug and replug it in to the t.v. 2-3 times weekly because the sound to the t.v /soundbar stops. Apparently, a common problem with this firestick, when Google, and this is the only fix i have found.2nd MAJOR PROBLEM!!!! While it is plugged into any t.v. in the house, it picks up any pictures you have saved to Amazon Photos and on your phone and plays them on the t.v s at random as screen savers. Not good when you have pics that you may not want everyone to see. Called Amazon and they said there is no way to disable that function, only to get rid of Amazon photos completely...

  I am a Tivo user and when HBO Max took over for HBO Go  - I was not able to stream HBO - although I pay for it through Verizon.  I do not need a Verizon box with my Tivo - so rather than pay for an unnecessary and costly verizon fios box  - this firestick lite is the perfect answer.  Its so easy to use and HBO Max is included!!

  Got this for my guest room as a cheaper alternative to purchasing another appleTV.The bad: The user interface is unbelievably bad for such a major brand product and is clearly designed to benefit the advertisers, not the end user. Several of the apps (including Twitch, which they own) crash almost constantly. The remote is not particularly responsive.The good: mostly does what it is advertised to do, which is pretty decent for how cheap it is. Very easy to set up and sync with services. The remote, while not particularly great, is at least simple and easy to use.Overall, can’t say I would really recommend it, but if you’re looking for a cheaper alternative that won’t be used all the time then it’s still a decent choice.

  I previously bought a Fire TV Stick and loved it so much ! During the Black Friday weekend sale I noticed it was on sale for almost half price so I bought another one only to find out after ( I didn’t do any homework) it wasn’t the same, the Lite means it doesn’t control your TV ,so you have to use two different remotes to power up the TV ! Other than that everything else works the same as far as I know. In my opinion I would of rather of paid full price for the regular Fire Stick, it’s worth it for the extra convenience!

  Basically I bought it because it was on sale, we'd lost the remote to the old one and ours was getting a bit dated. Works great. Was supposed to be ""pre setup"" with my Amazon account. I don't think this happened because I had to do all the setup in the quick start guide. Works just like the old one, slightly faster and less glitch prone.

  Don’t be diswayed by the Lite, it is a full functional, normal storage fire stick. It just doesn’t have the volume or power button, which many of us don’t need as we probably have a dozen other remote options:tv, cable, sound bar. I love the fire stick and am happy there is a version i don’t have to pay extra for button features I wouldn’t even use most of the time.

  I bought this for my second smart tv that I was gifted recently. It works perfect with the TV. It was easy to set up, even while having one already on my main TV in the house.The only thing I would recommend is for the option to choose which power cable you want to receive, instead of having to buy a separate attachment to be able to power it with just the tv and not the wall power outlet.

  Very easy to set up.  Even includes the batteries.  Good bang for the buck, I guess.  BUT, like every other Amazon product that streams movies, etc., they're built to deteriorate/die after a few years.  It kind of forces you to buy another one lest you have other options.  Guess that's just another reason Bezos is the richest person in THE WORLD.

  Love it. Simply made my life easier. It was super cheat and a great product. If you are willing and able, spend some extra bucks to be able to control volume and tv power all in one remote. But if you are like me, who does not care much about having two remotes and prefers a cheap product that has great feature, this is it for you.

  I bought this to upgrade my old fire TV stick.  It is a great improvement over the old stick.  No more broken up in streaming with better preview feature.  Very happy with this deal as I have to throw the old one away.  I bought the lite version because the TV control part is incomplete as that only controls power and sound.

  I got this for my Vizio “Smart” TV that wouldn’t play movies for Netflix and Hulu despite having the installed app on the TV. EVERYTIME I would select the app for those they would start to stream the movie I would pick and return with a code that would say it was unable to play movie. I had written to Vizio without any response. Finally after some searching in the internet for solutions, it came back with a cheap solution for a dongle. I picked this one because with the Chromecast you had to use your phone to stream it. This Roku comes with a remote that works for your tv and even has voice search. It installed over 130 channels with more to select from.  I have tried Netflix and Hulu and HBOGO and it plays every movie I select with no problems. I am so satisfied with this. I have even heard it will work on other TVs that aren’t smart and will turn them into a smart tv. This is a great cheap device and works great. Sound and video looks great.

  The ""Point Anywhere Remote"" is probably the worst remote I've ever had. From day one it was a problem getting it to pair and work. It would work fine and then suddenly you would have to get the remote within about 10 inches of the roku stick to get it to start working again. Then you could walk away. Now it wont work at all when you walk away. The effective range of the remote with fresh batteries, and a full factory reset is about 6 inches if you're lucky. It will not work at all beyond 6 inches. Have ordered the free hdmi extender that they offer, and we'll see if that works. But quite frankly I'm not sure why thats not something thats included if its a problem enough for them to offer it in the troubleshooting video.

  I purchased the Roku to add a few more streaming options like YouTube. I also have a Fire TV that I purchased 4 years ago. What I liked right away was that the Roku remote also controlled the volume on the TV. Just need the one remote, big plus. The setup was easy, added a few apps too. The first thing I noticed was the picture quality. When I went through the setup, I let the device do the automatic setup. The edges are not crisp. Comparing the same video between the Fire TV and the Roku, the Fire TV has a much clearer and crisper image. I went into the TV setting and reset to the default, no improvement. It is more noticeable with text. The lines are not clean, kind of zigzag with a haziness around them. Just like if you enlarge an image and it starts to get pixelated. I tried adjusting the settings on the roku. No help. Problem #2. If I use the Fire TV or Blu-ray player and then use the Roku. The Roku remote will not work. I have to pop out a battery from the Roku remote and put it back in for the remote to work. Disappointing.I thought this was going to replace my Fire TV, but no. I can't get past the poor image quality.

  I've had many Rokus for a good number of years, but needed 2 of them to put behind tvs without having a cable hanging down. This is why we I purchased 2 sticks.Plugging this device into the USB on the back of a TV (or any powersource that isn't always on like a switched outlet) causes the batteries in the remote to run dry in less than a week (without even being used!)While this is an engineering flaw that could probably be sorted out with a firmware update, my low review comes from Roku choosing to ignore this issue for years, and continuing to give its customers the runaround. They haven't owned the issue or worked on a fix...instead just directing customers to simply plug the USB into a power outlet instead of their TV.If you're planning on plugging this device into the USB power on the back of your TV, and aren't 100% that your USB stays powered when your TV is off...then best to find a different solution than this.Roku wants this device to always be on...that way it can monitor your entire network and sell the information advertisers...so don't expect a fix for this!

  I had the Roku Premiere in my Family room but my router is upstairs so it kept losing connection throughout the day so I purchaser the Roku® Streaming Stick®+ which works great and it has been staying connected. I've had it for 10 days but today it went offline so I thought it would go back online shortly but it didn't so realized that they end of USB Power Cable with Advanced Wireless Receiver end that plugs into the streaming stick doesn't fit as tight at it should. I had to put tape around it to make it fit tight and now it seems to be staying connected. I am very disappointed about this part of it because I just purchased it and now it's loose. I also purchased one for my daughter's bedroom because her Roku 3 was staying connected and now the Roku® Streaming Stick®+ works great in her bedroom.

  Setup is super simple, 4k picture is stellar (if programming is captured in 4k) and the fact that this eliminates another dust catcher is a plus.A secret bonus is that this is small enough it can be taken on vacation.  Most hotels already offer free WiFi along with an HDMI capable TV.  No longer are you limited to the few channels available, nor do you have to touch that icky hotel remote. Just don't leave it behind!

  I finally broke down and upgraded my Roku 2 after being informed that it was no longer going to be updated. OMG! It’s so amazing! Transforms my 10 yr old HD TV into a viewing pleasure. The speed, the clarity, being able to use my iPhone/iPad as a remote and speaker! So I ordered another Roku for my senior dad who can now plug in his headphones into his iPad to hear the TV vs blasting it to the point the walls shake.

  Overall I'm happy with this product. Had some issues with wifi on my smart TV that I bought for cheap (it's an LG, but I guess you get what you pay for if you're going cheap) so the Roku was a much cheaper alternative to fixing it or buying a new TV. The remote is simple and works great, I wish it was lighted so I can operate it in the dark (I use this in my bedroom) and the interface, though not great, is very functional. The voice search is a nice feature but the integration with Alexa is not simple enough and we ended up not using it that much. Wifi reception and streaming quality is very good, although I tried to check my internet connection via Roku the other day and it said the connection was slow, but I was able to stream HD content with no issues. So not sure what the test does, but it seems to be testing something else that doesn't have to do with streaming.

  This is my 4th or more Roku. all worked fine and then stopped. This lst one is voice activated which is excellent. I tried a very simple request to Roku for being able to return all my failed sticks and remotes, to see if any could be rescued. I wasnt looking for any refund or even warranty replacements. Other than acknowledging my contact, nothing more. A good product with poor support

  Roku streaming stick + is the best streaming stick you can buy. The Wifi range pickup on this Roku is amazing. We have it in our master bedroom a ways from the internet in the center of the house. It has never had any problem streaming high quality video and im only running 20mbs internet. Our tv can power the stick via USB but the cord is long enough to reach your outlet/surge proctor if you need it too. I also have a Roku Premiere + and the streaming and menus run just as quick. Great product any app you would need only downside is no internet browsing application but today we can get on the internet on anything so no issue for me. GREAT PRODUCT!

  I had very high hopes for this device, and tested it in two distinctly different environments: one where it was two rooms away from the router, and in a different house where the device was only seven or eight feet away from a good router signal. The result was about the same: inconsistent signal retention at best. Frustrating.

  As mentioned above the voice control to select what you want to view does not work!  To get what you want, you have to repeat your selection numerous times or simply go and type in your selection!  I preciously complained about this item, and was contacted by your rep, and she said she was forwarding the complaint, which was verified in real time, and that I would be further contacted by your tech dept., but no one ever contacted me to resolve the problem!!!  Very, very  poor customer service by Amazon!!!

  I’m not going to lie. I’ve always been a roku fan. I only got the firestick because I wanted to get it “unlocked” to see what the hype was about. It’s pretty good but there are still some movies and shows that won’t play or episodes may play a previous season so I have to keep going over the links. Now I won’t be trading all of my rokus because fire sticks are more complicated for my 6 year old to use especially since he’s used to roku but I use it in my living room for movie nights.

  What I like about this product is the speed, the latest model even at the lowest price point is still very fast. Easy to figure out, like Roku I use of course Amazon, Spotify, IMDB, and off and on Netflix and Hulu.I would like this item to be more energy efficient, when plugging the USB cable into the television it said low power, so I needed to use a wall plug.The benefit of the device is that with the smart tv the apps might not be updateable, sort of like an old operating system. With the Fire Stick at about thirty dollars, recycle and get a new one, get a tv/monitor with good sound or image, not connectivity, now my tv needs to update no thank you.

  This was a gift. I really knew nothing about it. It took a little while for me to figure out that I had to change my TV input setting from cable to HDM-1. I think that's missing in the instructions. Customer service helped me over that hurdle, & then all was good. I haven't used it much yet, but I expect to use it a lot!

  What a great product! So simple to set up and at $17.99 a colossal bargain!We’ve been using the original Fire TV Stick and this is superior in every way. Alexa can get a little dodgy at times but not bad at all and what a joy to be able to just ask for your programs instead of scrolling through a bunch of screens.

  In all honesty, I got it to use as a streaming device for my projector also, I'm able to connect it to my echo dot. Got the fire stick to plug into my projector which has an HDMI port, also I'm able to power through the projector using the USB port.The volume on my projector is trash, so I use my echo dot as my speaker.The volume control sucks on this because the remote doesn't have buttons to control volume. It's okay though because I just leave the echo next to me and I'm able to control it that way. I have not tried asking Alexa to open apps using the echo but im pretty sure you can. I recommend buying this.

  While watching Hulu after a few minutes it freezes up.  You can back out by hitting the home button, force stopping it through settings doesn't seem to help.  It does force Hulu to reload, but as soon as you pick something it locks up again, not even waiting a few minutes.  I was hoping this was already addressed with a software update, but checking for updates didn't show anything new.  Perhaps it will be fixed in the future, but for now its a 3 star device since Hulu is a major use app for it.

  I seem to have to reset the remote control almost every time I use it. Plugged directly into the TV. When I turn the TV in it is instantly there. However when I push ANY button including home, it does nothing. I have to push the reset on the Roku unit EVERY TIME, then wait for it to reboot. Then it works fine. I do watch 4K Blu-ray’s and then switch back to Roku. Even then I still have to reboot the Roku. Other than single pain in the neck I’m pretty happy with the unit. If I could get the reboot every time to stop I would rate it higher. Great looking picture. My internet speed is outstandingly high, so when I decide what I want to watch it starts almost instantly!

  I like how smooth it works. It loads programs fast with very little buffering even with my VPN on. I have 25 mbs internet speed. First, it doesn’t have Google Store which is a bummer. Second, when I try to install a program and I try to highlight the install, I have to guess because it doesn’t highlight anything. This fire stick light is a big disappointment.

  This seems to be a great streaming stick, minus the fact that Amazon forced Roku onto removing Twitch and all 3rd party Twitch apps. I feel bad giving it less than 5 stars because it's not roku's fault that Amazon is being greedy and wanting to force people's hands into buying a fire TV if they want to watch twitch, but I felt it was necessary to let people know in the reviews. Besides the lack of any twitch support, this streaming stick is great, and I would recommend it over the fire TV as long as you don't need the twitch app.

  I have one with every TV in our house! Had two and just got our third. We bought a smart TV and it’s UI is just terrible. The smart TV is slow/laggy/disconnects, all terrible and we didn’t know what to do for the longest time. Then light bulb went off to also try Roku, and ta-da... works PERFECT. Thank you Roku for fixing a what a thousand $ Smart TV couldn’t do.We have the Roku app on our phones so it easily switches between all our devices and is way better than the remote it comes with in my opinion. For some reason, the remote batteries on the Roku remote drain so fast for us... so opt into the App and you’ll love it even more!

  My husband has been using a Roku streaming stick for several years, while I've been using an older, early version Amazon Fire Stick. Awhile back, I decided to try the Roku -- and he gave me one as a Christmas gift.While I've definitely enjoyed using my new Roku, my biggest complaint (and why I couldn't give it 5 stars) is the location of the off/on sound button. As I'm right-handed, I tend to hold the control in my right hand, switching channels with my right index finger. Since the sound controls are located on the outside of the unit on the right side, I find I'm constantly turning off the sound because my hand is inadvertently squeezing the button.Can you say ... annoying?Other than than, I'm enjoying the opportunity to expand my TV viewing ... and trying to use my left hand to control my new streaming stick.

  I had absolutely no problem setting these up. I Didn't have the youtube tv app on my tv and couldn't download it so I bought 2 of these sticks. There is much more than I expected as far a free channels.  I find myself watching old tv shows quite a bit.  A lot of content. Some good some bad. I think anyone could find things they like though. A feature I like is from the app on your android or Iphone you can turn on headphones for late night and not bother others who are trying to sleep. If I had known they had so much free content to offer I would have bought one of these a long time ago. Great  company, great product. My experience dealing with Roku was easy and pleasant. I sent an email requesting HDMI extender cables, received a confirmation follow up almost immediately that they would send them. A few days later they were here.

  I like this better than my old roku device. i owned a roku premiere. Dont get me wrong both devices were awesome i just didnt checked the wifi features of my Roku Premiere because it only supports 802.11bgn. It still load fast enough in streaming, my only issue is that i cant maximize my internet which is 5G connection. And this Roku Streaming Stick+ supports it. Its 802.11ac MIMO dual-band wireless so it loads much faster and better on 4k video streaming. So Roku Rocks!!

  I specifically bought this to use as a remote with my TV.  I have a Sony, and yet it is not compatible with this Roku, so it's not doing what I bought it to do.  Is understand if had some random no name brand, but it's a Sony for crying out loud.  I already had another Roku which worked just fine.  That said, it works well as a streaming stick.  One thing I'd like to see, is a way to reprogram the preset buttons, so that it would go to the apps I use most.  My old stick has an Amazon button, but this has ESPN.  I only use one of the four preset buttons.

  It's a little stronger than the one it replaced. Easy installation and it brings in  YouTubeTV, which is a big set of channels. Very satisfied.I've had these two streaming sticks (plus) for almost two years -- one in the bedroom and the other in the living room. Oh, and  a third in the basement. Almost forgot that one. The router is in a different room down the hall from ALL the rooms. Yes, there are problems, but the problems are mostly the result of glitchy service from Charter/Spectrum. Now, with COVID and everyone at home -- apparently permanently -- they don't have enough servers to manage the number of customers online all the time. Also, change batteries when the remotes get wonky. I have a lot of high quality (Panasonic Eneloop) batteries rechargeables and at least I know I'm not adding more poison to local dumps. You can bury the batteries on Amazon and they really ARE the best by far. Buy rechargeable batteries and change your batteries before they go completely dead because while they are dying, they get very intermittent and weird. If you have any doubt, change the batteries.

  We just ordered a second for the living room because I'm loving the one in my bedroom so much. Both rooms have Samsung Smart TVs and they really aren't smart. On our Samsungs the operating software and all the apps lag, they never seem to stream the newest apps, streaming quality sucks, etc etc, so I turned to Roku for a solution. TV is now perfect! I no longer use the smart features on my tv and now rely entirely on my super-fast, high-quality stream, easy to use Roku for everything! I also now have more content and channels than I'll ever know what to do with! Let's let the TV be what it is and Roku be the master for all things streaming! Perfect solution!!!!

  I purchased this as a replacement for my old Firestick which was showing its age. It has proven to be much faster than the old one. However, it has one problem and that is it will sometimes go to sleep and can only be waked by unplugging the power supply and then replugging it. This is annoying.  I hope this doesn’t indicate a problem which will get worse in time.

  I got this to replace a two year old Roku Express . That unit was overheating where it was mounted under the tv, so we thought the stick would perform better and it was a good call.Super easy set up. Streaming speed is excellent, but my wireless modem is right underneath it. I did wish that the USB power cord would have sufficed, but the power coming out of that TV port was not sufficient. You can get them to ship you a hdmi extender for free if your port won't fit the stick( it's about 5 inches long I would reckon) best of all it came with a remote that automatically linked to my smart tv, so it controls power/ volume etc.Defintely worth the price.

  We love this except for the problem we (an several others) experience when watching YouTube TV. It will go to the ads and then when the ads are over, it freezes and will not come back. Lately even when going completely out and going back in, it will not allow me to finish watching the program that I was watching. One day will be fine, then will go off for three or more day in a row.BTW, Amazon will not allow you to purchase more than three devices. No idea why not. I had to order from elsewhere for the rest of my TV's.

  I needed to find a replacement for the streaming applications that I had been using through my Blu-Ray player. Wanted something that would allow for the software to be updated. The software in my Blu-Ray player was very rarely updated and while it worked the newer versions of the the Hulu, Netflix, and Prime apps available via the Roku Streaming Stick+ were very welcome. Software starts up much quicker than with the previous Blu-Ray player apps. Works well enough that I bought the 4k Ultra box for the TV in the living room to replace the Fire Stick. So far very happy with the performance of both this Streaming Stick+ and the 4k Ultra Box. The box is faster than the stick. Considering moving this stick to the guest room and putting a 4k Ultra Box in the bedroom to replace it. Even if I don't this stick works great. Thoroughly enjoying it.

  Stick has been working great for a while, but recent updates have some apps suddenly rebooting and sometimes requires rebooting the stick. Not sure if these issues are specific to the apps or the stick.Overall a great buy for cord cutters - you can access things like Amazon video, which aren't accessible through Chromecast. Biggest drawbacks are the dated interface and inability to sync app authorizations across multiple Roku devices, the latter scenario requires you to authorize each app on each Roku device.One recommendation for Roku and other buyers - if you're putting this in a rear HDMI port on a wall mounted TV you'll need to purchase a separate, flexible HDMI extension so the stick can hang down flat against the wall.Update @ 1 Year:We've had a lot of issues with the audio going out of sync and the video automatically zooming in making shows unwatchable. Seems to only happen on the Hulu app, but that is one we use heavily in our household. I imagine that's a software issue, but I have to put it on Roku to get it fixed.Never had these problems with our other two, older Rokus.

  I bought this for my mom, for Christmas.  She loves it! We got it plugged in,  and logged in to all of her subscriptions,  and it works great. We were especially happy with the voice search, which works extremely well!I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that you can use your tv's usb port to power it! That saves a lot of trouble when your surge protector is full.

  I have Samsung smart TV and Amazon Fire Stick and TiVo and I've used all as an Operating System (OS) for my TV for streaming content from Netflix, Amazon Prime and PBS passport. The Roku OS is by far the best.1. it plugs into HDMI port on any TV and powers via the USB cable that also plugs into TV. So I can move it from bedroom TV to family room TV. Heck I could use in any hotel room.2. it uses 5 GHz wifi band for connecting to my wifi. I wanted that vs lower speed 2.4 GHz band3. has voice control. I use it for search. e.g., ""Pixar movies"". Then it shows me which streaming services have the Pixar movies (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Prime, ...) and I jump directly into that service to watch that movie.The Roku OS and interface updates often, so I'll get latest available. Better than using Smart TV OS, or streaming services via DVD or other devices.

  DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I have 3 Amazon Fire TV sticks so I decided to give Roku a try to see if it’s better. What a horrible waste of my $50. Roku is not user-friendly at all. It is hard to hook up because you have to pair it with the TV. Navigating is a pain because it’s confusing. And most of all, it suddenly decided to stop working. So I called Customer Service but got none because of the pandemic. I don’t see why Roku doesn’t have IT people work from home. I have had no trouble at all with Amazon’s Fire Sticks.

  When I tried to set this up, for some reason, it would not connect....said the account was locked.  When I contacted the phone number on the screen, it was from a company called WINSOC IT.  They said they were the official third party biller for Roku.  The phone number was 855-256-4555.  It is a SCAM!  Go to roku.com for help.  The website showed up as official-roku.com....they tried to explain it as a “registration” charge and was new billing as of October.  Nothing shows up on roku website.Great product, great streaming, but be careful when activating....

  Worked great except it has to be plugged in to power and didn't work on USB to tv which in my case required a USB extension cord.  Don't use it without starting with the power cord and do use USB plug it comes with.  Great picture quality and sound and no lag or breaks in reception. Used an extension you can get for free from roku that drops it lower behind the tv to increase communication w the remote. The mute button on the remote is poorly placed as you hit it easily whenever using it for any of the face buttons. Should be on face. All other operations work well. Hated that it didn't have a choice of movie screening apps for one button access. Not as easy to set up as expected unless you do it exactly right at first try and don't have to start over...

  This is one of those pieces of tech that works well out of the box. I set it up in a few minutes and was easily able to pair with my harmony universal remote. The remote it comes with is very simple and works well; added bonus it automatically recognizes the TV so the volume and power buttons work without programming. I needed something for HBO max and Disney plus mostly as my tivo doesn't have that option, but will certainly try for other services and will probably try apple+ since there is a 3 month trial offered. All in all great product and glad I did some research before settling on this one.

  I love the Roku interface.  It's simple and straight to the point which I appreciate.My main complaint though would be the voice remote.  It is poorly designed and for me completely useless.  If you want to find out if a certain movie is streaming on one of your installed apps, ROKU's voice function will not help you with that.  It will only take you to where you can rent or buy the searched for movie.  It does not help you search for anything.  It is only there to help roku make money.Amazon's fire stick & Apple TV's voice remotes work as expected.  They show you which streaming service has what you are looking for as well as other excellent search functions.

  Lot of free movies(old), some free news channels and lot of free streaming apps. The stick is a very slick and compact. Works with the power from TV's USB. It's 4k but I use it with 1080p TV and video and sound quality is excellent. As long as apps continue to provide updates and support this device, I will have no regrets. Roku customer support is good. Few things that don't work well:1. Inbuilt screen mirroring to mirror videos from windows laptop or iPhone does not work well.2. The remote is not very good. Needs new batteries every 2 months.3. Sometimes the home screen does not respond to remote button press during start-up. After couple of retries, it works and continues to work normally thereafter.

  I got this for my mother for Christmas. She isn't very techy but recently learned about streaming, so I wanted her to have an easy way to browse for shows (without needing to call me every time). If she can't figure it out with this, she just can't figure it out!There's buttons on the remote for Hulu, Disney, Netflix and Roku, voice commands, home button, back button. And on the home screen there is a ""free"" section where she can browse for things to watch that are included in my subscriptions. It also allowed me to customize the channels shown on her home page, which let me remove anything she didn't need and add things I thought she'd use. She was super excited!

  My first experience with Roku was on a TCL TV, I was amazed at how easy it was to navigate and how well it works.  I bought my first Streaming Stick + to use with our projector, which we usually use in the backyard.  Previously we had either used a laptop connected by HDMI or a Chromecast, this is a much easier and better option.We have an older AppleTV and I think these are easier to use and have almost as many apps available.  With the latest update you can now use Airplay with these as well.  The only thing you lose is the ability to watch content you purchased on iTunes, which isn’t that much for us.  For the price these simply cannot be beat!

  DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO USE THE REMOTES!We bought 2 Streaming Stick+ on Black Friday. We don't watch more than 20 hours of TV a week on 2 TVs. We are now at our 3rd set of batteries in each remote. I hardly had to replace the batteries in the old remotes. Thankfully I'm sending this back within the return window. I will just go back to the older Roku sticks till I find a better replacement.

  This is the 3rd Roku Streaming device that I have purchased and I have been happy with all three. Very easy setup and I was watching within minutes.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the extra channel buttons on the remote control. Apparently, the extra channel buttons at the bottom of the remote (Netflix, SlingTV, Directv, etc.) are RANDOMLY different. I was expecting to get the remote shown in the picture with Netflix, SlingTV, Directv and Hulu buttons but, instead of a Hulu button, I got an ESPN button (ew, yuck!) I hate sports of any kind and would rather die than watch any type of sports channel. So, having an ESPN button on my Roku remote is just a waste of space. Plus, it just annoys me to have to look at it.

  I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a weak router.  It picks up the WiFi signal (incl 5Ghz band) and streams smoothly.  Note that several other Roku products don't support 5Ghz, and if you live near other people, old 2.4Ghz band can get congested and flaky.  This one advertises it's more sensitive WiFi antenna and that seems to be a valid claim based on what I can see.Otherwise, it is a Roku, which is a fine, no subscription, and low cost alternative to AppleTV or other similar TV and streaming devices. A little heavy on the ads (unobtrusive mostly, and only when you're picking a service, doesn't affect the streaming content in any way).

  I had two of these, one a present, one I purchased. One stopped at 5 months the other stopped at 5 1/2. This seems to be a common problem with these. They were very warm to the touch when in use. Most likely the heat is causing an early breakdown. I tried looking into warranty or service, without help. I do think it is poorly engineered, and the company knows it.It worked fine for us when it was new, but the short life made it a poor choice.Updated 5-12-19, I did get both devices working again, after restarting internet connection, the router and going thru the entire setup for the Roku stick again. Now both work fine. Why the last restart worked, but others did not, is a mystery to me. I changed my rating from the 1 star to 3 because of this.

  Overall, Im happy with this product. The one gripe I have is that Roku doesnt include an HDMI adapter for these streaming sticks.  The Roku stick is long and most newer TVs have this concaved back where the HDMI inputs are.  So this Roku stick will not plug in and fit properly.  You need an HDMI adapter/extender.  The manual states that you can order it for free and it arrives within a few days.  But why is it NOT INCLUDED to begin with?  Also, the part that they provided does not even work.  I dont know if it fails to convert HDCP 2.2 through the extender, but the Roku stick would not get detected by my TV as an HDMI source.  I created my own extender using a regular HDMI cable and attached an HDMI coupler to it, and that worked well.  This is the reason why I gave it 4 stars.  If Roku addresses this, it would have been 5 stars easily.

  Very simple, basic, inexpensive version. Useful if, like me, you want to add another unit cheaply to a very small TV in a room you only watch in sporadically. In that case, the picture not being HD isn’t very noticeable and if the volume has to be controlled by the TV remote, so what? Perfect price pint for what it is.

  So I bought all 3 versions of the fire sticks. The light, for stick and the ultra.Regarding the lite version it’s just as good as the other ones except it doesn’t have the control that also controls the TV. The new controller. That’s really the only difference I noticed. I use this for my daughter’s room. Works well

  for Prime members, of course. It has been a few years since my 1st gen Fire TV. It offers the same look and easy navigation but much snappier performance.  Wi-Fi connection is more stable and reliable. Remote control works as it should be. This device will simply turn your older TVs (with HDMI input) into smart TVs.

  As long as your cognizant of the fact (and it's not like they are hiding it) that it doesn't control the TV this is a little hidden gem.The difference in speed/performance between this ""lite"" version and my non-4k fire stick is not even comparable.

  This product has worked very well for my family. I love the parental controls to keep my kids from being able to open apps or make purchases without my permission. It’s very user friendly, my six year old is already a pro. You can’t control the volume of the tv with the fire stick remote on this model, which for me is not an issue at all, but if that does matter to you I would consider going with the regular fire stick and not the lite. Alexa seems to have great voice recognition again, my six year old can use this function with no issue to have her play music and open apps. Overall a great purchase and you can’t beat it for the price

  I wanted to love my fire tv stick, and when I first installed it I was impressed.  About every other day it will simply freeze, requiring that I disconnect power, and then restart it.  I returned the original to Amazon, thinking it was a fluke.  The replacement unit they sent me does the same thing.  I spent an hour on the phone with tech support, and they could not  get it working reliably.Its a nice idea, but buggy.

  Not a good start.  The ""UP"" direction on the 4-way rocker switch was bad upon arrival so they're sending me an entirely new stick and remote.  I also noticed that when I came back to the device after a 12-hour idle period it just sat there on its screen saver and failed to respond no matter which button I pressed.  I guess it was deep in REM sleep.  Finally after about 1 minute of this nonsense it did start to work again.  I don't know if this is how it's supposed to work or not but I've never had these kind of problems with any of my four Amazon Fire TV sticks.  I'll try the replacement they send but I have a feeling I'll be returning it too and just getting another Fire TV stick.  Too bad!

  I am real happy with this purchase. This stick does get warm, not an issue, and it's a bit long. If you have a TV that won't give you the length to clear the TV then you will need an adapter cable. Wasn't a problem on my Magnavox 1080p. This stick very much improves the resolution on the set, above what the TV is capable of! I was blown away by it. I downloaded the xfinity app as I have their service, but the voice remote is useless to call up channels with it using the xfinity app. It works fine on the roku app, but nothing else to date I have tried will work using the voice control on the remote. I can turn tv on by pressing just about any button BUT the power button on the remote, but the power button will shut it off just fine. I don't know why the power button won't do both. These are the reasons for the loss of a star on versatility. Still though, all in all, saving $$$$ on not paying rent for a box for the bedroom I bought it for, combined with the fact that it improves the picture quality so much, it's a sure bet to purchase!

  Bought this Roku Stick after finding out my Samsung 4K TV was old enough that the integrated app store on it was out of date and didn't have new apps on it. I use this now and have the USB powered by the 3.0 hub the TV has. I like that it turns on the TV so no need for the original remote. We have noticed (this is very seldom) that a message will appear in the top right corner and say the Roku is overheating. This message might stay for less than 5 minutes and go away. The Roku has never shutdown from it though. Not sure why it does that as the stick has adequate ventilation behind it. This does have a better processor being the 4K version and it is lightning fast when switching between apps/channels.

  Haven't cut the cable cord yet. This Roku is amazing! So many channels, I cant believe it! Have this hooked up to tv in the garage. No problems with reception. My router is all the way at the back of the house in our back bedroom. The extended range feature is well worth the money. So much to see and not knowing where to began. Love it!!! Highly recommend! Tried digital antenna. Forget it! Roku is the answer! Easy setup. It takes a while to set up because you choose what you want in channels. Well worth the effort! Do yourself a favor and get one for yourself. The voice remote is outstanding! ENJOY.

  My Roku delivered yesterday and I got it set up last night. We have one Roku TV already so I was able to sign in to our Roku account which really simplified things. The setup did take a while but it got all the channels we already had downloaded on our other tv which was awesome. I was NOT asked to pay an activation fee; it actually said at one point, (not word for word) that Roku will not ask for an activation fee. So far so good!UPDATE AFTER ONE WEEK OF USE: Everything is working great except I seem to have to be within like 5 feet of the tv to use the volume or power buttons so that’s kind of annoying.

  I’ve had several streaming devices and I always come back to Roku. I wanted a new 4K device and saw this one at Amazon. So I picked it up. Just like all other Rokus I’ve had it Waes super simple to setup and like to Hulu, PS Vue and other content providers. The UI is quick and I like it better than other streamers (sorry Amazon Fire TV). The only drawback I see is you have to use the provided mini-USB power cable as it has a built in antenna for WiFi. You can not use any old mini-USB you have around the house, and if this one breaks I have to go back to Roku to get another. But, that aside, it’s a great device and works just great.

  I switched from Direct TV to You Tube TV. I purchased 4 Roku Streaming Stick Plus sticks, one for each TV. I decided on these over other streaming sticks because they were the most affordable and had the highest ratings.I am super impressed on how easy they were to set up and use.  They have great WiFi speed with no buffering. My Samsung smart tv’s often buffer especially while watching 4K programs, but not these Roku’s.  They offer great performance and value.  You Tube TV is pretty awesome also.

  Works awesome. Simple easy to use.  But it doesn't have a TV tile on the home screen.  My other roku TV has the TV tile on the home screen.But this does not have the TV tile to select on the home screen.  You have to change the ""source"" and come out of the hdmi source and enter the TV source.Other than that.  I love the fact that you can use the roku remote for the TV as well!  This one has the power button and mute button. Other models don't.  This was a deal breaker for me.I like this one.  It can use dual bands of wifi as well.

  This product is well designed and an upgrade from my first model that enables off/on and volume control which eliminates the need to use two remotes. The picture quality and versatility are excellent.....when it works correctly.  For whatever reason, accessing Hulu or any other streaming service almost always requires that I turn it on, then shut it down and turn it on again.  Even more frustrating, often once on the first time, it becomes difficult to shut down.  It often takes 3 or 4 minutes to turn it on and secure access to Hulu.  I've tried all of the reset requirements, none seem to help.  My frustration is there is no help to fix it.  I'm likely to return the upgrade and go back to the 2 remote program, which worked fabulously.

  The thing I enjoy most about the firestick is the ability to get almost any streaming app I desire. Dish Anywhere app is available on Amazon firestick. For any of you that have Dish Network as your television provider, you can stream from your hopper, live tv, your recordings, and even on demand right to your phone, tablets, or Amazon firestick. When ever I travel I always bring mine with me and plug it into my hotel tv. I then have the ability to watch the programming I subscribe to and I can also stream Amazon Prime, Netflix, and many others. Amazon has been able to make my viewing and streaming needs far more accessible and hassle free.

  I've had this for 3 months and recently it's been glitching a LOT. Every day. Multiple times a day. I would say its biggest flaw is the fact that you can't turn it off. You can put it to sleep but the device never has time to reset. That is, until you've had it 3 months and you have to unplug it multiple times a day.

   I got my first fire stick in November and it worked for a while. Then it started logging me off my apps or programs. Sometimes it would buffer forever. I would plug it, unplug it, restart it, update it and so on... sometimes it would let me hear the sound of a show but show either no image or a frozen image. I called customer service and they told me to return it with all the pieces except with the controller so I did. I got my “new” later than expected, without a power cord or extension cord. I tried it with another cord I have at home and it won’t start... I wish I could get my money back...

  The device itself is a decent replacement for cost/cable cutting, but the Fire software could use work.Built in Web DVR works but doesn't always record scheduled shows and requires you to delete old watched programs and movies twice in order to fully get rid of them on your screen.UI is clumsy, finding shows and movies is awkward, (unless you use Alexa) and frankly just an overly-complicated mess.Most importantly; We frequently have to reset (Power Cycle) the device due to a black screen.No KTLA, no Comedy Central, and a few others, but nothing that would prevent me from buying it again....

  I bought this because of VUDU! I love VUDU and have all my movies from there. The only thing bad about this highly priced 4K streaming stick is that it doesn't include an HDMI extender! Why? Because my Samsung TV's have an indent where the HDMI ports are located. This stick is too long to fit, thus, an HDMI extender was needed for me to use this stick.The $10 cheaper, Amazon Fire 4K stick comes with an HDMI extender. So, I just assumed since this is its competitor device, that this would include one also. It didn't. Had to acquire my own HDMI extender :(Outside of that, it's a great streamer, if you need one that has VUDU (which the Amazon Fire 4K stick didn't have).

  At first I couldn't figure out how to use it but I called Samsung, and it plugs in the back of the tv and I then attached the 4 inch wire that came with it to the stick and plugged the other end in to the closest plug.  It works great.  I have no Idea how to use voice recognition or Alexa integration.  I am a retired Lady, and not very tech. I am happy with this new (to me) type of Roku and picture quality.

  This is the third Roku device that I've purchased, and it is considerably better than the two previous versions that were purchased years ago. Voice recognition works reasonably well. Easy setup. I find that I don't have to be as concerned about recording programs anymore, that I want to watch later, since all the network channels provide free streaming if those channels are included in your paid cable or satellite package.

  I replaced my old Roku Streaming Stick with this ""Plus"" model after upgrading my TV to a 4K projector. The interface is exactly the same, but is MUCH faster. Almost no lag loading apps, and menus are instantaneous. Voice recognition works well, and audio and video quality are great.My only complaint is with the 4:2:0  video compression detracting from subtle details like skin tones and skies. There is an option to use 4:2:2, but I think the real issue is that the streaming services are sending them in 4:2:0, so up-scaling them back to 4:2:2 does no good...in any case, I don't think I can blame Roku for this, and from normal viewing distances it's not really all that noticeable anyway...but on a 100+ inch screen, you don't have to get very close to notice it.

  I put a tv on our patio and was worried about running cable through the walls (brick). Such a fuss!  I read on all the different streaming devices and chose the Roku because it has an Xfinity app which is our cable provider. We can now sit on the patio and watch all of our channels and no wires through the wall!  Also, the Roku just plugs into the USB on the tv!  No need for a power supply but I’m glad it came with one and you didn’t have to pay extra for it!  I plan on getting another for our projector to have movie night in the back yard!I had trouble at first getting a solid connection to the internet. Signal would drop and movies would pause to buffer. I decided to upgrade my router. Wow!  Big difference!  It wasn’t the Roku at all!  The Nighthawk router cured that. Will also do my review on the Nighthawk too!The stream stick is larger than most but I had no problem using a different HDMI port. However, if you do have problems with plugging it up, they will send you an HDMI cable for free. So, either way, you’re covered.About the apps- yes, I bought the Roku because it has an app from my cable provider. Yet, that doesn’t mean that you can’t use it if you’re not with Xfinity. There are plenty other cable tv apps available!  Additionally, you can simply load the channel app that you want. I also enjoy the free tv apps like Pluto TV. Older movies but good ones and plenty to choose from!A built in web browser would make this unit complete!  Still won’t prevent a 5 star rating, though. I have used old desktops for years to connect to projectors and TV’s in my home and shop. The space savings is incredible - going from a desktop to a device the size of a USB jump drive!!  Not to mention the power savings!!We love it!

  I mostly got this for private listening. It works perfectly. That was the most important thing to me. The headphones I use pair well with my phone, so that part is where people would have problems. I really like that I can put apps that I only had in my tablet, some that didn't have casting ability on app, so now I can watch anything I want on the TV, and without disturbing sleeping people. There is also an option to level volume. So those super loud intros aren't so much louder than the show your watching. I haven't tried the voice search, since I usually only watch late at night and don't want to disturb people, so I can't comment on that. My TV supplies enough power to the stick even when off. If you look at the light and it's green it does, and if it's red it does not.

  We bought a new 4K smart TV.  You would think a plug in streaming device wouldn’t be necessary with a new smart TV.  But no... our operating system is based on android and they haven’t figured out how to play nicely with Apple, so we were forced into buying an add on streaming device.  We had a first generation Roku device which was just marginal.  This new Roku 4K streaming stick is a huge improvement.  Excellent 4K picture quality and HDR.  Easy set up and comes with a great remote.  I was shocked at how much content is  available.  Somewhere down the road I am sure we will cut ties with our cable provider.

  Plugged into HDMI input to my Samsung TV first, worked great. I'm only watching free shows, and signed up without a credit card on the Roku site. But it was a hassle to switch to the HDMI input to the TV, since I usually use my Marantz to watch DVD/Blu-Ray and my DVR for free Over-The-Air shows from my antenna. So I unplugged the HDMI from the TV, and plugged it into the HDMI input for Cable in the back of the Marantz. It has been working perfectly for several days now, and my remote lets me switch between them all. My only regret is losing the DVR functionality I have with my OTA reception - setting up recordings in advance, pause/play/skip capability, and having copies of things I recorded while I was doing other things.

  I have to reset my ROKU almost daily. Everything will be playing fine and then, without any warning,  the audio gurgles and echos.  I have to go into the settings for the ROKU and reset it. I also have issued with lip sync. I use the forward button for 2-3 frames and the lip sync is good. I tried this with the gurgling issue, but it does not help. in fact, no matter how far I go forward, when I reset the ROKU and restart my program it starts where the audio started actin up. Even if I have gone 10 minutes more into the show. Not happy. I am beyond the return window. so I have a $59 light paper weight. When I do rest the ROKU the screen says it does not have enough power even though it is plugged directly into the wall. When the ROKU does come back on the screen, it is dead. Just keep pressing the over button to get to the app you want. Eventually it will work. I guess I will have to try Amazon Fire and see if it is any better. I have been in contact with Roku and they say try these fixes. I have tried all the fixes except buying a new TV to see if it has issues on it. Their customer service is horrible.

  Already own another 2 of these devices, purchased this one to be a travel bag throw in so I can watch my streaming apps regardless of where I'm staying and not having to go through my phone or laptop to get to Netflix/Disney+/ESPN+/Hulu and what not.  These sticks are also great to replace the dated roku or Samsung smart apps built in on tvs that are no longer getting updates to apps.  Highly recommend this product.

  Although this Fire TC stick lite includes all the feature like the other Fire devices. But this one is extremely slow. Especially it updated last month, the App list is empty. To launch a third party app, it needs to go to app setting and find the app, to launch it. It's absolute not like what it describes in the product page.

  Sound randomly stops working, remote also randomly stops working. We even got an exchange from Amazon and it does the same thing. Not worth trying another exchange as they tell you to restart it etc, things I have already tried before reaching out to customer service. Our old fire stick works fine. Not sure what the problem it but we will just keep restarting it when he have problems and hope it keeps working

  Absolute garbage. Contacted Amazon support and they said I had a faulty fire stick. Sent it back and they sent a replacement TWICE and neither worked. Starts up fine and Amazon apps work great but if you try to use any other apps or streaming service you are sol. Apps have all been updated and data cleared uninstalled and reinstalled and still nothing. Think I might go buy an Apple TV or Roku for less hassle.

  the Alexa remote works great. You can turn off the TV, but you can't use Alex to  turn it on. In some channels I have to crank up the volume, not sure why. A great feature, is that it doesn't get overheated like my Roku, because it is plugged in back of your TV via the USB. Overall, I'm very happy with it and soon Prime Amazon members will get HBOMax added for free

  Thought I was getting a good deal on a 1080p streaming stick and coming from Amazon, I had decent expectations like for the device to ACTUALLY WORK. It did not, instead it was stuck on the unable to update screen after connecting it to my Wifi. It seems like this is a widespread issue a lot of people with this product are having yet no solution has been offered by Amazon. Even after following every troubleshooting guide, third-party forum, and discussed with Amazon Device Support team, it was still a useless paperweight. They issued me a refund, but its ridiculous that a product as popular as this has such a basic and common problem amongst so many people, ""budget"" option or not.

  I do like the ease of set up of the fire stick. I was able to find everything I was looking for and add all the other streaming services with ease. I have been using the product for three weeks now and noticed sometimes it doesn’t respond, almost as if the batteries are not working. I have changed them and it still does this. Eventually it will respond but it does have that fault. My daughters works fine. Maybe I just got a defective one?

  If you have a remote with your TV, then save some money and buy the Firestick Lite. The exact same remote without volume. Easy to install, works great.

  This is the lite version. It does not have volume control on this remote.  So far it works ok. I am still trying to figure out how to fast forward and rewind while watching shows.

  All it does is fire tv, which is fine for me. I can't ""judge"" how it does w/ Alexa itegration or voice control because the Fire TV Lite does not have that, so why is Amazon asking me to ""judge"" it. Not sure. I have a TV remote for TV and I don't have alexa components in the house so I didn't buy the more advanced Fire TV stick. The Lite does well and I'm happy with it. Would I buy it again - Yes.

  First time Roku owner and skeptical over the product setup and usage.  Set up was amazingly easy and ordering other streaming content is a breeze.  Found reviews that recommended using the outlet power to keep power to Roku powered up to avoid constant booting when power is removed.  The Roku does tend to get warm so an HDMI extention cabe is A MUST.  I have been DELERIOUSLY happy with the prchase and look forward to purchasing more units!

  My girl set it up for are little one. Said it was supper easy and worked as should. We got a roku tcl tv so we are familiar with the interface. I have used vizio and Samsung smart tv and can say from experience roku has a far better set up and quality. Quality of the stream depends 100% on your internet and if any physical objects can interfere. Dont blame roku if your internet isn't good and you want to stream 4k. Thats your fault.

  This is now my 3rd roku, of all different generations. In short they all work very well and I'm a big fan of the new stick approach. One thing to note is that the product gives the option for a USB or outlet powered use. As the instructions indicate, a red light will illuminate and a notification will present on the screen if the USB does not have enough power. However, I find this is  also potentially a temporary problem as the TV starts up and starts feeding power to the device. After about a minute or so, this message disappears and the device works as normal. While your results may vary, if you are pressed to find an outlet and have a a little older Samsung lcd TV, in my experience it's only a minute or so, tops, before the TV is able to power the device. That said, it may function a bit better with even more power via an outlet, however I have had no issues yet.

  This has been super easy to use so far. Really simple plug and play, I even used the USB port on the back of my TV to power it and haven't had any issues yet (Samsung nu6900, if you're wondering). It detected 4k HDCP and hasn't given me any problems yet, but I've had it less than a day so I'll update if I come across any issues.The remote has a nice sturdy feel when you ""click"" the buttons, but I haven't used the voice option yet (and probably won't, tbh). I'm amazed at all the free content. My main reason for getting this was for HD streaming, but also because there's a Wow Presents Plus app. I was using my Chromecast to access that before, but the Chromecast is so moody and relies on my phone. It was always losing the wifi connection too. The Roku has a 2G and 5G wifi, which is exactly what my Spectrum router offers. I'm a convert so far.

  I had a little difficulty installing at 1st but I think it was me trying to rush installation.  It is plug and play but you need about 30 min to let everything upgrade, locate in install your wifi and such.  If you hurry it won't connect properly.  It took me two attempts but the 2nd time around I took a seat and let it do all it's installation without immediately jumping into the next step.  That time installed perfectly and when you hit the remote button TV turns right on connected to everything.  So love this thing just can be a little difficult to install

  These things are amazing. We have 4 primary TVs (and 3 in the kids bedrooms that they use w/ DVD players only), and 2 are really newer smart Roku-based Smart TV's...and even they are not as fast as these Roku Streaming+ Sticks. We upgraded two ""other"" larger TVs (in the guest room & upstairs living room) after completely switching to streaming TV (vs land line AT&T TV), and by god I could not be happier. Each unit was easy to install / supports virtually all streaming applications / is super fast / and the thing even automatically programs itself to control the volume & power of your TV (on the included Roku remote) *automatically*. Wow, is all I can say. Upgrade your old TVs, or even newer TVS (any TV older than one year with an HDMI port) with this thing. You won't regret it.

  Oh happy day ! ! ! !  Roku is awesome! I should of done this "" a week from last Tuesday."" I recently cancelled my cable TV as it wasn't worth the $100. bucks a month I was spending on it.  It was so disappointing , most everything offered I didn't want to watch anyway, besides I needed to cut expenses.  With Roku, ( a ONE TIME affordable cost,) the free channels and my Amazon Prime membership offer me everything I could want, and more!  Amazon Prime has some great movies and shows to watch , as good or better than Netflicks, HBO, etc.  There is no downside to this, as long as you have a good wireless internet you are good to go! Added plus- it is easy-peasy to set up.

  Please note there is a scam that will redirect you to a site that will charge you to connect your Roku box.  Please ensure you entered the exact URL you see on your screen when you are setting up the box.  ROKU will NOT charge you to setup the box.This streaming stick is incredible.  you can rid yourself of multiple remotes and just have one remote that operates our TV and streaming.The buttons that take you straight to SLING and net flicks are very nice.The rage of this remote is incredible.  I can adjust my TV  from across the house.Overall its a great buy

  Bought this to replace my Roku.  My main use is for AT&T TV and I found this does not provide a small preview window in fast forward or reverse so I  have to guess at the time remaining to skip commercials.  It may be a function of the AT&T app, but the window is there in Roku.  There is a fast forward window in Netflix so the stick would seem to have that capability.  I also prefer the Roku home screen which is cleaner, showing only my installed apps.I also have issues with the remote buttons spaced too closely together so it is too easy to press the wrong button, especially the bottom button instead of the play button.A positive is to be able to tell Alexa to open an app.

  After you install it, you will have to do power cycle because the firestick loses connection. You have to remove the USB cord from the HDMI and the batteries from the remote for 1 minute.  When you reconnect it will work again. Hopefully its just a time thing, I will change rating if it is continuous.

  It's somewhat confusing when trying to determine what is free and what has a price attached to it. It's almost as if the bottom line is the last thing you're informed about. The item needs an instruction booklet included that informs the purchaser how to navigate using the devise.Mostly what we've used it for at this point is music selections. We've found that very rewarding.

  Form a low price this made all the difference to my older TV. Fire TV adds so many advantages to a older less than super smart TV. The streaming apps are better designed and work better with richer interfaces.  And the voice control makes it easy to get to the program you want to watch. Set up is easy.

  This generation of Roku Stick is much improved over previous generations with a smooth and seamless integration with the smart TV. Now, the Roku can control the TV's volume! Because the stick is powered by a USB cord, it can be powered off of the TV's USB ports resulting in a clean and hidden installation. The smart TV and the Roku function as one seamless unit after install.This is the best generation Roku yet.

  I had grown sick and tired of Directv, after AT&T had merged with them, despite a 20 year relationship.  Before I left them I ordered one of these Roku Streaming Stick+ units to try streaming.  In addition to free streaming channels I tried Playstation Vue and Sling Blue as my subscription services.  The installation was easy in my system, the hardest part being setting up the various accounts and passwords and that wasn't very hard at all.The Roku passed the test with flying colors.  The picture and audio quality have been awesome on my 4K system.  I have had one or two dropouts, but that was prior to me receiving the Roku OS 8 upgrade.We have since purchased a second Roku for the bedroom, cancelled Directv and are saving $50+ per month.  We are very happy with the unit and the results.

  I bought this for one reason and one reason only - I wanted to watch our Vudu movies with Dolby Atmos on our Samsung MU8000 TV and HW-K850 soundbar.  I couldn't do this with the Vudu app on our Sony Blu-Ray or the Vudu App on the Samsung TV.  I got tired of waiting and waiting, so I just bought this.  After all, I bought the sound bar for Atmos and the only way I could do this is with a UHD disc and since I don't buy discs anymore, this makes this quite difficult to play movies in Atmos.It works pretty good for this - why pretty good?  The Vudu app is glitchy on Roku.  If I preview movies, the sound will cut out entirely and I have to power off everything and back on or I can cycle the soundbar through various sources until I get back to the source connected to the Streaming Stick.  Either way, it is a major pain.  If I fast forward, rewind or do anything else, the sound may cut out and I have to revert to one of the two solutions mentioned.  Once a movie starts with Atmos, it will usually continue to play in Atmos without an issue.The only workaround I found and this is not a good one, is to change the sound settings in Roku to stereo, preview the movies I am interested in, make up my mind (which can take a while, something which my wife can attest to), change the Roku sound settings back to Dolby XXX+++ (just made that up) and select the movie and hope to god the streaming doesn't pause and cause my Atmos to go out.I don't know if this is Vudu's issue, Roku's issue, or if this issue can only be solved by the god of thunder, but it is highly annoying.  Please somebody fix this and I will bump my rating to 5 stars!

  Installed the latest one on my mom's TV. I new it would not fit by itself in the recessed slot on her TV so I ordered a six inch hdmi extension dongle at the same time. Installed easy and works great.Update 9/2019: Bought another one for a new 4k TV and is awesome. Picture is outstanding and wifi enabled remote works fantastic - no pointing, just use it. Ended up attaching the stick to an hdmi extension to move it away from the hdmi interference from the TV in order for the remote to work well. Not Roku's fault, just certain TVs (you know what I mean Samsung) put out a lot of signal noise from the connection panel.UPDATE: Bought second one for a better 4K HDR TV and results are excellent. I use this to control a Smart TV over the TVs built in features. This Roku produces an outstanding picture. I use it with my cable TV companies apps (I have Spectrum and Xfinity in different locations) and it produces better picture and sound than the cable hookup does. Highly recommend it.

  This is quite fantastic - can use to stream anywhere in the house.

  Bought this for my mom, who is stuck home and wanted to stream different shows. Easy to set up but to get started, they send a code to your computer and you have to enter your name, address, gender and birthdate. Also your credit card should you choose to get pay-per-view content, I guess. A lot of information needed, and I never trust these companies keeping it private.

  Wanted to get rid of my 2nd cable box and this fits the bill. I have an older 22 in. Insignia flat screen tv. With ROKU streaming stick it's like a smart tv now. I have prime video, netflix, vudu fandango, peacock, pluto, Showtime and many, many, more.plus I do get a couple of my local news stations. For the price it is a win, win situation.

  I purchased this item to replace an Xfinity box that Comcast charges $10 per month to rent.  Download the Xfinity app for Roku and the thing works great.  The voice remote works.  However, with that said, it does have some limitations.  Using the Roku voice remote you can search for Roku apps, but you can't search for channels within the app.  Example.  in the Xfinity app, you say ""History Channel"" into the remote, and Roku pulls up the History Vault app for Roku, not the History Channel.  Otherwise, no complaints.  And I'm saving $120/year on rental.

  The product worked as advertised. I had an LG tv that was a problem child in all 5 years that it lived in our bedroom. Despite being within 15 feet of the WiFi router, it had a spotty connection at best. On top of that, the LG store didn’t have all of the streaming services that we use. I decided to try Roku to help with both problems and it absolutely does! Strong, constant connection and all of our streaming services and then some. Have never had a problem out of it. Of course, 3 weeks after that, the tv died altogether... But the roku continues to work wonderfully in another TV.

  This is my fourth Roku device. I turned in all but two cable boxes. It is night to be able to get apps like Netflix available on all roku attached TV's. Now and then it doesn't open up and I have to reset the button on the device and then it usually goes back online. I gave up cable boxes and got these. I hoped to save money but the cable company raised its prices so I am paying the same as I was but not what the raises would have cost me! Cable of course is faster to turn on. Roku takes about 20-30 seconds to open and get to the apps. Something to get used to, but as long as it works, I like it. I only have one remote, maybe two with voice recognition. I haven't used it so I gave it a neutral rating.

  I bought 2 different Roku devices for my family when we discontinued our cable. This one, for about $50 which we use in our family room, and the “express” version for $25.00 for the bedroom. The less expensive one in the bedroom work fine, no problems. THIS version however doesn’t.  The audio doesn’t line up with the video, so you’ve got a news reporter movining their lips, with their words lagging a couple sentences behind.  The only way to “fix” it is to turn off the tv, then  unplug the Roku for a few minutes.So, if im really trying to listen to something that I’m interested in, I either have to deal with looking at the video without the audio lining up, OR stop everything for abou 5 minutes to reboot. This started happening about a week ago and I know the problem is with this unit, because my son streams the same channels in his room, and I stream the same channels in my room, using different streaming devices with no issues.I hope it’s not too late to return this.

  Love the Roku device! Bought as a gift for my in-laws and they don't do any streaming services at all. After going through the set up process, which they thought was a bit long and intense, they really liked it. However, after a couple uses the remote stopped working. I contacted Amazon support and all they'd do is give me a refund with return of the device. Which is understandable. That being said, my in-laws already have cc info on device so decided not to return it, so I canceled it and will be purchasing a new remote for them, essentially unnecessary. When I asked about doing an even exchange I was told the product was OOS, but I was able to click on same item I purchased and reorder it. Not OOS than right? Maybe someone can enlighten me on this. The main kicker is that of course I had gotten this item on sale during the holidays so I wouldn't be able to reorder it with the refund, it'd end up costing me more. I was offered a $5 promotional credit but that would not have covered the difference. I understand they can only do so much and from where I sit, I just needed a remote! As I was searching for a new one, many of them were not compatible with the device either...It's not like it was a big ticket item, didn't think it'd be that difficult just to get a remote replaced, but guess I wasted my time, Amazon's time, and now additional money to replace this remote. I hope you can understand my frustration here!

  Used to replace Roku built in to TV. TV is in bedroom some distance from router and often lost signal. Roku stick plus seems to pick up signal much better than built-in Roku. It solved my problem with losing signal. I see people claiming Roku charges for additional devices--this is not true! I have seven or eight devices registered and never paid extra. I am limited to two devices streaming at once because I pay the lowest monthly fee.

  I bought this Roku Streaming Stick+ to first try out in our bedroom. I figured if it worked well there, I'd get a couple more for living room and guest room in our effort to move away from the ridiculous price of standard DT or DN cable providers for mostly a bunch of channels and shows I don't care about.I just wanted to be able to chill out in my bedroom and watch something without having to call DT to fix the box in there that stopped working forever ago. I was curious if the wifi connection would be strong enough as our router is several rooms away. It works great and I've never had an issue with it working. Setup was straightforward and simple.I'm here to buy another one!

  Bought both the Roku Streaming Stick+ & Fire TV 4k at the same time a couple of months ago.  Both work well with my TVs and either should satisfy most users.  At the time only the Roku could get YouTube TV and I wanted to evaluate that vs. Hulu to cord cut.  I like the Roku live TV menus and the fact that it's ""neutral"" in it's programming emphasis, so I thought that's the way I'd go for my other TVs.  But . . . the remote.  Hmmm.  Fire TV remote is MUCH better.  Can't believe the Roku doesn't have a ""Mute"" button.  The other thing I didn't know until I hooked these up on my family room TV is that the Fire TV remote can also control surround sound components like a receiver; the Roku can't.  I only have one TV where this makes a difference, but there it's a deal breaker for the Roku.

  Here's something you should know. Don't be fooled by the ""quad processor"" being used to sell this as a quick little device. It is incredibly slow and Roku is struggling to keep their hardware up to par with the power needs introduced by the software. This thing constantly crashes, constantly resets, has great difficulty changing the cursor and menus (freezes), and apps like Netflix and Sling commonly will not start and an error message appears to ""please force close the app and wait 1 minute."" Do yourself a favor and stay away from Roku. Their time has come and passed.

  My TV is finally obsolete-after 5 yrs w/ one prime streaming service. I remember the old Roku prior to the ""new"" TV and dreaded using a device again. I ordered the stick based on ratings and my current need. WOW......it is sooooo much user friendly than the old days(5 + yrs old) with very good picture resolution. And it comes w/ free channels, no hassle, & easy to use-incld setup. I actually LIKE IT-alot, something I never thought I'd say when it comes to having a device for streaming. Better pic, with unexpected benefits.

  The Roku was reasonably priced, easy to setup, and use.  Setup only took a few minutes. My family and I were able to watch movies with in 20 minute after taking the Roku out of the box.  There is no need to subscribe unless you want to as there are many free channels. You can quickly channel surf through the channels. I plan only buying another for my bedroom. Roku will help me save on my cable bill. I’ll be able to save about $250 a year off my cable bill.

  I’m new to Roku and it’s been great. I’ve always had Apple TVs but having change to YouTube TV away from traditional cable I opted to buy this Roku streaming stick plus as it was compatible with YouTube TV.  I also use quite often prime video, Netflix, HBO now, UFC fight pass, Amazon music and YouTube, all of which are easy to navigate to from the home screen. I do wish I could customize which of the short-cut buttons were on my remote as I will never use any of them other than Netflix and perhaps Hulu.  Also I wish there wasn’t an advertisement on the right side of the homepage, but it’s really not so invasive.  Ultimately this is cheaper, more compatible with the things that I use, and just as effective as any other device I’ve had, so I am happy. The one thing I miss is “mirroring” whatever is on my phone screen to my Apple TV. But this has been very simple to use, I think I’m going to set my parents up with Roku and YouTube TV.

  Sick and tired of AT&T playing all the tricks on the cable/internet bill. Decided to try it before cutting the cable.Turned out it was one of the best buys of the year. Easy to install and use, with a lot of choices of programs to choose from, the picture quality is terrific 99% of the time (guess it depends on the internet connection), the user interface is very friendly, almost no effort to learn anything new to use it, even a 5-year old can easily figure out by herself how to get to her favorite cartons.  And it saves a lot of money every month, why do I have to pay $60+/month for a cable package of which 80% of the channels I never watch? Cable TV is dying!!!

  Easy setup. We keep having issues with sound though. Often we'll try to use the fire stick, but the audio won't come on. We've tried trouble-shooting. It's def a problem with the stick - not the tv. Unsure what gives.

  Works fine. Only issue I dislike is that if you put it to sleep, to bring it back online, you have to disconnect it from power and reconnect then wait for it to boot back up. I solved this issue by just connecting it to a smart switch so I don't have to deal with squeezing behind the TV to unplug the power.

  My old Fire stick's remote stopped working, and it was too confusing to try to use our cable company's with it....so just bought this one. I never use the alexa function, and it does what it needs to do to get me to hulu, netflix and amazon prime video. Amazon products, overall, make me happy.

  This turned out to be a real problem because it didn’t work.  When we called customer support they told us it was reported lost or stolen so they deprogramed it and evidently put it back on the shelf and ultimately ended up sending it us.  After some back and forth we got it straightened out.

  I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He had really been looking forward to trying this and now even he hates it, which is hard to accomplish.  It worked for two weeks before we started having serious issues with it.  We had to unplug and plug it back in because it often wouldn’t even load shows or movies and sometimes, it would quit altogether and I’d get a black screen when I went to do something as menial as switching from Disney+ to Netflix.  I know that this was an issue solely with the Fire Stick because my other streaming devices worked and loaded shows and movies just fine.  If you’re buying this to save money instead of buying the Apple TV, don’t make the same mistake I did.  Do better, Jeff.

  I bought it because my last fire stick was having issues. It was an impulse purchase and was on sale. It is definitely worth the price but was a little bit difficult to set up. My wifi kept kicking it out and I had to reset it twice. It finally took and now works beautifully. I love it and will probably buy another one for my other room.

  The voice recognition and Alexa integration makes this a great buy. It’s easy to connect everything and has worked great since being connected. It was an easy install and because we have other fire sticks, all we had to do was put in the passwords for our streaming services and it was great.

  Why a 1 star review? Because the last 2 fire sticks died rather quickly and Amazon will do nothing to help. I had to buy the protection plan this time incase the device stops working again like the last one did in less than 6 months of owning. It’s a great device when they work, but they don’t seem to last long at all.

  Worked for a few hours then remote would no longer communicate w/ Firestick.Tried to return 3 TIMES but Amazon did not offer the RETURN option without speaking with the Firestick Support Desk.Before I could return I HAD to speak w/ one of their Firestick ""experts"".  I kept putting that off because I knew the product was defective and did not want to spend 20 minutes on phone and presented with all their pre-scripted fixes.  Believe it or not, I AM smart enough to make sure the batteries were good, and the TV was turned on, etc.TODAY I finally decided to call BUT now I have somehow missed the return period for this POS.NOT HAPPY.

  I've had the Roku Streaming Stick+ for about a week now and I am very impressed with it. I have used a Sony Blu-Ray player with streaming capabilities for about thee years, but it has quirks and the software is rarely updated. It's usability had become so poor that I began checking into other players such as Roku. I almost bought the same model at Costco but decided to see if  Amazon's prices was better - which it was, to the tune of $10, and with Prime I got it delivered the next day.Installation was quick and easy, as was setup. There are literally hundreds of additional streaming channels, both pay and free, to download in addition to those pre-installed on the device. Since I bought it, we have used it every day almost to the exclusion of my cable subscription and our DVD/Blu-Ray library. It's not only the selection of material, but also the quality of the picture (I'm running 1080p on a 60"" plasma TV) and audio. There's never any pause for buffering like the Sony player would do on the same internet connection, no skips or dropped frames. The controls are simple and easy to use, even for my wife who's often hopeless with technology. I'm very pleased with my Roku and can't wait to upgrade to a 4k TV so I can take advantage of the device's capabilities at that resolution. I would buy it again and recommend it to anyone who wants a quality streaming device.

  This item is of the high quality I expect from Roku. Set up was very easy and navigation is what we have learned to expect from Roku. I have this device attached to a 13 or 14 year old Toshiba TV we have in our bedroom and the improvement in the TV picture is amazing! It works great and I'm very pleased. My wife is a Brit so she hasn't tried the voice recognition and I personally don't mind manually searching for shows or movies as I often come across something better than what I was searching for so I have not used the voice commands. Besides, with the pandemic, I'm in no rush. For the money, this is an especially good product. I recommend this product!

  For the most part I haven't had any issues with this device. It seems to work fine. However, there's one BIG issue that drives me nuts! When the company updates the software on the device, it wipes out all my settings, and I have to set it up again as if I were installing it for the first time. I hate it when I turn on the TV to watch a movie and discover I have to go through the 20-minute process of reconnecting the remote, registering the Roku device online, picking my settings again, and then logging back in to my channels. Any programmer worth their salt knows to save the user's settings before doing an update. I'm going to look for something else to replace this device.

  Roku makes transition to cord cutting extremely easy (way easier than I imagined possible.)  I now have 4 of these units and have cancelled my Cable TV about 2 months ago - never looked back... a shocking world change.  One thing you should be aware of:  make sure you have a relatively high quality, fairly new WiFi router before you switch over.  These devices need a lot of buffering and router interaction for them to work smoothly.  With good internet service, these ROKU devices deliver a smooth, high quality experience.

  Out of the box, this device was great for the first few weeks. Streaming quality is as expected, the user interface is easy to use, has all the apps i need. The remote that comes with the device was easy to set up with my 10 year old LCD display.  This advertises with Long-Range wireless, but i find that my standard run of the mill Firestick did a better job of picking up the wireless and staying ahead with buffering. This device constantly has to lower the quality and buffer to keep up. That being said, i have 300mbps fiber service using a gaming router so i don't believe the wireless is an issue. All that aside, my biggest issue with the device is the UI is unresponsive more times than not. While watching youtube tv, netflix, etc and when trying to exit the program it almost seems as the remote batteries are dead, though the volume and tv power buttons still respond.  Even when flipping through the home page menu, every so often the screen will lock up.

  This device is capable but has many annoying quirks that sometimes seem unbearable, especially if you don’t have time to have something you pay for not exactly do what it is supposed to do. Example 1: the forward/reverse 15 seconds function goes much farther than 15 seconds, like an uncontrollable amount of minutes. Anyone have time for that BS? Not me. Note that the Amazon Firestick has the same function but it actually works. Example 2: sometimes the remote control button functions do not immediately command the screen display, sometimes with many seconds between when you press the button and when the display responds. This makes it uncontrollable and very frustrating.In summary, don’t waste your money. I have an Amazon Firestick and it performs flawlessly and is what this piece of junk should be.

  I have now cut the cable cord.  This works just fine.  Once you have it set up, it is very easy to tab through and see all the shows you would want.  Connects with Netflix, YouTube TV, Prime, etc.  The voice control part of the remote is a life saver.  Gets you to where you want to go fast.  Only minor drawback is where the volume buttons are located.  They are on the side and my finger hits the mute button sometimes when I change stations.  No biggy though.  I have not tried to connect this to Alexa so I don't know about that function.

  I got this hoping to avoid hooking it up to a power strip. Unfortunately it wasn't getting enough power from the usb port on my tv so every few hours it refused to work until I plugged it directly into the power strip. Other than that it is a roku device and all the roku's are an incredible deal considering what you're getting so I will still give it 5 stars.

  Awesome product! Set up was a breeze and the update took maybe 60 seconds total with the restart. I'm honestly pleased with this device although I did have some concerns. One concern was over some reviews saying they were being charged but I will quote the set up guide ""Roku does not charge for activation support - beware of scams."" I was not charged at all. I was also wondering if my TV could power this stick or if it required a wall outlet. The box provides both a cable for your TV to power the stick if you have a USB port and a wall outlet in case you don't or if your TV does not have sufficient power. This stick is working amazing so far and is quick and easy to use. I highly recommend it. I needed this particularly for an app we use called living scriptures for us and our kids.

  This a great device but...SCAM ALERT, it does not cost anything to activate a Roku. There is something wrong in the setup procedure that tells you to call a number you think is Roku support. It is not and they will try to get you to pay them  to ""activate"" the unit for you. This is a scam and the Better Business Bureau has gotten multiple complaints. Do not fall for it; my husband hung up when they said it would be $250.00 to activate it. Also, this product was brand new, not refurbished in anyway.

  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Roku stick works. After reading the reviews, I opted for this since it was a little easier on my wallet than the Roku Premiere. I have a Roku 3, but I wanted to get something that I could use to enjoy UHD on a newer TV. Besides the fact that I can access UHD content, I think the stick actually might work better than my Roku 3 does. I've only had it for a couple weeks, though. If I run into any significant issues with it, I will be sure to update my review.One note, in case it might help some, is that I had originally hoped to plug the stick into my A/V receiver, which would then feed to my TV. However, my A/V receiver could only output a maximum resolution of 1080p. So that kind of defeated the purpose of getting the new stick. I ended up plugging it into my TV directly and then using an optical audio cable to run to my A/V receiver. I am not sure if the sound that is 5.1 surround, as I am only running a 3.1 system on this particular TV.

  I purchased this Roku Streaming Stick+ for an older flat screen TV that I have (that's not a SmartTV with all the apps already built-in). It works great!. If you are used to regular CableTV/SatelliteTV, you won't have every channel option on the planet, so it's not for everybody. But I save over $150 PER MONTH on CableTV, so I'll get used to a few less options. It still has 90% of what I watched before anyways, and the savings will pay for a brand new Quantum processor SmartTV in just a few months. NOTE: You will need a basic internet connection for this to work (doesn't need to be a super fast connection--it even streams well over a VPN connection).

  Product works as expected EXCEPT that the battery life in the remote is HORRIBLE. If I don't take the batteries out of the remote when not in use they will be dead in three days or less! Seriously, I am not kidding! This is UNACCEPTABLE!I turned to the Roku Community Forum hoping to find an answer but instead I find this is not a new problem. In fact it has been a HUGE issue for MONTHS and Roku has done NOTHING to remedy the problem. Again, UNACCEPTABLE!If I don't hear from Roku within a week with a reasonable remedy I will return this product and purchase a non-Roku related product.If I get a satisfactory resolution I will update my post.VERY DISAPPOINTED!

  After having a nice Fire TV for a few years, we went with a Roku Stick. Bad choice. I am very unhappy that in under 60 days, the darn thing overheats! They say to put it onto an extender, and keep it away from other items. What? I don't care to have extraneous things hanging off the back of my TV. To have something almost brand new come up with overheating issues is terrible. I would not recommend this to anyone!

  I have no complaints. This is my third and I'll likely get a 4th, and maybe a 5th and 6th (which I believe is the max for one account). My wireless router is kept inside a cabinet in the center of the house and it still works with my tv hanging on the inside of an exterior wall in my garage.  The reception I receive really is surprising which is why I buy only this Roku model with it's improved wireless reception capability.I do wish I didn't have to reactivate all my streaming channels with the installation of each device. It would be nice if it just carried over the activations from my Roku account every time I installed one.

  I have only been using this a few months. I had the original roku several years ago, even gave a few as gifts, but I have had nothing but problems with the roku stick. For the past week every time I sit down to watch something I have to do my own research, tech support and maintenace and I am tired of it. The audio stopped working, searched online because due to ""Covid"" no phone support. Could not get directed to email support because my problem was not listed. So, after researching and finding MANY people having problems, I had to disconnect and reconnect EVERYTHING. This works for maybe a day and then starts all over again. No audio, garbled audio, stick overheating...EVERY DAY!  Check online about reviews, problems, etc before you buy.

  I have had this product less than 5 months and already it is broken. Used it maybe a couple of times a week and now trying to use it the screen is green and has lines going all across the screen. I have tried a reset, still hasn't worked. Double checked it was my TV itself, but it isn't the TV because the applications on the actual TV does work. Tested out all HDMI ports and even using different HDMI chords, but still no change.Wouldn't recommend or buy this product again.I should have just purchased an Amazon Fire TV Stick.

  I have it's competitor from the online marketplace with the stick that's on fire and I prefer the Roku due to the fact I can organize the layout of the short cuts. In both cases you have adds that you can't disable but I find the ones from Roku less obtrusive (took me 2 weeks to notice add were being displayed).  This one is a little more expensive than it's competitor but the remote is also much better with the on/off button and the volume buttons. I still give it a 5 star rating but a back light in the remote would be really nice.

  Can't say enough about this Roku streaming stick. I didn't have good luck with the Express version of this product so I thought I would give this streaming stick a try. The streaming aspect is really great. Brings in Discovery+ beautifully and I have voice in the remote. Love it. My tv had only 2 HDMI ports and unfortunately the only available port was almost unreachable. I took my makeup mirror, laid it on my dresser and using it I guided the Roku into the port. Now you can't even see the Roku streaming stick. My husband was impressed!

  I upgraded to the Roku Streaming Stick+ about 3 weeks ago. the streaming signal is glitchy. I did everything they said to get the ""best"" streamig quality, but every few minutes the picture and audio cut out for a second or two, or the picture will start flickering every few seonds. once these starts happening, it slowly increases in frequency.when I unplug the device from the tv and plug it back in, it sometimes stops doing these things for a short while. if I had it to do over again, knowning what I do now, I would not have gotten this device.and then I found out that the upgraded HBO isn't going to be available on Roku....when I have slack in my budget again, I'll have to research other, non-Roku, streaming devices.

  When I ordered this thing it gave me a notice that the device would be scanned and registered to my Amazon Account.  Really?  It took me 5 minutes and 4 web pages to enter a code it gave me to ""REGISTER IT TO MY ACCOUNT"".  It works as advertised, but how about a little truth in adverting?

  Got this because my PS3 is no longer supporting a lot of apps. I should have upgraded to a fire stick ages ago. It’s fast, doesn’t freeze, I don’t have to close out one app to enter another, I just tell Alexa to open up the other app and she does it all. It’s great. Plus I can ask Alexa anything. It’s great for me. I love this fire stick.

  I have an older fire stick with an older OS (5.4) and recently bought this one for a second TV. The new OS (7.x) has a new OS that is a downgrade from the previous one. The old one was pretty intuitive and the new one is clearly trying to push amazon apps and their TV. It sucks. Buy a roku instead.

  The device works well when it works, but it doesn't work often. Every time I turn on my TV, the firestick doesn't connect to the input. I have to physically unplug it, wait a couple minutes, then plug it back in. When I turn it on again, it does start up, but usually with no sound. I then have to go to the settings menu and choose the option to restart my firestick. It rarely works after the first try, so I have to then restart it again to get it to connect with sound.When it all works, it's great and I love how easy it is to navigate between apps and find things to watch. But most days, I get tired of all the rebooting, so I just default back to my chromecast.

  Not sure what the difference could be between the lite and the regular 🤔 It has a good amount of memory, graphics are great, you can play games and it still has all the streaming services that I subscribe to plus more 😲.. Not to mention the voice control perk. Seems heavy duty for it to be called a lite. Extremely satisfied with my purchase 😃👍 Oh but I don't know anything about volume control because it doesn't have it 😳

  This was easy to set up. It improved the picture on my tv, but since the Lite doesn’t have volume controls I need to use two controllers. Nevertheless, I’m very pleased with this purchase.

  Couldn't believe this was so cheap.  It makes any TV smart.  Even better, I actually used it to turn a dumb computer monitor that I had lying around (with an HDMI in port) into a TV by adding the TV Stick and then linked it to a blue tooth speaker. Now it works just like a TV!  So happy.

  and I'm very disappointed so far. At least when i was able to watch on my Roku, I did not have to keep restarting the device so that the screensaver would not come up in the middle of watching. I am CONSTANTLY restarting the device after the video freezes while playing an advertisement while the stream audio continues to play in the background. Other times it just refuses to start playing a stream. This might primarily be a Twitch app problem but Amazon forced me into buying this device if i wanted to continue conveniently watching Twitch on my TV. It wouldn't be so bad if the device actually worked well. Not even kidding--the screensaver came up in the middle of a stream while I was typing this review.

  Still cannot believe all that is available on this Fire stick.  Much of the tuning easily done by Alexa.  This Alexa and our home Alexa apparently know each other, no conflicts.  The remote Alexa will even do some of the home Alexa skills.  Again, so much is available with this Firestick.

  Very easy set-up.  Not quite plug and play, but not much more difficult than that.Since streaming is the way of the present/future, and not everyone has smart TVs, this is a nice alternative.  Let's face it, smart TVs aren't going to be able to keep up with all the new streaming services that are added monthly it seems, whereas Fire Stick will be able to add the aps needed for the services you choose.There are some limitations to what Alexa can do from the Fire Stick, but all in all, ""she"" does what you need within that environment.

  So much for the claims of easy installation. I could not get this to work. I tried any number of combinations, three sets of new batteries, I even switched the power cord with the one for my Kindle. Nothing. And I missed the deadline for returning it. I hope other people have better luck with it.

  Dumped Satellite TV and now watching everything I want on YouTube TV and Amazon Prime on two formerly non-smart TVs and two that were only somewhat smart. They are really smart now. Very easy setup and works great. Have now added several other streaming Apps with 1000s of free movies. No more boxes, no more dish, no more contracts...

  I've dealt with a number of different streaming devices and Fire Stick/TV is the best I've seen.Best Home screen layout.  Still has all the busy ads and junk like all the rest, but I can get past that.  Very easy to add apps.Like all these devices, it gets slow sometimes but not often.  I have to reboot it maybe once a month.

  This lite little device has been upgraded to the same processor as the 4k and is easier to add your preferred apps. Same speed as the 4k and quite the price on sale. Very impressed. I have the cube, shield, and the chromecast newbie but  this firestick lite is the best bang for the buck and handles everything I've thrown at it. Sending a few to friends for Christmas that don't have cable and won't need it now...

  I love the Fire Stick Lite. Purchased 3 when they were on sale for 17.99. We are exploring cutting the cord and I like that I can try the fire stick for less than 20. The app choices are great, love that I can turn my 3 non-smart tvs into a smart tv for such a small cost. The Alexa Voice integration works well, no issues with that. Don't really care that it doesn't work for controlling our tvs, we have remotes for them so not a huge deal. Overall I am happy with the product

  I love my fire stick! Unfortunately I have to unplug it and plug it in every time because nothing on the remote wakes it up from sleeping. Maybe I just got a bad remote. I've watched multiple Amazon movies and often listen to music while working. Highly suggest buying one of these. You won't regret it.

  I bought the Firestick lite from a big box retailer and was hoping for good things.  I had been using Roku and thought I'd upgrade.  After using the Firestick for a short time it started having issues with no sound.  I searched out an answer and found that if I pushed the home and play button at the same time, it would reset and the sound would come back on.  Great, or so I thought.  It kept doing it more frequently and I have just gotten fed up with it and have gone back to the Roku.  If you buy, I hope you have better luck than me.

  Our cable bill got ridiculous, we were paying $259 a month, so We bought four Roku’s  for a bedroom living room family room and basement, I need to buy two more for other televisions. We are pleased with how many programs are on that we really like and a lot of free television. We pay for a couple channels that we like but they only cost us 4.99.One great thing about Roku as we are watching the full series of programs several years ago and it’s exciting because we don’t remember watching them so it’s like watching them from the very beginning. We definitely are going to buy a couple more Roku’s, it’s way better than cable

  Roku RF remotes are the worst remotes I've ever used. I've had three in one room. Three. They all had the same problem, which was that they froze frequently and failed to work. After enough times replacing the batteries and unplugging the Streaming Stick and plugging it back in it just got easier to realize that Roku remotes are garbage. Replacing them has become tiresome. I now use an app on my phone to operate my Roku Streaming Stick, and because the Roku remote turns the TV on and controls the volume I have to do those things with a separate remote. The seller isn't bad, and tried to work with me. I did get stuck paying for the last replacement because it is too much of a hassle to keep multiple remotes straight, but that's not their fault. But the Streaming Stick has nothing that really makes it better than competing products and the remotes are really garbage.

  I just installed my new roku and within thirty minutes had a message pop up on my screen saying that my roku was overheating. It was hot to the touch and after some research it is a common problem especially if your device is inside a cabinet which mine is but I have had an amazon fire stick in the exact same spot for a couple of years without a problem. Roku does offer an extender for free that you have to order online. Not sure why they don’t just put it in the box in the first place. The extender will only move it off the back of my home theater system a couple of inches so that probably will not help since it will still be in the cabinet. They’re only true fix for the problem is to move it to a cooler spot which is not an option for me so I’ll have to try something else.

  This was great the ability to make a dumb tv smart by plugging in this stick is superb. We can talk to it and it will open the app and find shows and show you which app. No regrets... however some improvements they could make:(1) When requesting certain titles it might show you options for purchase even though there is an option on one of the streaming services you have for free so don't trust that completely.(2) It doesn't turn off the tv with alexa or turn on the tv with alexa.(3) you have to hold the voice button to speak to it but I think you can use alexa to speak to it though alexa isn't that great at understanding and interfacing with the rokuother than that it is pretty great

  I like this Roku Stick. Bought it for my TV in the craft room and it works perfectly.Love that the remote has volume buttons and may be synced to turn TV on/off.  My Roku box in another room does not have those features.I would have given 5 stars, however, this Roku Stick did not fit the TV in the bedroom. Disappointing, due to the design of the stick being long and not flexible to fit the port on some TV's. The TV that it didn't fit has a curvature below the port and the stick and curve are not compatible. Hopefully, Roku will improve the design to allow more use. I would buy it again, after inspecting my TV for compatibility.

  I had an older model Vizio TV for the bedroom. It was not able to recognize my 5G wireless network, resulting in video problems, buffering lags, etc. Bought this little baby,plugged it in, and Wallah! Great video, no more Vizio bloatware. Immediately recognized my TV and paired remote. Took five minutes! Screen now comes up instantly with the same Roku screen from my living room TV, all my channel selections from Roku account already there. Added attraction, the remote has volume control  and muting. Old Vizio remote now retired! Highly recommend for older flat screens manufactured before 5G became available. A winner!

  Bought two of these as gifts for family members during the holidays 2020.  Batteries that came with them had an expiration date of September 2020.  Of course, we didn't notice this until after we installed them, and returned to the infrequently used TV a couple weeks later and the remote didn't work.  A week ago, we put fresh batteries in.  Remote doesn't work 7 days later.  Guess we'll try new batteries one more time...  If it fails, we'll just use the less convenient Roku app as a remote.  Didn't have these problems with 2 Rokus bought earlier in 2020.

  The stick worked great but recently it’s kicking the remote off and unpairing it. I’ve been able to unplug the roku and plug it back in and that fixed the problem, but now it’s not anymore. It’s completely useless. I’ve had this for a little over 3-4 months.

  The remote is terrible. Either it's being unresponsive or the batteries are dead.I spend half my time with a remote that just wont switch apps and I'm changing batteries about every 2 weeks.I wish xfinity would work with Fire Box, then I could toss this where it belongs.Update: I cannot possibly stress enough how much I hate this box and remote. My Fire TV box is available immediately, while I have to wait for this thing to fire up for minutes I go through batteries every couple days and half the time I have to shut off the roku box and restart to get the remote to work.I wish my cable company would get it together so I can toss this piece of crap.

  Of the various streaming devices that we have, this is our favorite. It's very affordable, it's small, it was easy to physically hook up, and easy to set up and use. It's got an extensive list of popular apps, as well as some apps we've never heard of that we plan to experiment with. Aside from the great variety of apps, what makes it a favorite for us is the remote. It fits very comfortably in the hand, the buttons have a solid tactile feel, and the button functions are sensible. There's a volume control for the TV that's very convenient, but unfortunately it doesn't have a mute button. The primary reason we didn't rate this Roku device 5 stars, however, has to do with the prolonged difficulty that we had to get the advertised $50 Sling credit from our new Roku account for a new Sling account. Roku and Sling repeatedly pointed responsibility to each other. After a week of attempting to get the credit and spending over 8 hours on the phone with both Roku and Sling, Roku ultimately rejected our claim for the credit even though we are new subscribers to both! I subsequently requested a return authorization from Amazon. After a short cooling off period, however, we decided not to give up and I'm happy to say we figured it out.

  In order to use their stick Roku demands your credit card number nor could I find a way to restrict it's use. I bought it because the Amazon Fire stick could not connect to Britbox. The Roku does that quite well but the menu and voice recognition are not quite as good as the Fire stick. Several times, it was easer to use the menu rather than voice. I do believe Roku is the absolute master of meaningless error messages. Particularly frustrating was having to enter my information five times because I kept getting, ""an error has occurred, please try again.""

  About 6 months ago my Visio TV was identified by Netflix as no longer able to support or stream Netflix, even though it had the Netflix app. I was effectively ""Cut Off"" . Once I added the Firestick to the Visio I am able to stream Netflix and a whole lot more. Sometimes technology is a good thing.

  I bought Roku units specifically because they offer the Spectrum App. Yesterday, my Spectrum App failed to load as it does from time to time, so I tried to delete and reinstall (this usually fixes the problem). The Spectrum app has disappeared from the Roku channel menu. I reached out to Roku, who absurdly told me to call Spectrum! Last time I checked, Spectrum doesn't run Roku software. If you need Spectrum, DO NOT BUY ROKU.

  This is probably my fifth or sixth ROKU!  I have loved them so much in the past that I have given them to friends.  I replaced one that I had with a Firestick and (sorry Amazon) I like the Roku better.  I just think the Roku's apps make it easier to find what you want to watch.  I do like that with the Firestick, I can just say the name of specific show and it will take me to it but the Roku is better for browsing, in my opinion.  Anyway, my old ROKU finally bit the dust.  (I've probably had it for five or six years) so I replaced it with the new ROKU.  I got one that is supposed to pick up the WIFI from lengthy distances so I'm hoping to use it in the backyard this summer. But, for now, it's in the living room all plugged in and working fine.

  Easy to set up and the interface is easy to use. However, Be aware that you will be forced to sign up for a Roku account and give them your credit card number before being allowed to use the product.  The good news is that you can remove the credit card immediately after setting up the account.  The batteries also get used up quickly and I find myself having to remove the batteries after I’m done using it.

  I like Roku because it can be used with more of my favorite apps than most others like it.  It does not cost anything to connect & use as long as you go to the Roku site not a fraudulent site; just make sure that you get your web address correct & write just exactly what the Roku app tells you to.  It has a lot of apps to use with it; most are free.  My only complaint is that most of the free apps show  so many commercials so often that it makes it very difficult to watch a show.  Also, most free apps show lower quality shows; part of the problem is some of the free apps allow just anyone (professional or not) to make movies & etc & post on the free apps so stay with top rated apps.  It offers a great selection of shows & apps so it is well worth the money. It goes great with or without cable.

  We have a HD dumb TV. This is the device I chose to upgrade our many hours a week of watching to while the many hours of quarantine of the Pandemic. This is one of the best purchases of my life. It's easy to use (fun even) and replaxes our regular remote. It has a moderate learning curve, because there are very few buttons, that have several functions. Past that it really works great. We have two homes with other dumb tvs, this device is pocket portable and  remembers what you programed so it should take your choices with you!

  The instructions were way, way way to complicated,#1...#2 You don't ask a customer to buy your product and then...after they've purchased it tell them they ""may"" need something additional to make it work!! #3 IT IS EXTORTION to sell a person a product and then...then tell them they can't operate it UNLESS THEY GIVE YOU THEIR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION!!! And, this, after they've already installed this product. NEVER AGAIN WILL I PURCHASE A ROKU PRODUCT...NEVER, NEVER, NEVER. This was a nightmare. And, you should know that... It is this kind of an experience that sours people on doing mail order. Mail order is suppose to be fun and relatively easy. And, it is problems like this that take ALL the joy out of making a purchase. I will DEFINATELY inform ALL my friends, neighbors and relatives, ect. P.S. I was ACTUALLY in tears with this thing and had to hire a television repair person to come in and help me to install it. And, another thing...THERE IS NO #800 number...NO contact number to get any help THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM...THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM!!! The second is that extortion situation I mentioned earlier here. (Who in the world writes these instructions? Doesn't anyone - a few people, at least - try out these instructions BEFORE you sell this stuff to the public? Shame on you... Shame on you all. RR

  I've been a Roku user for almost 10 years now and got this due to the integrating of the live TV features (Pluto and Sling) into a single app so they can all be combined into a cable like service but so many different services are still unsupported.I hope that eventually they get Stirr and Xumo integrated into it as well in which case I'll be more excited.  Don't get me wrong, I like the fact that Pluto and Sling are combined together into one giant cable like service, but until I see Stirr (Comet, Charge! and Dusk) along with a couple of offerings from Xumo included so that I can combine it with my favorites from Sling and Pluto, I'll be unsatisfied.

You no longer have to side load the app to be able to access HBO Max... Roku does not offer access to the HBO Max app, so if that's one of the things you're looking for the fire stick is the way to go!

  This Fire Stick is strictly for the beginner. It is very basic. I have it on my office TV so it suits its purpose but it does require you have the TV remote as well. No volume control, no off/on.

  With this device, when I power up the TV the home button on the remote does not activate the device.  I have to unplug then plug the device back in for it to recognize power and come on.  A fix for me was my Insignia TV has a USB port that I can plug the device in to so when I power up the TV the device comes on BUT usually without sound.  I usually have to unplug and plug it back in a few times in order for it to work properly.  That's too much sugar for a quarter.  If I'd not got it as a gift I'd take it back for a refund, a regular fire stick or a roku stick.

  Purchased one of these on a whim when it was on sale to upgrade an older HD TV to be able to get “Smart TV” type content. I am new to the world of streaming TV, but this seems to do the trick. I do think the features for searching for content could be better, wanted to find a comedy movie to watch and half of what was listed as comedy was not. Oh well. The stick works, the Prime video organization needs a bit of improvement.

  Using for a tv in the bedroom and is good for that.  I don't use Alexa or voice controls so can't say anything about that.  Runs most of the tv apps I use although some won't run due to a lack of Google. Probably won't bother with that since it's for the bedroom.  Easy to install and use.

  This gets a 50/50 rating. Sometimes there is no sound on any app and I have to reboot the stick often.The HOME button should be in a different place. To easy to press by accident. Otherwise is works well for all my apps that I pay for. Now I have to get used to this new update.

  I was looking for a good streaming device to upgrade my TV, i already own a google chromecast but my mother doesnt like the idea of having to use her cellphone every time with the chromecast, so we started investigating all the streaming devices: Roku, Fire sticks, etc. With such great reviews, the Alexa voice integration and the discount price of december, the FireStick won. We bought 2 , they are so fast and smooth with 15mb they work great. It is  friendly user and it is so easy to download apk files to stream also. My mom loves that she doesnt have to be looking for anything, she just tells alexa to open it. We love it, really good at a great price.

  We received the firestick as a gift only a week ago.  So far, we have been delighted with the results: easy to install and use, many choices of programs, excellent picture and sound, and easy to switch between our regular TV reception/programs, and those offered on the firestick.

  Not quite sure but  the unit overheats in my kitchen, had to replace it so I could get rid of the streaming issues that occur with this also. The box that it came in smells musty and stinks . Hopefully this on will last longer than the previous on. You might want to purchase from someone else not sure why this smells like it has been in storage for a long time.

  Absolutely love this! We bought this to replace our Roku stick that was constantly having issues. I got this in sale for $17.99. So happy I bought it! The Alexa feature is great. You don't have to spend forever trying to click each individual letter on the keyboard. Just tell Alexa and she will do all the work!

  I had an old lagging version of my smart tv.  (not so smart)So, someone suggested just getting a firestick to update.I wasn't so sure about the ""lite"" but got it anyway.  It all works very well.  I did not need the volume or tv control so this lite was the perfect fit.

  I finally broke down and bought a newer Firestick.  It's so much faster than the first generation model that I've had for several years.  I don't use the Voice, Alexa, or Volume Control features, so I can't comment on those, but this Firestick is blazing fast compared to my previous model.

  Remote stopped working five weeks after getting fire stick. Yes I did double check and make sure batteries were charged and in working order before writing this review. Voice recognition never worked once. No issues with playback, except with Hulu which from time to time states they are unable to play a title, however that’s a Hulu issue not a fire stick issue. I do love ease of use with the fire stick when it does function properly.  This is my second fire stick and I believe I will be making the switch to Roku going forward.

  HONESTLY bought the wrong one. Im used to being able to adjust my volume and turn off and on the tv with the fire stick. THIS ONE does not do either. Also very glitchy randomly stops working and it is NOT my wifi. The ""channels"" button/ feature is pointless. UPGRADING ASAP. Newest version is awesome but this one is just okay.

  This was my 2nd Firestick I purchased and is happy I did. The Firestick Lite was very easy to setup and has a lot of viewing options and app's to download.It has voice recognition which is handy when searching for a movie, music or etc.  It also has plenty of free movies and live TV to watch.I'm glad I purchased this for both TV's in my new place instead of cable  for the viewing content is was definitely worth the $.

  When it worked correctly, it was great. But the sound was erratic. Most times  I could not get any sound. Spent quite a long time with tech-support. Although the technician was helpful, she could not solve the sound problem. Amazon replaced it with a  refurbished fire stick although I did not purchase a refurbished one.  The new refurbished one has the same sound problem. I don’t think this is unique to me because when I Googled the problem, I found the sound problem to be fairly common.

  If you want to turn your HD tv into a smart tv without paying smart money this is definitely the way. I was able to order all the same apps I use on my apple phone or tablet to watch shows. Super easy to setup of connect to your tv. I’m definitely happy with this $20 purchase

  Got this for my dad, as he is considering dropping cable... he is loving it. He’s not the best with technology (at 74 years old), but he’s learning quick as it’s easy to navigate and customizable. There is a lot of free content that he’s enjoying. The voice control is a great bonus that he didn’t think he would use/like.

  This is the second Firestick that I've purchased and I'm just as pleased.  This time, I purchased the Firestick Lite and it works as expected.  Set up is a breeze and I love being able to easily choose the apps that I want.  Additionally, I appreciate the profile set up which allows you to choose shows and movies that you enjoy seeing.  The only criticism is that I wish I'd gotten the regular Firestick for this television as well since I've discovered that I like having the features of the tv buttons (like volume, etc) on one remote.  However, this is simply a personal preference and does not impact the quality of this product.

  I purchased this unit for use on an older 32 inch TV in my kitchen, and it is just fine. Doesn't need a lot of bells and whistles as the TV doesn't have them either. I bought this to replace an older first generation Fire Stick which doesn't work well at all anymore on any TV. It works great.

  This is a time saver.I use to connect my TV to my laptop using HDMI but boy it was hell when I had to get up and change the movie or turn up the volume. With this remote my TV is like a smart TV. The voice commands work pretty well considering it's not the most advanced. Changing movies and turning up/down the volume of the tv has never gotten easier. Even surfing the wen has got interesting but the screen of my TV does not properly support that.

  Incredible price, tons of mostly free content, very fast and now that I have Amazon Prime I am watching tons of free movies with no commercial interruptions. All I needed was a hot spot. I do have a no data cap and no throttling hot spot that assures me I will not run out of data when using my hot spot for streaming movies.

  This edition of Fire stick is a piece of crap...I get this message every time I try to use it. I guess it’s because it the cheapest version.

  I found it very simple to set up. The one thing that I really don't like is the length of the cord. It's too short for the tv that I bought it for; I plugged it into the surge protector on the floor and it doesn't reach the HDMI port on the tv. I honestly considered returning it for that reason because I needed it specifically for that tv. In theory, it would've worked well, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars.Edit: I’ve changed my review from 4 stars to 3. Every other time I turn on my tv, it says no signal even though the fire stick is plugged in. I have to unplug it and plug it back in.

  The WiFi chip in our TV stopped working so this was an easy way to restore wireless connection to our modem.  Haven't figured out how to use Alexa smoothly yet, and was confusing which remote control to use the TV or Amazon Fire TV remote.  When I switch to watch a DVD using the TV remote it quickly shifts to the Fire TV connection requiring me to re-select the DVD source.  But, overall am happy with it.

  We've had a Fire stick for several years. Ordered one from Cyber Monday and wow, Amazon doesn't disappoint. I thought the early edition was pretty amazing, but this one is even better. Love being able to talk into the remote and having Alexa search all of the streaming services to find what I'm asking for. Highly recommend!

  This is my second one. I like it. It’s easy to set up but the plug is too short and it doesn’t reach the outlet. I had to purchase an extension cord to plug it into an outlet.  Just make sure you don’t overload the outlet it can and will cause a fire. This is the only set back.

  It's been almost a month I've used this thing, and I'm beginning to see the idiosyncracies. Some apps. take a while to download (the little spinning circle ?), but if it doesn't get worse it's ok. My thinking is you don't get something for nothing, so they get you one way or another. I get 14 Mb. down so I'm thinking thats fast enough for one tv. I'm also ditching my DirecTV as AT&T have taken over and are raping customers. I'll put up a roof antenna and point it at Mpls/St Paul. I should be in range, and with this rig I can quit supporting the Parasites.

  I needed to purchase an updated streaming device, after five years, to access Hulu.  My Blu ray player and Wii, though they still work fine and access other media services, were no longer compatible with Hulu's format.  I purchased this particular Roku streaming stick because it came with a voice remote that also controls TV power and volume.  I can access all my TV apps in one place, which is what I needed.  Roku also provides movies and classic TV shows, at no additional charge.I would have given 5 stars for the ""user interface,"" if not for the inconvenience of the incompatibility of the streaming stick with my TV (shown in photo).  I had to wait two extra days to receive an adaptor, to use it.  Upon request, Roku does provide an adaptor at no cost, and they shipped it the same day I requested it.

  2.5 stars1 point off for it’s dated looking interface.  Slugish compared to the ultra Roku. Huge negative is it actually has a huge ad on the main home screen. Guess they saw amazon was getting away with it, so they started doing it too.Blows away the Amazon sticks IMO. The amazon stick is all about shoving prime, ads, and amazon down your throats. Between the two, go roku for sure. Personally I'd either get the Roku ultra, or the cheapest Roku available. This product isn't really any faster than the cheaper models

  Great purchase! I’m thoroughly enjoying using my Roku. No connectivity issues and it was simple to install. Primarily I use it for my Xfinity cable box solution. After speaking with an Xfinity rep she mentioned that I wouldn’t be responsible for renting the 2 extra cable boxes I was going to pay $10 more each for. That’s $20 plus tax monthly. Now I can watch all my cable stations on the Xfinity app plus this is portable.  After downloading the Xfinity App on my Roku I also did the same on my iPhone. Anyway the 2 Roku’s will pay for themselves in a few months. Much easier to use than my Firestick. Loving the 1 click Hulu and Netflix buttons. Lastly my iPhone is also a remote control since I utilized the Roku app. If you’re on the fence don’t be. I highly recommend.

  Can’t say if it works or not. I ordered the basic  Roku on 11/26 and it arrived on 11/29. Went to set it up on my new Vizio tv so we could watch Disney + and it only fits the side facing hdmi port. But, we got a message indicating hdcp error. Roku says I can get a FREE dongle to access the other ports on the tv so I ordered it right away on 11/29. It is now 12/5, the mail has arrived, no dongle. We missed watching Disney+ last weekend and now it’s looking like we will miss another weekend. Funny thing is it worked on a small older Panasonic tv we had but watching on the small tv kind of defeated the purpose. I’m very disappointed.Update: The dongle arrive in the mail today. It worked so hurray.... a week later.

  My old roku bit the dust so I needed a new one. Other models were cheaper but I decided to go with this one because of the all in one remote (I was tired of having a roku remote and a tv remote to turn on the TV and adjust the volume).  It all works great. The stick is plugged in behind the TV but we have no trouble changing the channels and adjusting volume which is such an improvement over our older version that you had to make sure you had a clear line of site and point it exactly right.I have only owned this for a month or 2 but I am very happy with my purchase.

  This Roku is a great device but the remote has a big problem , it drains the batteries even when not in use and you need to be replacing batteries almost every week or every two weeks , I have bought 4 of them and all of them have the same problem.

  Bought three of these after abandoning our pricey satellite TV.  Have found in general that the Rokus work well, though they are quite prone to locking up, meaning they need to be rebooted 1-2 times per week.  That is frustrating but acceptable considering I’m saving a bunch of money by ditching the satellite. Streaming quality is variable, from super high resolution to glitchy and pixelated but that is more to do with our bandwidth and my gaming son than the Roku. Overall I like the ROku and would buy it again

  Never realized there was another TV world out there.  I am amazed and surprised that there are thousands of streaming channels available there are, with ones that I truly want to watch!  You just plug in The Stick+ to an open HDMI port on your TV, set up the wireless network, and voila, streaming!Stick+ internal menus are very easy to understand and maneuver. Simple but effective remote control without 2000 buttons makes for effortless viewing options. You do have a short learning curve on installing ""private"" channels, getting the codes that recognize your stick+, but really easy once you have registered a couple of channels.I am a recently retired TV Cable technician, and if my customers knew about how nifty and neat this product was, there would have been less TV Cable customers.  Very satisfied and can't wait for the weekly channel releases for literally ""anything"" you want to watch...

  Without bad-mouthing other streaming devices manufactured to lesser standards, this one is the genuine article by which all others will forever be judged. After experience with Roku for 15 years or so, I've flirted with a little 'strange' now and again. I apologized and reconciled with my reliable streaming brand: Roku. No device is perfect, but for my money, this brand pays serious attention to manufacture quality. This remote feels the best in your hand, and the receiver holds onto signals better than rival brands.

  Roku's interface is by far the best, in my opinion, and the ease of use is so good i can even put then throughout my parent's house.  If you have any 4K setup and you need a streaming stick this one fits the bill.  Set-up is a cakewalk with the Roku interface walking you through your options.  We've owned the standard streaming sticks but this one comes with a remote that lets you control your tv's volume (only works with the TV's volume not a separate soundbar which we have)  It would be nice if they allowed control of other sound devices.  The remote also has a voice search feature that i found myself using more and more to search for movies or shows i want to watch instead of scrolling through an endless list of media.  Overall this is a great streaming stick, and if you're looking to upgrade to a 4k stick this one is the one to get.

  Cutting the cord is the single best thing we have done to save money in a long time! Our traditional cable bill was $350 and we cut it in half buying the Roku stick and going with Hulu Live and Netflix.I'm absolutely impressed with everything about the Roku stick. Easy to setup and install, easy to navigate, easy to add, delete, and change channel apps, works great on our medium speed wifi, have had almost no streaming issues at all, and the couple of issues we did have could have been the apps we were watching.It has been such a big hit in the house all the kids want one in their room now. If you're thinking of cutting the cord, Roku is definitely the way to go!

  Trying to set up the stick with Amazon video was a hassle. It did not let us download the app even when going online as others have tried to so don't recommend it if you have Amazon prime. I wanted to give them a chance because they are less advertise on their streaming device unlike the fire stick but honestly it wasn't worth our trouble so I went with a fire stick from Amazon.  With the Amazon fire stick we also had a small issue signing in to my Amazon prime account. I had to call customer service and they did it for me somehow but now it streams well on our projector and we couldn't be happier

  I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick+ to replace an Amazon Fire Stick for our basement TV. The Fire Stick was able to detect both my 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks, but did not work reliably when connected to the 5 GHz network. I decided to try the Roku device based upon the supposed high sensitivity receiver. The result was the Roku does not even detect the 5 GHz network. It has been working okay with the 2.4 GHz network, but as we spend more time in our workout area in the basement, I don't believe I will have good enough bandwidth at 2.4 GHz to stream 4K content. This is somewhat of a minor issue overall, however. I like the remote and simple UI that the Roku has, which is really beneficial for my wife since she is not the most tech savvy person. The downloadable app options are enormous.I would say that the Roku device, despite the inability to make use of my 5 GHz network, is an upgrade over my old Amazon Fire Stick.

  It's easy to set up. There are YouTube vids if you want to go that route. I had a bit of trouble at first using it with my Panasonic plasma TV, but I got it figured out. You will need an internet connection to use this, of course.UPDATE:  Dropped this to 2 stars from 5. The Roku has developed a serious audio to video lag on most of the apps (channels) I get. Evidently, this is a problem for a LOT of users. There are some apps where this is not - or barely - noticeable, but Amazon Prime is terrible. The audio is at least a half second behind the video, sometimes more. Resetting the Roku hasn't helped. The Roku forums don't help much either.

  This was a Prime Day Deal that I decided to splurge on to replace my existing Roku 3 which has the tendency to randomly power off. The Roku Streaming Stick + has been rock solid. Plug & Play. Launches fast, solid streaming. The dependability of this unit has me one step closer to cutting the cord on cable.This is a five-star product that I only gave 4-stars so that readers would know that I am a real user of the product and not one of the way-too-many on Amazon who give 5-star reviews in exchange for payment or free product.

  We have gone to all Streaming TV. The Roku system is the greatest as it makes available & gives you control of all Streaming Programs that you desire to use. Some programs are free, some charge a monthly fee. You choose. The only cost is for the Roku units for each TV.  Roku also has a movie channel that’s free. The Roku Streaming Stick can be used on any TV as your traveling!!! We dumped the high cost AT&T, Direct TV to our own desired programs. We added Spectrum internet services with no limit as to the # of TV’s & Spectrum Mobile with unlimited phone calls or texts. Get on board to the Streaming World and save money; see exactly what you want when you want...

  We had 5 tv's connected to ROKU Expresses; we were very pleased with the service, but experienced occasional sustained buffering. After looking into options, we decided to upgrade one tv with a ROKU Stick to allow us to put it on a separate 5G network.  It has solved our problem (so far) and we LOVE the ROKU remote with all the upgraded features.  Happy Campers in Georgia:)

  I bought this unit 10/10/18 and it worked fine until around 7/10/19 (9 months) then had chronic problems as follows: the remote would not communicate with the Roku stick and when it did it was so slow you never knew when it would respond.  I contacted Roku CS on 7/13/19 and they said they would replace it with another unit after I return my bad unit first.  It took more than a week to receive another one which after several months had similar problems as the first unit.  In November of 2019 I bought an Amazon Fire-stick on sale for around $15,  The Roku cost was $60 when purchased.  I kept the Roku by mistake and today (3/19/20) decided to try it again just in case it might work again ""Hope over experience"" but it doesn't.  My Fire-stick works great but there were some apps that were on the Roku I liked that are not available on the Fire-stick albeit not really important.  I would not recommend this Roku to anyone who would be considering it.

  Not perfect, it has the occasional server lag (could be my internet, but I doubt it - based on the type of lag behavior and the fact I get about 50mbps), but these are rare and momentary occurrences.I enjoy the home screen functionality a great deal. The user interface is VERY functional and offers a wealth of viewing information right from the moment you power up (which takes only 2 seconds).Indefinitely recommend if you want a smart tv (without replacing the tv you already have).

  How or why would you make a device without an on and off button or volume button.  Had to use a separate remote for the volume.  Contacted Amazon about it and it also wouldn’t connect for us.  Went back to the original firestick which we love.  This lite version is horrible.

  This device is an absolute champion of streaming entertainment.  The streaming stick plus is a compact marvel that deftly handled everything I've thrown at it with aplomb.The roku stick plus is a breeze to set up.  The entire process took less than 3 minutes, including adding controls for my television's power and volume (how awesome is that!!)The stick plus pushed 4k content to my TV with nary a hiccup despite being 3 rooms over and two floor up from my router.  Excellent wifi reception... No other device even comes close (I have a difficult time connecting any if my tablets to wifi in that room).The interface couldn't be easier. Everything is laid out intuitively.  And I love the holiday themed backgrounds... Wonderful touch, ROKU!I've had numerous roku devices from every generation.  As I've upgraded, I gave my old devices to family and friends.  I've helped to build our own little roku fan club. Now I just need to get 1 more streaming stick plus and I can pass along my last gen devices to needy tech-challenged family members!

  Roku is easy to install and the remote is so simple and uncomplicated. I switched from Directv to Directv Now and, after reading several reviews, decided on Roku Streaming stick + because of my 2K/5K router. I've noticed no difference in picture quality and I don't have to be bothered with losing the feed due to weather as I used to with Directv. I've converted all of my TV's to Roku SS+ and it has been well worth it. With the $90/month I'm saving by going to Directv Now the payback will only be 2 months. Roku also offers Acorn TV which is great if you're into foreign television (the stuff you usually see on PBS.)

  If you have family members who don't deal well with change, this is for you.  You choose what services you want.  Some are pay services, many are not.  As someone who doesn't like the idea of machines listening to me, the voice function of this product only works when you press the microphone button.  I've come to really enjoy this feature.  I suggest you try it.  I uttered ""acoustic guitar"", and it brought up talk shows, documentaries and even free guitar lessons.  Explore the different free services.  There's a Three Stooges app that includes Abbott and Costello and many other old shows I fell in love with as a child.  Yes, I'm dating myself, which should also tell you how easy this system is to use.  I suggest plugging in the power module instead of using a USB plug on the TV.  That saves you the time of boot up each time you turn on the TV.  My wife now favors streaming.

  I am very happy with this unit.  I also bought another one for my girlfriend.  The voice command works fine.  The amount of available programs that can be streamed is amazing.  Picture quality is great...and it works with my 5.1 system.  Once I add one more to my kitchen TV I will be ready give the boot to my satellite TV system.

  Despite a little bit of a headache to first set-up, especially with trying to get the device to be recognized properly, in which I had to use Roku's on-line chat to correct the issue, once the unit was set up it works beautifully. This particular unit is in our upstairs master bedroom, and our router is on the first floor, but there is zero lag in streaming and  the picture and sound are sharp and clear. I was so happy with it that I picked up the Roku Express for our living room.I have not yet experimented with voice control, but I can see an obvious value to it. On the other hand, having the one-source TV viewable link to connect all my streaming services is amazing and well worth the cost and initial effort.

  Perfect, exactly what I needed and couldn't be happier. I have different model Roku devices around my house but never got a stick before. This is plugged right into my projector and works as good as my 4k ultra Rokus do. Steam is solid, the stick is responsive and it's pulling an excellent rating from my wifi across the house. I have it plugged into my HDMI port and powered by the USB so no extra wires hanging around to plug into the wall. Now I can move the projector around and have movie night in any room or outdoors... Plus I can stream to the stick like you can with any Roku from my desktop computer so I can do halloween and soon Christmas projections in my window. Simply choose from the bottom right of your start bar the project or connect feature and choose this Roku product. Love it.

  We have an older model of a Google tv - initially it was great when it was one of the first smart tvs available.  Over time the apps started falling off.  Google no longer supported Amazon streaming, so we bought an Amazon Fire Stick.  That was great and it extended our ability to enjoy more channels.  We also are big fans of YouTube, especially for music video streaming.  Recently it was announced that YouTube is no longer available on the Fire Stick, so we bought the Roku Streaming Stick.  WOW!!!!  Not only are there so many more options, the video quality of our older model smart tv has improved dramatically.  Maybe someday we'll buy a newer model smart tv, but for now this Roku addition has made a world of difference to our entertainment equipment.

  Purchased this on Black Friday for $29.  It's for use in my office so I didn't want to pay Comcast another $10 monthly premium for a box that I will hardly use, but I was concerned I wouldn't get all the channels and features.  Hooked it up last week and WOW!  I can't pause/rewind live TV, but I can view every channel I've wanted to so far, I can view all of my recordings...does the job and then some!  I will be swapping out a few more cable boxes in my house to ROKU boxes...even at $49 I'll pay for them in just a few months.  Netflix and Prime Video also work very well as does Pandora...which has a very cool interface by the way.  Very pleased with the ROKU service...

  I have 4 Roku +'s. Interface IMO is better than ANY smart TV or Fire Stick. Roku is the preeminent streaming engine and all of the Content Streamers make sure that their Apps work with them. I have never had a software problem. The only complaint is their Remote w/TV power and volume where getting it to work is a crapshoot. It works with TV Speaker volume but not with any name soundbar except apparently Roku's own sounder. The on/off power intermitant so keep your TV Remote close  as you will need it.Save yourself the $$ and aggravation and buy HD Roku Stick w/the basic remote. Roku should fix their remote problems or stop marketing a product so deficient.

  I bought this to go on my 4K TV and the picture is great. Wish there was more 4K content but that will come in time. Easy to use and configure. The remote has an earphone jack on it which is so cool if you are in bed and your partner wants to sleep while you watch TV in bed. Tons of apps and I see more every month. Works will with YouTube, YouTubeTV, NetFlix, Hulu, Spotify, Amazon Prime Video,  Intune-In Radio, Siruis XM Radio an many others.

  Very few issues with streaming quality and like the way the home page is organized.  Love the movie trailers that play automatically when movie is highlighted.  Alexa search works well too.One issue is that if a movie is paused for more than few minutes, the screen goes to back to the main menu or somewhere and I have to search again for the movie I was just watching.Finally, Amazon could try to get regional sports networks apps to add.  The streaming services can't do it or don't have contracts with those networks.

  This is my 4th fire stick for a 4th tv in the house. I am not sure why but with the last one purchased I have had to re-set it 3 times by simply unplugging it and plug it back in. I have only had to do this on this last stick. The other three have not needed this. The three re-sets were over about a months time.

  My 4th one, all working, I've learned to appreciate them for for what they are, was a long life satellite TV watcher and satellite installer, so it was a change and adjustment, I'm paying a fourth of what my bill use to be, is it better than satellite? Nope, but it's more than adequate if TV is important to you.

  I don’t like this version. If I go to the kitchen and grab something, when I come back, this stick has backed all the way out of my show and the app I was watching it in and it’s back at the Home Screen. It also doesn’t have DCUniverse or Peacock. I also couldn’t download my favorite virtual church app either. Roku is better now

  The fire stick - easy install, easy operation and the application worked very well with my home system. The draw back; I found my data usage from streaming went way up. The packages offered in my area data caps are #1 - $40.00 for 350GB, #2 -$65.00 for 700GB and #3 - $75.00 for 1200GB. In other localities 1TB is the data cap start point.  This alone made staying with Direct TV more affordable.

  I bought this product because it claimed to have the HBOMAX app on it.

  The fire stick did not work properly. I couldn't install any channel. When I tried to get a new channel, a windows appeared that said ""app not found"".

I tried resetting it, free storage space, uninstalling ad block apps ...I previously had a roku (which I had no issue with) and I am now going back with it.

  Good budget option for older TVs with HDMI to stream. Contrary to internet searching, Spectrum does not stream on it. Otherwise it is ok. I do have to restart mine often. Not sure if it is a bad unit or bad choice. I don't use it a whole lot to complain about it much.

  Love the Roku, hate the remote. The batteries are dead every time we pick the remote up. Looking at specific battery related reviews, people have replaced replaced the remote and had the same problem. So, I guess we will pull out batteries after each use. Grrrr. This seems like the stupidest design flaw.

  I bought one of these Roku Streaming Stick+ devices for a technically-incompetent friend, and she's continue to use it and reports no problems.I bought another one of these for my mother -- someone who's just technical enough to mess up anything that's been pre-set with her most-used options, and she was able to use the Roku without error.I'd definitely buy another Roku Streaming Stick+, when the need arises.  It's much easier to use than certain other content streaming dongles from a certain worldwide online sales organization.

  This is the answer to the Cable companies finding new ways to rip you off by charging rent on their boxes. Spectrum and Hawaii TelComm are in Kahouts or they are together in price fixing. Both come out same time changing their systems and the pricing is the exact same. They want to charge $10 a box a month which seems minute until you times it by the 5 television sets, and this is ontop of the $160 they charge monthly. You have to go through a few steps and it takes a little while to get used too but it is worth it.  $50 a stick for 5 TVs comes out to $250 one time or rent at $10 a box for 5 TVs and pay $600 a year.  Plus with Roku you get a lot more channels and free movies.

  I finally got it running.  Once it's in, it's great.  But I found it very difficult to install.  The whole process seems to be oriented towards capturing your subscription.  it took me a while, and a lot of searching on the internet to figure out how to initialize it without using my credit card for Roku subscriptions.

  Bought this because I saw many reviews stating that this was the best streaming device with the best interface The interface is OK and the device as a whole is  just OK but there are a decent amount of unexpected downsides Voice control is not supported on most applications including YouTubeWhen it does work it works very poorly The streaming stick and remote often get very hotIt randomly causes my TV to turn on and off for no reason A decent amount of buffering when watching videos even though the device is right next to my router and I have very good Internet After about two minutes of me not using the remote it turns off completely and takes about 30 seconds to turn back on which can be annoying when trying to watch YouTube videos or quickly pause This could be a feature to save battery but I haven’t found a way to turn it off if it is

  Cuando me llegó el dispositivo a finales de julio de 2020, realicé la instalación y todo funcionó perfectamente, hasta hace una semana que el roku no encendió más, me comunique con el distribuidor que convenientemente me informó que la garantía era de tres meses y que ya no cubría el servicio, me comuniqué con el servicio técnico de Roku y me informan que no atienden casos de dispositivos que son comprados en un país diferente al enviado. Me pregunto entonces porque venden este dispositivo a otros países si no van a solucionar los problemas que se presentan, me resulta muy discriminatorio y conveniente para ellos. En fin, no compren este dispositivo, si se les daña y son de un país diferente a EEUU no les van a responder.

  I’m a big Roku person, been using them for years. I have two Ultra’s currently and after picking up a new 50” TV recently that I am going to mount on a wall mount I needed another streaming device. I originally picked up a Firestick 4K but I just can’t get all the apps I want without having to use some hacky 3rd party sideloaded apps that are buggy, so I returned that and picked up this Streaming Stick+. So far I’ve used it for several hours and haven’t had any issues with it, it’s zippy and steams 4K on all the major apps flawlessly. I haven't tested the voice integration as that’s not really my thing.Unless you need the external connections the Ultra offers, I’d suggest picking up a Streaming Stick+ instead and save yourself $50 or more dollars!

  Two units and both had issues with the remote.  The remote kills the batteries after a short time.  Now that I am past the Amazon return window by just a few days, I am stuck dealing with Ruko who won’t speak to a live customer.  I have to go through email.  Not happy!  Other than the issue with the remote, the actual streaming device works fine.

  Works better than the older version. I have no problem connecting to wireless WiFi in my bed rm. WiFi is downstairs and there’s no buffering or connecting issues so far. I’ve been using it for a month. My only negative would be there no main Amazon button they put Disney plus as one replacing the Amazon shortcut. I bought it so I could watch Discovery plus seeing it’s not currently on Amazon. My smart TVs would download the app for some reason?? But I’m enjoying it and it functions!

  I had an ancient Roku which was great for many years but I noticed it was slow to load programs or didn't load them at all. I thought it was my internet so ordered this model with the internet boost feature and what a world of difference, it works like the tv that sits next to the wifi modem. Quick, efficient, no lag time and the newer features are A+, very happy with this purchase and wish I would have thought to do it long ago!

  Garbage.  Remote barely worked for a couple months.  Had to keep hitting the buttons repeatedly to get any response, even after checking the batteries with DMM, & trying fresh batteries.  Stick kept freezing up, meaning that the stream would stop & continuously clock, wouldn’t connect to the network, wouldn’t load a channel or app & kept saying that there wasn’t enough space to launch an app.  Tried resetting to factory new settings & setting up fresh again.  Works once or twice & goes back to all the same issues.  Completely useless!!!

  The added antenna is definitely worth it.  I couldn't use the usb plug in the tv because it didn't push enough juice for the antenna so grabbed a space usb adapter for a wall plug.  I've had mine for a few years and the only rear issue I've  had and it's lately is that it seems to be loosing the volume on occasion.  The trick seems to be to unplug it and let it cool off because it's fine afterwards.  I was able to bend the tip a little being careless with them back of the tv but it still works.I even bought two more of these for my parents and they're happy with them too.

  I'm 65 a just had both knees totally replaced the hardest part was climbing up on a ladder. Oh one thing worth mentioning is the stick itself was underneath the packaging. The way it pulls out in the tray it appears that everything is in the plastic tray. It's not pull the packaging out completely because hiding down underneath the packaging is the stick itself. Once I got that far it was easy peasy from that point on. It will be for you too.Don't let some grandma show you up. Stop whining and set up your Roku yourself. Then you'll feel good about accomplishing the hook-up all on your own. So if someone complains to you about watching TV in the middle of the day tell them ""I deserve it cause I just set up the Roku all by myself."" Then make the motion of dusting your self off - with a big grin on your face.

  excellent compared to the two older models of Roku I dealt with first for my mom starting 2010 or 12 & 2016 the speed is very good on the menu and it looks better or is setup a little different somehow I am a 36 year computer geek/tech and I can honestly say I love it, I was using my ps3 for my streaming media but when I ran across a professional review for this in a comparison format I decided to get it especially for this price $45.36 so if you have an hd TV (doesn't have to be smart) with a USB port for convenience of power source (not a necessity) I highly recommend this Roku  you will not be disappointed

  I replaced an aging roku with this model.The speed that it loads as opposed to the older one is drastic this one loads fast, at 4kThe quality is superior, I'm very happy with it.He only downsize it's because it's a stick and it doesn't have an infrared remote sensor my TV remote won't control it.

  Works great with the Xfinity app and all of the standard apps. For some reason it dosen't have a regular YouTube app, but none of these are perfect. Compared to a fire stick this is a hundred miles ahead of it as far as the interface, apps, remote and overall usability.My only complaint is that you can't get a remote with numbers on it. That makes using the xfinity app a little challenging because you can't go directly to the channel you want, but if you setup favorite channels it isn't so bad.

  I had a Roku 2XS connected to the TV we use with our treadmill. While the unit served its purpose, it was time to upgrade. The streaming via WiFi was getting slow and some apps like YouTube kept crashing. While the operating system was up to date, the Roku 2XS was just not up to the task.I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick+ | 4K/HDR/HD as an upgrade since it supported HD and Wireless N/5ghz.Since I already have a Roku account, setup was easy and the unit picked up our faster Wireless N signal from our router.The streaming was fast and the apps are updated and don’t crash compared to the Roku 2XS.The remote is great. It detected our TV resolution and it can power on/off the TV and control the volume. Since the Roku is plugged into the HDMI port behind the TV, it also doesn’t need to be in the line of sight as with most infrared controllers.The output on the display is nice and the Roku auto-detected the TV outputs 1080p.Treadmill workouts are now great with the newer Roku, and I’m happy with the upgrade!

  When the device works it is awesome. However, over the last 3-4 months it has continuously gotten worse. A couple times a month it will lose connectivity entirely - which will require me to reboot it. Upon reboot it freezes over and over and over when trying to access the network settings to reconnect to my internet.I’ve talked to customer support twice - the first time they told me to just hard reboot it. Which works. But also kicks me out of all my services and requires me to sign in, over and over and over again. Not scalable or a great user experience.The second time, after hours of troubleshooting, they agreed to replace it as faulty. Except they want me to send it to them, and pay for shipping, and wait while they validate the issue, after which they’ll ship me a replacement in 3-5 business days. After 30 minutes or arguing they decided I was a valuable enough customer to issue me a replacement “in advance” and I can send them back the faulty one.Terrible experience with them as a company. Just pay the extra money and get an Apple TV 4K so you never have to worry about quality, customer service, or wasting hours of your life troubleshooting these things.

  The Roku is the BEST way to go to make it possible to have a streaming app or opportunity that your device may not have automatically or included. For example, if your a Spectrum customer, to have their app available to your TV (especially on older TVs, but even on NEWER ones too). It also gives you the opportunity to get other, more mainstream apps, that didn't come installed on your DVD, BluRay, DVR, or other devices. Like for people looking to get the Apple+ or Disney+ features. Not ALL apps might be available though, at the current time - but the option is possible because the Roku gives you the option.

  We don't use Alexa...by choice...for privacy/security.We do love this Roku tho. Lots of research to find the right one for our needs. This was plug and play set up for our older Vizio TV to get rid of Spectrum box. It's already on the app, which isn't the case for the Amazon streaming version product. Wished we'd have bought Roku first ffg or simplicity of set up. Bought more for other TVs. Happy with the higher PPI and ease of remote. No bulky remotes or rabbit ears any longer. A great bonus!

  I can't get over the Fire TV. It's so versatile. The music selections are so cool. Amazon Prime Video streams flawlessly. There are so many possibilities. The only saving grace are all of the music channels that help me get to sleep once I can pull myself away from experimenting with all the various apps. And  Alexa  is educating me on various actor bios after seeing them in a movie.  As is probably evident, I'm darned excited about my new  toy. Thanks Amazon!

  After using my original Stik for several years, I was pleasantly surprised at the increased speed of the newer generation  Fire TV Stik. The processor speed is what I think makes the difference. This one loads the Apps much quicker. I opted to not go with the HD version because I live in a rural setting that is not served by broadband, only cellular based internet. I doubt that the large providers will ever consider us worthwhile to provide service to. But, this new Stik serves our needs and works very well at the speeds we have. Thank you Amazon.

  There is nothing bad to say about Amazon Fire Stick Lite.  The set up was easy.  Plug it into HDMI port, log in with Amazon account, and wait for it to update.  That's basically it.  The only thing that is slightly negative is that there is no way to lower the volume level of the fire stick.  Other than that, I love it.  Wish I had purchased it sooner but better late then never.  Thank you, Amazon, for turning my TV into entertainment central! 😊👍🏻

The next day I went to purchase it and the sale was gone, the code I was given one day earlier did not work and the fire stick 4K was only available for $39.99 which was outside of my budget. The Firestick lite was on sale for $21.99 so I purchased it. The very next day; after the lite was delivered, I was given the advertisement for the 4K stick for the $29.99 again. I was very dissapointed as I would’ve rather had the 4K instead of the lite. Lite works ok but dissapointed with the Amazon service and discount issues.

  The remote control is deceptively simple and user-friendly - not too many buttons, for a change - BUT why did a designer think putting controls on the SIDE of the remote, instead of on top with all the other buttons,  was a good idea?  I did not see the side-located buttons, and did not feel them with my  aging hands, and could not figure out why my television was mysteriously muted then not, and volume going up or down without cause. Then I accidentally saw the side-located buttons, and viola! the mystery was solved!  Stupid, stupid location for those critical controls!  But I will live with it.  The television seems fine, and if it serves for years I will be very happy.

  I bought this as a replacement for my old Fire stick that stopped working, it was the very first one released, so it was about time to upgrade.  Love the voice command.  It's a lot easier to use than going to every letter with the remote when searching for a show to watch.

  I had been streaming over my TV via a laptop for over a decade and it was good but the RUKU will stream 4K on my TV and that made a wonderful difference. Glad I got it. Plus it opened up the door for other things to watch, even though I usually only watch things in the evening if I choose to. I still miss having my connection to other things I watched on my laptop though.

  We've gone through more batteries on this remote than what we've paid for it.  I've reached out to customer service, which by the way is NOT an 800 number so you can't talk to an individual, and am waiting to hear back from them.  From searching online, I see that this is a known issue, but I don't see any type of resolution online.  I will update this when I hear back from ROKUUPDATE:  ROKU has contacted me and advised that I plug the USB port into the wall outlet and to not just use the television as the power source.  That appears to be working now so I am upping the rating to 3 stars.

  The unit is handy to use but there is no way to shut it off. therefore it drains batteries continually, every 4-5 days???Another disappointment: everything you watch comes with loads of commercials. ??  It is relatively easy to setup but the way it eats batteries is ridicules.  With my apple tv, I only changed once a year at most.

  This works great but has an issue.  I first connected this using the TV USB port and that was a huge failure.  Went through batteries in a day or two.  Dropped my issue into GOOGLE and found this to be a known problem.  Stopped using the USB port to power the unit in favor of a wall plug and my troubles went away.  Unfortunately, using the electric plug for me is not a clean installation.  I have a second wire to look at and I specifically purchased this unit to prevent this kind of connection.

  The  Roku Streaming Stick + does a very good job at streaming long range. The stream quality is better than my older Firestick.  One major drawback is that I wanted to used it to stream broadcast live TV from my HDHomerun Prime.  I cannot see all the broadcast channels, only a few. My older Firestick can play all the channels streaming from my HDHomerun Prime. I contacted both Roku support and Silicon Dust support about this issue and found out that  the Roku was designed to play web streaming video and does a good job of that but broadcast/cable TV only works for some at all because of some overlap between the formats it uses and one of the streaming formats and also that broadcast TV does other things that streaming doesn't, then it will not play. This differs with each Roku model. Hopefully this will be examined further and one can hope for a fix in the future.

  UPDATE: As you can see from my original review, I was very happy with Roku after my first purchase. I continued to be happy for well over a year when I starting having problems with the Roku screen freezing when I transferred from my Directv to the Roku stick. The problem persisted until I finally decided to buy a newer stick, thinking it would, of course, clear up the problem. Unfortunately, the setup on the newest purchase (just last week) did not go well. Lots of things went wrong, but I finally got it up and working...until I realized I couldn't sign in to my Showtime account, which is purchased through Roku. After being on customer service chat for at least an hour, they finally gave me a fix. And then...a day after that, I started experiencing the exact same problem with the remote--it freezes when I pull up Roku. The only fix I've found is to unplug the unit, plug it back in, take out the batteries, and pair the remote with the TV again. Nope. I've contacted Roku again. If they're not able to offer a real fix, I'm returning the stick. This appears to be a known issue (read the one star reviews). Why in the world isn't Roku fixing this?!ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using an Amazon Fire Stick for several years, and, though I love Amazon, I was never totally happy with it as a media device. It was very limited and balky, and in recent months it needed to be rebooted every time I wanted to use it.I'd heard good things about Roku, so I grabbed this at a great deal. It works like a dream! It' much more intuitive and user-friendly than the Amazon Fire Stick (which has now been relegated to a less-used TV).I heartily recommend this device. You won't regret it.

  Easy set up and use. Bought the Roku stick as our ""Smart TV"" was not so smart anymore! Able to subscribe to more streaming services which is the main reason for buying!Did my research between the Roku stick and Amazon Firestick. Everyone I talked to that had both, recommended the Roku stick over Amazon Firebox or Firestick. Even the comments I got from people who had one or the other recommended the Roku stick!

  I have both Fire Stick and now Roku. Sorry Amazon, Roku is wayyyyy better. Remote is so nice and so much easier to use than the Fire Stick. I am in my fifties and want a easy to use, nice remote. Streaming service is also much more user friendly. I am really happy with this purchase and rarely write reviews. Wanted to put my two cents in on this one. Five Solid Stars.

  I had been puzzled why so few of the newer 4k products (DVD players, TVs, projectors, etc) won't allow you to add new streaming apps--or if they do, it can be very difficult.  So, when I discovered this little unit for just under $40, I was very happy. Playback is nice and sharp, and audio quality is also superb. It's also very user friendly--easy to navigate and find what you're looking for, and installation couldn't be easier.

  Amazon Fire tv is just awesome!  I've had it on my smart TV for a few years and don't know why I didn't put it on my non-smart tv in the bedroom.  I finally did and it turned my non-smart tv into a smart tv.  Now, I can turn on relaxing music to go to sleep by and get everything else I get on the big living room tv.  Awesome, awesome device and it's only twenty something dollars!

  The apps are much smaller with the new layout and make is hard to see. As always with the fireTV, very hard to read the blurbs for shows, font cannot be enlarged. Accessibility magnifier works, but is frustrating that it greatly enlarges just one portion of the screen. Would prefer that you could just enlarge font.

  Was very disappointed in the picture quality after I installed the firestick lite, dark harder to see images, some blurring in the picture quality, had higher expectations because my older firestick worked so well. Figured this one would surpass the older one in quality.

  I appreciate being able to “recycle” my older TV by making it smart instead of buying a smart TVS. This device took a total of 10-15 minutes to setup including logging into a few of my favorites applications such as Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. They provide exact steps to follow on the screen in order to be efficient with your time, allowing the option to login with another device instead of typing in the login info using the remote. The voice activation is also handy for someone who’s not good at typing one letter at a time with the remote. For someone who isn’t too tech savvy, this was very easy to use!

  Works great but as I was setting this up as a gift for my father in law on my own tv, once I removed the fire stick it changed the settings on my TV/Xbox and I wasn’t able to change it back. My TV was at 1080p and then changed the resolution to 640 x 480 as well as my Xbox - I wasn’t able to change the settings back even with a TV remote to the point I had to buy a whole new TV.

  I bought this so I could run my tv speakers through Alexa. Nearly every time I tried to stream a channel--particularly PBS--it would freeze after a few minutes or lose the sound. I'm sorry I spent the $30. My Roku works much better even if I have to listen to the tinny TV sound.

  Love my fire sticks, but it has come to the point of using my phone as the controller, because they controllers eat triple a batteries faster than any controller I have ever owned in my life, I feel like I am always replacing them and its super annoying, it shouldn't be draining power like this.

  Fairly rudimentary streaming device, no extra ginger bread, just good value. Set up easily and quickly and best of all my sign in passwords are remembered by firestick/Amazon. As far as not having TV controls, I don’t regret saving the money at all it’s no big deal.

  Roku streaming stick.  I could not get this to connect with my wireless network (which had just been upgraded along with my modem and router. There is no way to talk to a human. I sent in a ticket, received an email back and did what it said. Didn't work and they referred me back to the website. Of course I just missed the return window so I threw it out.

  I had a Roku 2 for years with no problems. I decided to upgrade to the Roku Stick, but every day at some point the sound became distorted and garbled. I tried everything, different HDMI ports, different cables, even brought the Roku stick that was working perfectly on another TV and hooked it up, everything that could be changed was changed and nothing helped. So I had to send it back. Then I then got a Roku Ultra because it has the option of a direct connection rather than WiFi. It's better, but still distorts occasionally. I am still a big Roku fan because the interface is very user friendly and in all other ways, it works perfectly.

  Since I am working from home I wanted to have a way to wirelessly mirror my laptop to my TV. It's an older one so it doesn't have any smarts built-in. Hooked this up and it works beautifully. I keep my security cameras pulled up on the TV at all times while I'm working to keep an eye on the house. Haven't used it for streaming or anything but the Rokus usually work well.

  I have 2 LG Roku TV's in my second home, so I decided to get the Roku stick for my primary residence because I really like the features of the Roku Service and my Samsung TV's at home don't have all the apps that you can get with a Roku Stick.  I've never had a problem with streaming, however, I have an Eero whole home mesh system so I don't have any WiFi dead spots in my home so my streaming has never been interrupted.  For me the best thing is all the streaming services available on Roku that are not available for Samsung TV's.  The voice command is a nice feature too, although, I always forget to use it.

  Had an old one that was regifted a few times before I broke the chain and actually opened it up to use. It was so slow and frustrating to navigate, especially through YouTube. I know part had to do with being at the edge of max range so better WiFi capabilities was my prime focus for replacement. This new Stick+ is like a Bugatti Veyron in comparison. I love it. It is so fast and getting strong connection at the furthest points of the house through all the walls and ceiling. Good job guys

  Easy setup. Good video output for online streaming to a 55"" screen. I've had better luck with some of the Roku apps (youtube, pandora) than the equivalents built into samsung TVs.The remote with this device is infuriatingly unreliable; Hitting the Pause/Play button might work, it might not work, or it might have a 1-2 second delay. I've had to kill the power and re-sync the remote once in the last month when it completely lost connection. However, the phone app for controlling it is fantastic! If you need to enter user info or do searches, use the phone app so you can type on your phone's keyboard.Occasionally, it has network connection issues, but my internet connection is somewhat unstable.I got it to access services that didn't have native apps for my tv. Some paid services really need to work on their interfaces.

  Streams fine and has all the major apps.  Super annoying bug - the remote frequently becomes disconnected with the device and needs to be 'reset' via a button in the battery cover.  Also drains batteries FAST which is surprising considering it has no displays, lights and is not doing anything 99% of time.  Support sent a weak response about headphones draining the batteries (??).  I have no idea what that means, but I would like the to address this issue which seems to be pretty common.Also annoying, they do not include the flexible HDMI extender with the stick which they really should.  You have to request it and wait for mail.

  We love these ROKU Streaming Sticks! I installed these on a Samsung 55"", Sharp 70"" and Vizio 55"" and they worked perfectly on all TV's. These are older Smart TVs that do not allow the ongoing addition of apps. They only have Netflix and Amazon and we wanted to add more. Easy to install and simple directions. Just plug into HDMI. They enhance the Wi-FI signal so that there is no lag time or buffering when in use. The search and screen functions are super fast. So easy to add new channels/services so we are now cutting the cable TV cord! Remote is also uncluttered and easy to use. I looked for quite a while until a friend recommended this particular ROKU model. Exceeded our expectations.

  I have not been able to get on Netflex or Hulu (daughters accounts) but not Roku's fault.  Also volume buttons don't work but probably something I am doing wrong.  At least I can get Prime so far.  Will give a call to those two streamers for about the 5th time each to see why I can't get back into their streaming.  I had a regular Roko stick and after several years the remote went bad so tried to upgrade.  That is probably where the problem is, probably should have stayed with what I knew.

  This is our second Roku box.  We like Roku on our main TV and expect to enjoy this too.Main complaint is that the claim that you just plug this in and start streaming is literally a large blatant lie.  There are about 100 screens you need to work your way through to set up the Roku stick.  And then a bunch of things to do on your computer too.  Setup worked for us,  but I'm not that fond of being lied to.

  It was easy to hook up and download the programming just by following the prompts. I rated it as a 'Four Star' because I've only watched one movie so far, that makes it difficult to evaluate the overall performance of the Fire Stick right now, but so far, so good!

  Not a simple 'plug and play'. It came with no instructions, nor any link for instructions. I ended up having to buy a book to figure it out. But it works well for what I needed, which was to stream PBS.org shows to my LG TV whose browser doesn't play nice with PBS.

  This thing lags and freezes every other day, I constantly have to unplug it and reset it. The voice recognition is trash, if I wanted to still have to select an app after using the voice control, I just wouldn’t use voice control. Then my internet went out and came back on, every device in my house reconnected, but with the fire sticks I had to reset them. The idea is nice, but I expected something a lot better from a company like amazon.

  This Firestick deserves 0 stars. I ordered this on Black Friday. I have to unplug it from the wall in order to get the home screen to pop up. I've called tech support 4 times. The 1st rep was clueless and seemed annoyed, the 2nd wasn't much help either. The 3rd rep had me to do an update which seemed to help one of the issues(no volumn) so I thought. I had to reset it again, then the sound came back, but I still have to unplug it in order to get the home screen when I turn the TV on so, I called again, explained the issue to the 4th rep, and asked how do I go about returning this piece of crap and order another one, and this rep hung up the phone. 🤷🏽‍♀️

  It took less than five minutes to set up which is great for me being someone with no patience at all.😀 and this is my first remote with voice control which is amazing; no more fumbling around trying to see when you’re watching in a dark room. And the best part is she understands what you’re saying unlike some voice assistants. I’m impressed already.

It’s getting annoying now, especially when you’re all planned out for a family night. The girl Crystal said even if it’s past the return window, I can still do so because she already put a note about this case. I honestly don’t want to return, and just wanted a replacement that works.It was working fine. But last night, there’s no sound whatsoever. We tried other shows, same. We went back to the tv to check, the volume work fine. Back to fireTV. Still no sounds.

  Roku again has done what it does best after a while...It stopped working. This is my 2nd and last purchase of any Roku device. I’m not sure if it’s deliberate, to force you to re-purchase or just simply not caring enough about their product or customers, but the remote has stopped working and has become non-responsive....again!There’s no customer service to speak of and the company doesn’t seem the least bit concerned about keeping their customers. They probably figure there are so many more out there, why bother addressing the same recurring issues with ""a few customers"".Of course these are my own beliefs because I’m trying to understand why a company would ignore customers who are clearly having trouble with their Roku remote freezing or dying, for no good reason....more than once?That’s another $60 wasted. Time to try the Amazon Firestick.

  Work when connected to the TV, but not when I connected it to the home theater. Roku provides no technical support through telephone, ""because the pandemic."" Seems like every other company has been able to figure out how to provide technical assistance, and it's just a veiled excuse at being cheap.I also could not email them. Clicking on the email link led to nothing.  Hopefully the Firestick will work. this doesn't.

  This was obviously a used product.  Wasn't happy about it but tried it out.Can't understand whatsoever how this gets positive reviews.  I will break it down so no one else buys this POS.1. This stick can't stream live TV.  Don't bother if this is what you want it for.I bought it hoping to stream TNF in 4k.  Impossible.  It heats up and can't perform.  I had it plugged in with the wall charger with the extension as the instructions recommended  but the fully buffered 4k lasted for about 60 seconds then went back to VHS quality.  My wifi router with 1000 mbps ATT fiber is literally 3 feet away and this is the speed this POS picks up.  Unreal.2. I thought maybe it was just my stick because it was obviously used, and perhaps it was too much for it to handle live 4K.  But then I was at a friend's house who has this same stick and he was using it to stream YouTube TV in regular HD and it continuously buffered for the entirety of a Sunday night game.  It was unwatchable, would've been better off with an antenna.  Would only get a clear picture for about 2 minutes at a time, otherwise it buffered worse than if you used an Emachine cpu from 20 years ago.3.  When this stupid piece of junk isn't streaming live TV it also will make you want to pull your hair out trying to sign in to apps.  IT. IS. SOOOOOOO. SLOOOOOOWWWW.  It even delayed on the keyboard to type in emails and passwords (with no shortcuts).  It took at least 5 minutes just to sign in to NFL app, god forbid you mistype your password!  Good luck starting over from scratch!4.  This has me reconsidering my Consumer Reports subscription.  What are they possibly giving this good reviews for? Maybe it's fine for Netflix or something but isn't that app on your smart TV anyway? I love my LG 75 inch 4k but it lacks in apps.  The picture is incredible when i use the apps built in (Netflix, Prime, etc.)  but I had to buy a supplementary device for ESPN, FOX, etc. but brother let me tell you, THIS AIN'T IT.In summary, package showed this was used by a different dissatisfied customer, it basically doesn't even work, an old school chromecast or firestick not built for 4k works 10x's than this for even the most basic streaming.Say less you say????  DO NOT BUY.

  This is my first Roku, and I really like it! It is easy to add and remove ""channels"" either on your account in the web browser on a computer or on the stick itself. I have had a Chromecast in the past and really liked it, but needed something that would be easier for guests to use. This Roku stick has been great for that! Picture quality is great and setup was fairly easy. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I haven't been able to figure out how (or even if) the remote connects to my TV to control power and volume. It doesn't bother me that much, but it would be nice to have one fewer remote to worry about. I can't comment on voice control as I haven't tried that out yet.

  Our Roku 3 notified us that we needed to upgrade it with an SD card.  Since this is an older model and the remote didn’t work the power or volume on our tv (we had to use the tv remote for that) we figured we would get the Roku Streaming Stick+ because then we would only have to use one remote and not have to deal with getting the SD card for the Roku 3.  We already have the Roku Streaming Stick + for our other tv.  They are great for us because our TVs are not smart TVs.

  I had a Roku with the tiny receiver device.  I was tired of the base always twisting because of the cord so I got this on a flash sale.  Not only does it plug into the HDMI and USB of the tv, eliminating the power cord, but the remote is much better.  With the addition of the power button and volume (mine synced to my tv with zero effort on my part) it is a dream.  The ONLY issue (minor) is that they didn't include a INPUT button so you can switch over for gaming.  While I didn't see the need for the voice control, it actually is nice because I can say ""put on the Matrix"" and if the movie is on any of my services it will tell me.  If not it will tell me who I can buy or order from and the price.  Nice little feature.

  The app I think is the best streaming app out there as of this review but the product quality of roku devices is not.  Remotes start losing strength so that u have to get closer and closer to the roku transceiver to work within one year. Two of mine of the three in the picture no longer control the devices. One of the smaller express unit also stopped working with in 2 years. And now my roku tv remote is also starting to die.  I used to have the fire stick but opted for roku for their app.  However that 5 year old device still works....slowly but it still works. Roku..if your reading this get a different manufacturer for your devices cause they are crap right now.

  I used this for an older smart TV that does not have Roku type integration. I love the existing TV and the Roku Streaming Stick+ is great! Now I don't have a reason to buy a newer TV to get the added features! One thing I didn't understand about the stick (because I didn't see it, or it wasn't explained well) is HOW it would work with my older TV and internet situation, this piece of information made it take me a while to try it. It works with WiFi and your TV's HDMI (in) port! In my case (living out of town) you want a good Internet Provider (NOT HugesNet!!!!) with plenty of speed and bandwidth - for general internet needs anyway. I guess my only complaint at all is that the stick doesn't ""turn off"". If someone has watched the Stick (HDMI) input and turned the TV off, and I turn on the TV to watch Antenna TV the Roku stick is still on, and I have to change inputs back to Antenna, that is my ONLY complaint - not a big deal. I do not have Alexa, and I have not tried ""voice"" commands.

  I was very disappointed by this for several reasons:- the stick needed to be plugged in, even on a brand new 2020 TV hdmi port- the audio and video are out of sync- the colors and contrast are all messed up, my Roku 3 that’s like 8 years old looks way better than this stickDon’t buy it. I’m packing to return right now.

  I bought a roku stick and loved it so I bought another for another television in my room. Ten months after purchase the original roku stick suddenly stopped working. My TV said no signal HDMI - 3 check if the device is connected and powered on or press the input button to select the input for the source device. I did everything including trying the stick on another TV on which a ROKU was working and hard reset but nothing worked. I came onto amazon and it said my service term of 6 months had expired. I am extremely disappointed.

  Love that we save $10.00 per box and remotes for a total of $70.00 per month on Spectrum.  It does have a learning curve, but once learned it's fine. Great price for the savings.Suggestions:I wish Prime was a button at the bottom rather than sling. The mute button is too close to the volume button and too low on the unit. It would be better if it was on the upper left side. I don't understand why Roku reboots at night for no reason. I have to find what I was watching to resume, that's a pain in the b-tt!

  I don't know if it's because I lived overseas for so long, but this voice recognition doesn't work very well for me at all. But, I have the previous version of Roku without it, so it wasn't the main reason I bought this one. I like the HD quality of the streaming, because we have a 4K HD tv and it's nice to be able to stream in HD quality. We ditched cable by getting YouTubeTV through Roku and we are seriously saving $150 a month. It's costing so much less that we splurged and got the NHL center ice package enabling us to watch all out-of-market games. Our Bruins games are on NESN which is included in the YouTubeTV package. Perfect!

  This is my first Roku, it's much more user friendly than my old Apple TV, but I've had it since Christmas and I've had to replace the batteries in the remote 4 times. The last time was 3 days after I put new ""tested"" batteries in and wasn't even using the remote. But you can watch classic Batman with Adam West on the Roku Channel so I'm not too mad.

  I bought it during the black Friday sale so the price was right. Netflix streaming via wifi is xlnt from about 40 feet away in my case, no dropouts yet, and my wifi speed is minimal. A few free channels are a bonus, but most of those have commercials. The remote is fine but not easy to use in low light -- I wish the buttons were back lit -- or easier to ID via touch. The voice search is clever but takes you to channels you may not be subscribed to, so I end up not using it. Maybe there's a way to limit it to your personal channels, which I would prefer. Overall, as a low budget streamer, Roku does a good job.

  We bought this Roku+ about a year ago. About 2-3 months ago, the remote started to eat batteries like candy (so glad we have rechargeables). Now, occasionally, the Roku seems to get ""confused"" and require a hard restart (i.e. unplugging its power and letting it sit for 30 seconds, then plugging it back in).It works, usually. The voice function works when we use it, generally.Probably should replace it because it often freezes these days - at least a couple times every month and a half. But overall, it works fine. Figure it cost me about $7/month if it only lasts a year. That's quite a bit considering I have to pay for most of the things I use on it (Hulu, Netflix, etc). But, maybe we will get lucky and be able to use it for another year. :)

  Complete piece of garbage. I had a roku from ~7 years ago and it works fine, but pretty slow. Figured I’d upgrade.Plugged in the roku to the tv and it made me connect to WiFi, of course. Entered in my password 3 times, wasn’t able to connect, asked me to restart the device.Did that, and my remote stopped working. It would accept one input then freeze for ~20 seconds or more.Restarted my tv, and was able to enter my password for WiFi. I actually connected, and then it said it needed to install updates. OK, of course.It installs updates and says it needs to restart. It restarts 5 times and then freezes on a gray screen.I restart the roku, and I’m greeted again by the welcome screen asking me to enter my password.All of this was repeated 5 times before I gave up and returned it. Do NOT buy!!!

  Estaba buscando una alternativa para el casting en mi TV, puesto que antes usaba Chromecast, pero con esto del veto a Huawei se me complico un poco la vida y por eso decidí comprar un Roku que de alguna se mantiene en terreno neutro y lo importante es que o tenga Google, Chrome o por lo menos la App de Roku instalada en el smartphone. Aunque falta expandirse mucho más con el protocolo que maneja Chromecast para que cualquier app permita la conexión, me ha servido mucho y me ha gustado incluso puedo conectar con facilidad mi PC con proyección inalámbrica sin necesidad de instalar el molesto come RAM de Chrome :). Le daría 5 estrellas si me pudiera conectar a todo, y si en mi país (Colombia) sirviera el reconocimiento de Voz y Alexa con facilidad, por el momento me reservo la estrellita mientras lo implementan.

  Remote stops working for no reason except for power on/off. Same problem with the replacement that Amazon sent. Works for a bit, then stops. Only buttons that work are power on/off and volume. Tried Roku's suggested fixes of unplugging Roku, removing batteries, remote resync. Works for about a day or two at best, then stops again.RUBBISH!! Roku for god's sake fix the problem with your infra red remote, and stop fooling folks!! Returning second replacement.

  I had been using my XBOX or Playstation to stream stuff since we did not have smart TVs in the past. I had no idea this was so simple! I would have done this so much sooner. It's SIMPLE! I got the most basic one, so I can't rate voice command or Alexa etc. However, with the most basic one, the install, set up and use is and was, SO SIMPLE! It's compatible with EVERYTHING I use including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Peacock, Youtube, Crackle, Disney plus, and just about anything else I could think of. Roku itself had tons of free stuff to stream and we use it all the time! It's easy enough for the youngest child in the house to use, and the oldest adult who is a little electronic challenged at times to figure out as well. We're all happy with it. We got a second one for another room in the house less than a week later. Paid under 30 bucks a piece to stream everything I thought had to be done a smart tv or video game machine...wish I had gotten this sooner, I could have ditched the XBOX in the family room years ago LOL. Now I don't have to hear video games anymore cause they are ONLY in the kids rooms. :)

  This is the first fire stick lite that I’ve bought. I’ve had three regular fire sticks and decided to try this one because it was half the price. It seems pretty comparable, but the quality of the lite is a little bit inferior. So when I have to buy another one I’ll buy the original.

  Works great! Just make sure your tv even if recently purchased has ability for voice recognition w Alexa. 2 out of 3 of our tv's it works with..all are smart tvs though...its not a firestick issue it's a tv that doesn't have the Alexa capability. We haven't had any issues w the firestick at all.

  We were unable to get our Disney+ on our COX cable TV. We were able to use the fire stick to access our premium services with our smart TV. We don’t have Alexa and haven’t tried voice activation. Fire does require much higher volume number to hear appropriately.

  This product advertised that it supported Netflix.  There was even a picture of Netflix on the box.  I had to call support and I was dealing it as it sent me to the Philippines.  My experience with the customer service rounded to the Philippines has been awful.  While the people answering the phone are kind and patient, they are rarely trained well.  This was with other companies .  My Amazon experience was great!  The young man I got listened and fixed my problem correctly in a short amount of time.  He actually had to take over my screen and download Netflix  I believe his name was Arnes.

  The device works well when it works. Almost daily it locks up and needs to be restarted. Software interaction and remote use is fine. Even the voice recognition works well when the device IS NOT LOCKED UP.

  I had been using a Fire TV box for the last couple of years. When I first started using it there were few problems and it worked as advertised. I occasionally had to reboot it but not too often. Over time I had to reboot it more and more often until eventually I had to reboot it ever time I wanted to use it. I also had to take out and re-insert the batteries to the remote in order for it to connect to the box. After getting fed up I purchased this Roku and wow is it great. I've not had one issue with it since Day 1. The remote is always connected and much more responsive than the Fire TV remote ever was. The interface is easier to use and moving between menu items is much quicker. The streaming is excellent. I can't recommend this device highly enough. Superb piece of hardware at a great price.

  We've been a Roku user for years, but have been plagued recently by streaming services continuously buffering for months. Having only Satellite internet we had turned the resolution down to 480p in order to watch anything. After reading other reviews and betting on the long range wireless extender fixing our issues we were not let down.  The new Roku player streams at 1080 resolution and I can't remember the last time we had to wait on a show to buffer.  This new device has really made a dramatic difference!  The device is also fast to respond to the remote and when booting up only takes a 1/3 of the time the old device did.  Overall very happy we upgraded and if you have limited internet options I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

  My first Roku early last year was the ""express"" stick. It was far better than my FIOS service in choices picture quality, options and value. To be honest I was amazed and wished I had made the move to a Roku sooner! I would have enjoyed netter TV, and saved a LOT of money. Still it occasionally had some buffering on the wireless as my TV is a fair distance from my router. After I did several hours of research I decided the best value would be the RoKu Stick Plus. Wow! I hoped it would be a lot better, but I didn't expect a quantum leap in every category! Oh MY GOD! It's incredible! Even more free TV! More choices! More movies! More quality! MUCH faster! No buffering even when all my kids are gaming online! Just WOW! I cannot recommend this device highly enough!

  I already have LG smart TV with its default OS. Even though it has fancy stuff like cursor, the connection was a nightmare. I always need to connect to Wifi manually and netflix gets disconnected multiple times making TV watching a bad experience. Since it is a big screen, I thought I'd go for the top stick option.Installation was a breeze. Remote is simple and easy to use. Interface is just perfect. Smooth, fast and simple UI experience. No issues with any apps I've used so far. Not sure about the advantages of this item vs other sticks from Roku. But Roku stick, any type/model, is definitely something you should invest in if your TV OS isn't good or slow.

  Roku is definitely the way to go if you're interested in cutting the cable tv scene. Have been using a new Streaming Stick + for a couple of weeks. Setup was reasonable, adding channels as well. However periodically, sometimes more than once a day, the remote stops functioning. This can range from zero function to volume up/down is the only thing working. Having to power off the Roku, remove batteries, wait briefly, and start back up. Have not gone through a re-paring the power off/battery out has been working.Still believe this is the device I want. Will be trying a re-paring setup again.This would all be 5 stars if the remote wasn't flaky.

  The Roku Stick+ has enabled my Viszo m70-3c Tv to be worth a darn.  I bought that TV 2.5 years ago and if never worked well - crappy app interface, no Disney+ app (even a year after launch), PLEX didn't work, and the Sonos speakers sounded muted.  However, once I plugged the Roku Stick+ in all that changed and I am left with a wonderful User Interface, great sound management and the Disney+ App.  this piece of equipment saving our TV and it is now a place we can watch our streamed content (we don't have cable TV).

  I decided to cut the cord.  I bought this along with the Apple TV 4K.  I have returned to Apple TV.  This little thing is a beast.  It streams virtually every service available and does it without issue.  The interface is simple.  The remote on the Roku+ is awesome in that it also controls your TV and volume.  So, you now have this one little remote to literally everything if you have cut the cord exclusively.  Also, through the app on the phone you can stream pictures, videos, music from your phone (which is frankly the main reason I bought the AppleTV for ease of streaming from my iDevices).  I would buy this again without hesitation, and I have done so for the TVs in my other room.

  Bought this for vacations after I lost our older version (sorry hunny!).(SKIP down if you already own a Roku).  All Roku devices have essentially the same setup, menu, and features.  It’s very easy to get started, find apps, and navigate.  It has minimal advertisements and less “in your face” suggestions as compared to an Apple TV.  We are an Apple family and have switched to AppleTV twice...then promptly went back to Roku.  Unfortunately Roku’s search is still a mess and more-or-less useless.The only issue we have with Our Roku’s (we use 3 different versions of them scattered through the house) is sound quality.  If you stream through a high end home theater system, be aware that Roku and PLEX do not support much more than basic 5.1 channel surround.  This is a problem for audiophiles but no biggie for others.(ABOUT this Roku vs others)-  we bought it for traveling.  It plugs into hotel TVs easily.  Make sure to call the hotel’s tech support and they will register the Roku’s MAC address (found on the back of the Roku stick) so it will connect to WiFi.Finally the remote can control your TV. This has been a common complaint for some time now and I’m so happy it’s finally an included feature.  This makes it easy for the kids to navigate the hotel TV and we don’t have to use the nasty public remote.The only con, and it should be expected, is speed.  The Roku sticks are ALWAYS slower than the Roku boxes in our experience.  If you’re going from Roku Ultra or even a Roku 3 to this you will notice everything takes about twice as long to load.  Menus are still responsive and navigation is fine but actual loading times is noticeably slower.Still the best “cord cutting” device out there vs FireTV/AppleTV/etc.  This is also a worthy upgrade over the older streaming stick with the improved video quality and universal remote.Update:  We took it to Disney and did not have to register the MAC address.  We just plugged it in, selected the WDW guest WiFi, and away we went.  Bonus that WDW uses Samsung tv in their rooms and we have one at home so I didn’t even have to program the remote.

  I have an older model Roku which works fine, but when I moved it to a TV in an upstairs bedroom, it could not connect to my wi-fi.  I thought about upgrading the wi-fi, but in the meantime, searched the newer Roku models and found this one which promised better wi-fi connectivity.  And it delivered!  It works perfectly in the far upstairs corner of the house and I am thrilled to be able to expand TV choices in that room.  Great buy and works great.

  have been using Roku products for about 6 years and have been very pleased so far. I have an A/V receiver in another room that controls my tv and surround sound so I plugged the stick directly into the receiver. Everything works great, until you let it sit for a few hours and it goes into some kind of power saving mode. The remote will no longer connect to the stick without walking into the other room and pressing a button so it will reconnect. I tried every setting I could find and had no luck. The range on the remote is amazing once it is connected, but it was very annoying to lose signal constantly. I am returning this product and have a Roku Ultra hooked up to my receiver right now...which is working just fine. I am a big fan of the hard-wired connection available for the Ultra and the ability for the device to accept a usb stick to stream media. The other really nice thing is that I can control my tv power and the volume of my receiver (which, remember is in another room) all with the Roku remote. I know that I have a unique situation, but Roku still had a device that works for me. I do wish that they would note the range of the remote to the stick when pairing. Overall it is a great product, just not for my setup.

  The fire tv lite overall looks great if you using a 1080P TV if you have a higher resolution than that you should go for the 4k version.

  This is my 3rd firestick. I love them, and have them on every tv in the house! I love the new interface on the home screen, it's a different set up than on my older previous versions. The only difference in the lite version and the more expensive one is that the more expensive one (in addition to 4k)has volume control, and I couldn't justify paying extra for that when I have a tv remote. The lite version is perfect for me, because I don't yet have a 4k TV and don't plan on buying one anytime soon.

  Purchased a Roku Streaming Stick+ to avoid utilizing my Sony smart TV to stream PlayStation Vue, Netflix, Google Play, Amazon video and youtube. Much simpler to use for streaming than the TV with a a simple interface and easy access to apps (you choose what is shown on the homepage). Also like that the Roku smartphone app allows you to listen to the audio via headphones. Roku's  PlayStation Vue app is far superior to the app that came on my Sony TV eliminating many of the issues I experience with PlayStation Vue. Picture quality is excellent.  I highly recommend the product and wish I had purchased sooner.

  I have seen so many great reviews for the Roku Streaming Stick + I felt had to order one for myself.Just opened up the package and started reading the instructions and noticed the instructions say batteries are included.  I am assuming they would normally be in the space in the bottom right corner of the packaging (image attached.)Not sure how they are missing.  Possibly a returned unit and the person that originally order it kept the batteries?I'm noting 2 stars because of the missing batteries. While I could (and ultimately have to) buy ones to use, being they were supposed to be included this is an additional cost that I will incur before I can set up the unit.

  I have 2 roku tv’s by TCL, so when I upgraded my 32” tv to a 55” I decided to LG OLED. The LG app line-up can’t beat Roku app library. So I decided to buy a roku streaming stick, because my kids and mrs are all use to the roku interface. The Lg doesn’t even have the disney channel, pbs, and locast.I don’t even think samsung interface can beat the roku app library.I did try to use alexa with the roku stick and it does not work. Good thing I didn’t buy the roku to work with alexa, otherwise this will be a lower star review. The roku voice remote does the voice commands well, so I don’t think I’ll be using alexa to control my tv anytime soon.

Did everything I wanted, including a higher resolution picture, which is as good as any of the other video input devices I have for my 4K monitor. I also got some extras that I did not expect in the lowest price model. The best new feature is ability to use the Iphone speakers or Iphone headphones/earbuds. So I can watch Hamilton on Disney+ cranking the music on my high-quality headphones without disturbing my sleeping roommates.

  I got a recently cable bill with a sizable increase so I thought I could cut the cord and look into streaming devices.  I recommend that you do your homework to find the device that works best for you.  For me the Roku was the one.  It is very easy to use and I like that they make free viewing a part of the home screen.  I also subscribed to a streaming channel that has almost all my favorite cable channels for less than half the price of my ever increasing cable bill

  This particular roku model is only 2.4 ghz. Other models can handle 5 ghz. This is important bcz I use free wifi supplied by my apt complex. 10 buildings, 13 apts per building. This means hundreds of users. All using 2.4 ghz networks. Soo frustrating, with so many users you just keep getting bumped off, "" buffering"" they say. You can't even get 5 min into a movie or video. BEWARE! BUY ROKU STICK MODEL=5 ghz capibility and no problems!! Good luck

  As the home entertainment industry continued to change, I have been in search of the best vehicle to stream through the most, access enough of local programming, and essentially pick/choose the channels I watch all the time. For years, I watched Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV, etc. I always returned to Roku. With its multiple levels of models for the bedroom to the multimedia room at its great price points. I don't think anyone could choose better unless there is a specific feature not provided. I bought the first and after playing with that, bought two more each of a different level. Direct TV will be leaving my home shortly.

  So, I had a Roku which looked like an over sized, thick coaster and it was requiring it to be re-booted about every other day.  It would simply lock up.  So, I purchased this Roku stick figuring I just had one which was not functioning well.  Well, the Roku stick fails to play UHD from VUDU and defaults to the HDX version.  When I use the VUDU function on my TV I never have a problem with the UHD playback.Also, the remote this comes with requires re-connecting, also about, every two days.  It will not keep a constant connection.  You have to reboot the stick and then reestablish the remote connection every other day.  I kept with Roku as the other devices do not seem to include VUDU which is where my movie library is located.  I gave it a one star as when it works, it is fine, it just has tantrums every other day as well as no UHD.  And, yes, I have attempted all of the 'fixes' listed by Roku regarding the remote problem and I do have the two mhz bands on my router.  No joy.

  After having T-Mobile's TVision for a little over a year (after cutting Comcast which I had for over 10 years), I carefully researched the newest and latest competitive TV streaming devices and decided to get the Roku 4k+ Streaming Stick.  Very easy install process (pretty much plug n play), good interface and unlike T-Mobile's streaming with constant buffering, looping and outages; haven't had any issues thus far.  Excellent picture quality and a boat-load of streaming options (albeit some repetitive).  All in all, pretty satisfied and the best part is, you can't beat free programming!  Certainly you have options for additional paid subscriptions and premium services but hey, the objective was all about saving some money and eliminating escalating cable TV prices.

  This Roku works great I’m happy with it. I had a chromecast that sucked constantly disconnected. I had a free basic roku that was ok also disconnected. But I heard the other reviews decided to try it again paid a little more and got the streaming stick plus that has better long range wifi signal strength and I am definitely happy. It doesn’t disconnect anymore. All my apps and channels come in strong and in HD. Very happy very worth your money definitely get this one!!

  After turning in my cable box for an extra tv to Spectrum to cut monthly equipment rental costs, I was left without my customary cable channels on my family room television.  I ordered this to have the capability of downloading the SpectrumTV app, as well as the convenience of other apps like  Netflix and  AmazonTV.  The device was super easy to setup -- i just plugged it in and powered it on, then followed the on-screen instructions.  I have a RokuTV in our kitchen, and another Roku stick in a spare bedroom. Love the way their product works!  I wish i had ordered this sooner fur the family room.  So convenient!

  Arrived earlier than promised. Nicely packaged. Plugged into my HDMI in back of TV, put batteries in remote..and ROKU TOOK OVER! Easy as pie... All apps from my previous Roku3 were installed and on screen prompts enabled other functions including volume control and TV on and off features. The Roku also provided a  separate 4K app which allowed me instant access to lots of 4K HDR movies free and also those with nominal fee. In addition there are many 4K HDR  travel documentary apps Venice, USA, etc and the picture clarity and depth is AWESOME, a huge difference from my Roku3. A great buy at a great price! Thanks.

  I bought this for my guest bedroom (which is very far from my wireless router and through many walls, so I was nervous about this alleged ""Long Range Wireless"" claim) - but I was delighted that it works flawlessly with no stuttering or blocky artifacts. My mother is visiting form overseas so she can keep herself well-entertained with great Netflix/Hulu/etc movies and shows while I'm at work.The only downside is that the included power-cable option for the stick is *really* short at about 1-foot long.

  ROKU must be a foreign company with no one to support the product. I can't log on, they say they will email a link to update my password but they don't. Call their support line 816-272-0000 and listen to the automated message.  What a joke! I signed up for a monthly subscription thru YouTube TV and can not cancel it. I am writing the FCC and asking for them to research the company for FRAUD....

  Remote constantly disconnects. I have had three of these streaming stick+ and they all had the same issue. The first one I had for a year with no issues and then it started being extremely slow on start up with the remote unpairing. I bought a new one and the issue was even worse so I swapped it out for a new thinking maybe it was just defective. Nope, the unpairing is even worse. I have a regular streaming stick for over a year and that's never happened. I changed HDMI inputs, TV's, Remotes, HDMI extender, power sources, called customer support, everything and nothing helped. Everything else worked fine and picture was great but it's useless if I have to repair the remote each time I use it.

  This was to replace a set top box in a guest room.  It occasionally loses the sound, but that is remedied by turning off and on again or disconnecting it and plugging back in.  For the price I paid vs money saved for set top box rental, I'm happy with it.

  I can’t remember what I paid for this when I bought it three yrs ago. But it could swear it was three times what I paid here on Amazon. I just wanted. To say, if you don’t have a smart TV or whatever they’re called, this is a must. Even if you buy one next month, what’s the harm. I got this for my parents. They watched everything downstairs on their smart TV. Now they can watch separately and my mom can enjoy her absolute favourite hobby while watching The Crown- folding laundry on the great wide space of their bed.

  When it works, it’s great. when it doesn’t, I have to reset it. I ran diagnosis on my tv, the WiFi was working fine, my other tv played the applications no problem with a ps4 connection.

  I have had several fire sticks and one fire box. I really enjoy all of the content and the fact that the search looks in all apps and gives you options to watch. There is so much free content I like that I couldn't even watch it all. I would have given it a 5 star except this newest stick I have to scroll down 7 levels to get to the show I was just watching or search again. I like to see the most recent and select from them until I'm done watching them. Amazon please fix this!

  I am learning to use wifi streaming and a Roku was recommended. Setting it up was actually very easy and I did have to request help with a code and the Customer Service was patient and very helpful, excellent service. She also madevitbperfectly clear that the service is totally free and Roku will never ask for any fees or charges.I am frustrated with the Voice recognition, it continually says it does not understand what I said. I speak perfect English, and speak slowly and distinctly, then when it finally and rarely understands, ( like one word commands) ie:” news, ” it sends me off in the wrong direction. I just use the letter search instead.

  I bought this November 2019. I've replaced the remote batteries last night for the third time. I've had to unplug and reset the device at least 10 times over this period. At least 2 or 3 times a week it just shuts off without explanation. On top of it's technical failures, the platform is not nearly as easy to use as Fire Stick from Amazon, and really could use an update. The worst part of the device is how incredibly slow it is. I also bought a ROKU TV, which I find is much faster. On average it takes at least 4 minutes to get this running sometimes longer, sometimes it just freezes.

  I've purchased 3 of these devices and all are working well. Setup is a little wonky (had a couple of hiccups with having the mobile app on my phone installed - setup does not really recognize the mobile app and forces you to long into website via browser). Also wish there is an easier way to coordinate the panels on the home screen between all the controllers - should be able to sync all the home screens to one setup. So far works well and I'm able to get rid of my cable tv subscription and just use all my streaming services.

  At first i bought ROKU Stick+ to make my tv smart. Roku is really nice product.. But it doesn't have support to web browser, what means that you can't enter directly to the websites. What is good if you live in a country where you have free movie streaming websites. Even browser screen mirroring apps are worst on Roku.  So i made some research and found out that Fire TV Stick have several web browsing apps. And now i'm using Fire tv Stick, it's little bit sluggish then Roku but do the job perfectly. Otherwise both are good product and do the same thing.

  We don't use the TV we have this connected to that frequently, but in the 1.5 months we have had it the remote stopped working. We put new batteries and then it worked. Disappointed that the remote seems to be draining batteries in less than a month's time with little use.

  I haven’t hooked it up yet; but I bought this because it had Disney + on the remote.  It is not the remote pictured.  For $60.00 you would expect to get what is advertised.  I hope it has Disney + on it or I’ll be returning my first ever Amazon product.UPDATE!! I hooked it up and kicking myself fir not buying this sooner!!! Having all apps in one area is so nice!!! It does have Disney + but not on the remote as pictured.  Still, best thing!!  You can also use the app on your phone as a remote for your tv!  Great fir people with 10 remotes and can’t find the one you need!

  I'm a long time Roku user and love the products so I decided to give the stick a try. This ""stick"" is larger than you might think. Because of where the HDMI port is on my TV it would not fit. Roku knows this because they will send you a free adaptor but it takes 3-5 days. Why not simply include it in the box? I guess to provide a substandard customer service experience. Also not clear is the ""stick"" gets its power from an external adaptor that is included.Once the part came and I got it installed it worked very well. Even getting a more reliable internet connection from my WiFi.Save your self some time and just get the standard box unit. It comes with everything you need to get up and running.

  The headline pretty much covers it. This is the 2nd Roku+ Stick 4k that has failed for me! Roku tech support is slow to respond and gives a lot of solutions none of which include sending a new stick or remote which I believe is the underlying problem since nothing else they've told me to do has worked. Save yourself the trouble and only buy the Roku set-top devices, not the sticks and you'll have a much better experience.

  I use Roku for everything.  It's really helpful since I have a subscription to Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu.  We don't pay for cable, just the 3 services I mentioned above, and Roku comes with a ton of other options for watching regular TV shows and the news.  Haystack TV is my favorite free app that comes preinstalled on Roku, as it lets you customize which local or world news programs you see, and then it plays them all in rotation one 3-5 minute clip at a time. I love it. Every morning with my coffee I'm able to watch local news, world news, and the weather within about 12 minutes (and only on channels I prefer).

  Roku requires the user to create an account to use streaming services on their device.  This isn't an issue in itself...but they also require a payment method (credit card or PayPal) and address despite the fact that I have no desire to purchase any services or apps from Roku directly.  Additionally, they serve ads to the user.  Now, I realize this isn't an issue for many, but these reasons are sufficient for me to return the device.  I will not surrender my CC info, phone number, and address to yet another business - especially one who I am not intending to purchase services from.  And I will NOT be served ads on a device by the company I've paid to provide the device.  I don't want your ecosystem, your proprietary services, or your ads - and I especially don't want your data scraping BS, selling my viewing habits and demographics to ad agencies to further your bottom line.  Give me just the hardware that can play my chosen streaming services!  That's what I'm paying for.  For these reasons, I'll hard pass on anything Roku in the future.

  I don’t use the voice function or Alexa integration but I stream movies, music, and shows with no problems.

  I purchased this item to replace an old Roku Stick that had audio distortion. Now I find that this one has distorted audio as well, perhaps even worse than the one it replaced. It's not the TV. There's no distortion when I listen to other sources using the same HDMI port on the TV. I've tried all the HDMI ports on the TV, and I've tried the stick on other TVs. The distortion follows the Roku stick. And I followed the only Roku-recommended solution of powering off the stick and the TV and restarting them, but the distortion persists.Additionally, the stick frequently fails to respond to the remote. It does eventually respond, but it sometimes takes up to 30 seconds to do so. It doesn't appear to be a problem with the remote, because the TV controls on the Roku remote (power, volume and mute) still work even when Roku is frozen (sometimes it freezes while on the Roku menu so that I'm unable to navigate, and other times it fails to respond when watching a channel (e.g., doesn't respond to the back button or the home button).All in all, I'm thoroughly disappointed with the product and will be returning it.

  I had on old original ROKU that I suspected might be making my HULU freeze up and reboot constantly.  Turns out I was right.  I ordered this for $10 less than my local W-mart (wouldn't price match).  Plugged it in and HULU works pretty well now with very few hiccups.  I recently cut my cable provider and decided to try streaming.  HULU worked best for me with sports and locals.  Voice recognition is excellent.  Power and volume buttons for tv work great.  Wish it had a mute button and a channel back button though.  Also no longer has an Amazon shortcut key but has Netflix, ESPN, HULU, and Sling.  ROKU let's you access quite a bit of content too.

  I am on my second Roku Streaming Stick+.  I returned the first one to Amazon thinking it was defective for eating batteries.  The second one does the exact same thing.  I went onto the ROKU BLOG and found many other users were having the same issue.  I contacted ROKU customer support and am waiting for them to send me a new remote that is supposed to solve the problem.  In the meantime their solution is to use the Smartphone app as a remote or try plugging the ROKU into a wall outlet (both are pretty sub-optimal suggestions).  Apparently the USB power option through your TV could be the root cause of their product defect.  I am a big fan of ROKU products and have had various ROKU's since their inception.  I do not have this issue with my ROKU express which is the product I would recommend buying until ROKU solves this product defect.  I will update this review when ROKU fixes the Streaming Stick+ remote defect.

  I was very excited to use this product as I have a Roku device that has never failed me in over 5 yrs.  I recently brought a 4K TV and thought to upgrade the Roku system.  Everyone loved the ease, look and remote control...Fast forward 3 weeks:  The device started taking a long time to load, then started jumping to the starting screen, a few days later would continue to display ""no signal"".  Now every time we turn on the tV it prompts to pair the remote to the device and does not advance to actually pair.  I ended up disconnecting the stick from the TV and reconnecting the 5 yr old Roku and happily watching TV once again.  What a big disappointment with this Roku stick!  $50 wasted!

  This is probably my fifth or sixth Roku stick and I am officially done with them.  I let my wife and I get used to them just dying after 5-6 months so we bought extras for when the next one died.  Then they started overheating on a regular basis which meant unplugging them and turning off the TV until they cooled down.  Then I got errors requiring me to unplug the Roku stick and my TV for everything to reset.  I'm done.  The Amazon Firestick is a superior product.  Bye Bye Roku

  I got the Roku stick just for the xfinity ap so we do not have to pay for a cable box.  The claim of this product if to have a great remote and better range for WiFi, not so. Our Firestick on this TV has NEVER had an issue to the WiFi range but this Roku stick has terrible range and flat will not work. We even installed a mesh system and still have problems.  We have followed all the steps on the troubleshooting, and even got the hdmi extension  and it still does not consistently work.  We are pretty much at the stage of sending this back.  Firestick works MUCH better and we get access to pretty much everything  Roku has with the exception of the xfinity app.  I wish the Firestick had that ap.

  I bought this to replace a Chromecast.Pressing the play/pause button on the remote while in screensaver mode (which, you will go into when paused so this happened to me a lot) ""installs"" channels that you don't want and didn't ask for.  It will also exit the app you are watching to do this. Infuriating.Ads plastered on 30% of the main screen.The Chromecast was simple, too simple.  In many ways it did more, and at least it was selling my data in the background instead of in my face :)Update: I have ditched this and got a ""Chromecast with Google TV""  far superior, but you wont find it on Amazon because of of a Amazon/Google spat.

  If you don't mind using a second remote, the one that came with your TV, this is a great price for the LITE version. You probably have to use a second (or third) remote for your cable/satellite anyway so why not save a few bucks? The programming is excellent.

  I got a firestick because cable is just to expensive so I decided to try it out and good for what it does but their are two thing I don't like about it number 1 the app selection is very limited compared to other streaming devices and number 2 is the remote I think it the biggest problem with the fire stick line it so cheap sometimes I will press the buttons and nothing will happen if they can make a better remote that will works 100% of the time I'm down. Apologies for the way I wrote this

  I’m so in love with this Fire Stick Lite! I’m using it in my master bedroom and all the updates are wonderful. It was easy to connect everything. A lot of apps didn’t need me to sign in at all. The graphics are clear and very easy to understand. I’m so glad I upgraded.

  I’ve been a faithful fire stick owner for like, a decade? And this one is crap. Not sure if it’s because it’s a “lite” or what. It runs sooooo slow & can’t seem to handle just Netflix and Hulu. I’d return it, but decided to just put in on a guest room tv that never gets used. Meh. I miss the fire tv :(

  I bought the Lite version for my daughter so she could watch YouTube and I immediately noticed how much slower it is than all my other fire sticks are.  This will be the last one I buy.  I would recommend spending the extra money on the full version.

  I got tired of waiting for Xfinity to add a streaming app to allow me to watch HBO Max on my TV, so I decided to purchase a device that would give me access to it. After reviewing the pros and cons of all devices that provided access to HBO Max, I decided to go for the Fire TV Stick Lite.In addition to HBO Max, it offers access to many streaming services. Best of all, It was very easy to set up.

  Works great! One thing I didn’t know though: you apparently have to unplug then replug the fire stick to turn it on and off. It’s fine but I wasn’t aware when purchasing. I will admit I regret not buying the fire stick with volume control but it works perfectly fine and does what it’s supposed to.

  I ordered this after several friends told me how great it was. It was perfect until it just all of a sudden stopped working. I tried the troubleshooting, everything recommended even after resetting back to the factory resets. But I really REALLY liked this product before it went out on me.

  Works great with my super slow rural internet. I've always had Roku devices and I really like this firestick, which I bought to replace a many years old Roku stick. When it's time, I'll replace them all with firesticks. The internet browser alone is a game changer.

  the price was right so i was willing to try and since then i purchased a few more for other tvs . now i can watch where ever i go. the only bad thing is that not all tvs can have it directly into the hdmi port but the extra extension makes it work.

  I didn't know the difference between the 2 Firesticks meaning Regular/Lite. It's not noted when your looking to purchasing a Firestick. If it is I didn't see it. The controller doesn't illuminate, so at night it's hard to use the functions.  No closed captions option. My original TV controller no longer works, so it would have been nice to have these features. I should have done a lot more research before purchasing. I would have went with the regular Firestick. Also extremely disappointed that I signed up for Live TV then get an email 2 days later rates that are going up $20.00. Now I'm really saying WTF, this was a bad idea.

  Fire TV Stick Lite is perfect. My TV remote actually works with it, so I didn't need the higher-priced Fire Stick. The Lite version is super-fast, very easy to install and makes it so easy to watch any program and app you want. Great, great product.

  The remote is not design to control your TV or volume. AS some customers has stated some apps will display with a black box so you'll have to read which app it is to distinguish it from another. Overall it does everything that my other firestick(s) does so it's good for the low price. I have it installed in a spare bedroom.

  Don’t use the voice recognition or volume control however this stick was so easy to set up it made me suspicious.It works much smoother than the old stick and acquires and keeps a signal whereas the old one wasn’t doing that any more.

  Had Fire Stick for TV in family room. Added this to be able to use in Master Bedroom. Works well. Voice Recognition is work in progress obviously. We don't use Alexa for much so it is wasted on us. No Alexa in MBR; no need for spy in our bedroom.

  Easy to use and very reasonably priced. I got mine for $25 bucks and I love it!!  I had Roku before the amazon stick and I hated it. The Roku is much slower and doesn’t have voice control, the amazon stick was fast and program was easy to learn. Recommend over anything else for sure! Can’t go wrong with fire stick.

  I have bought two of these and they both have the same problem where they stop recognizing the wireless receiver making the stick useless.  The full size versions to not have this problem,  if you go on ROKU forums you will see tons of people with the exact same issue.  Save your money and avoid this version at all costs!

  Would recommend this Roku streaming stick+. Had issues with one of the two I purchased failing, but it was replaced, quickly. Cut my cable TV off months ago and these sticks have saved me tons of money. I'm a prime member, so have the benefit of prime video, which is perfect. They work on two, 10 year old TV's. One 58"" Plasma and and another 32"", basic flat screen. Have had them for about a year now and still working fine.I don't use the voice recognition or Alexa, so cannot comment on that.I gave the sticks a 5 star review but left the voice recognition and Alexa blank, so I hope that does not lower my 5 star rating.

  I couldn't be more pleased with this Roku stick. I have a Samsung so-called SMART TV that is, frankly, an idiot.  The television is clunky, streams horribly, and super slow with the apps.  I got this Roku primarily for the Disney+ /Mandalorian/ series (which is awesome), but it's so much more than I bargained for.  First, it streams in 4K, and I didn't know my television was 4K!  Second, once it loads, the interface is /fast/, and my downloaded apps work /fast/.  Basically this inexpensive stick streamer saved me from throwing my Samsung television out the window.

  Have had this for just under 6 months and now it has to be reset every day to be able to use it. Very frustrating to have to keep doing the setup on it anytime I want to use it. Last night we had to reset it multiple times before it would work. Not sure how much longer will be able to use it. Of course it only as a 30 day return policy so I'm out of luck getting a replacement. Says it was updated for 2019 but this must be older model hardware and only the software was updated. UPDATE: saw some other reviews that said something about the batteries. So I tried replacing the batteries before hitting the reset button once again. This worked, but I should not have to replace the batteries every day. So far 2 days in a row I've had to replace the batteries. UGH!

  It's fast, and it's 4k... but that's all that's good about it. I have been having problems like so many other people have had with any 4k Roku. I will be watching something and it will go black with no sound for a few seconds then come back on. Poor streaming quality with a lot of the apps, like blurry for a couple minutes when I start a show. I have tried all troubleshooting there is for this device, I have read all the articles about these problems... nothing can be done. I wasted money on it. I have a 4k TV and I'll need to buy a 1080p Roku for it. What a waste.

  This product is a terribly designed piece of equipment. They rely upon your wifi for the remote to work and it's a known issue that they cause problems between wifi routers and these remotes. Either your wifi will work or the remote will work. They both don't work at the same time EVER. Do a search for Roku Remote Keeps Falling Asleep, and Roku Breaks Wifi for a rundown on the issue. Roku customer support has been TERRIBLE on this issue, and despite this being a known issue, all they do is offer to send a new product out, which has the same exact issue. It's an amazing fail.

  I purchased an Amazon fire stick first before this was so disappointed with the buffering. But this Roku stick is awesome!! We have used it in lieu of a cable box to stream live TV and it has worked flawlessly. It even worked in the furthest corner of our house in the garage! Very easy to set up and use. Only glitch has been the remote, a couple of times it seemed to freeze but after taking batteries out and putting them back in it works fine.

  If you purchase this item you will have to pay 99.95 to get it hooked up at the last minute. I paid 69.95 because I told them I would not pay 99.95. I did not know there was a hookup charge, they don't tell you that until you have it all hooked up. Then you have to call them to complete the installation and that's when they want to charge you.I would not recommend this product because of this. I don't like surprises like that. If you are honest you would tell people up front there is a hookup charge.

  I bought a couple of these.  The product works pretty good when it's working.  The wireless is unstable and doesn't connect sometimes even though I have a nearby brand new WiFi6 router.  The remotes are flaky and stop working for no apparent reason.  Sometimes you have to re-pair them to get them to work again.  They also eat batteries at an astonishing rate.  The wireless situation seems better after using the provided power adapter, since it's on all the time, and you don't have to wait what seems like an eternity for the wireless to connect.

  Stopped Working after 90 days. We keep getting a ""Low Power"" Window that opens comes up every time we try to open up Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote with TV Controls (updated model for 2019).  The original /standard Roku we purchased for our family room is still working well in our Family Room after several years.  I can't recommend version I'm reviewing with ""Voice Remote"" because it stopped working. Buy the less expensive version without the ""voice remote"".

  I wish I had known to purchase this sooner. I almost bought a new tv just to obtain the smart feature. Installation was very easy and I was thrilled to find access to Netflix, Prime and Hulu plus much more. My cable service is very iffy when switching to Netflix and often freezes. Now it is so quick and smooth. Going to be a cable cutter very soon as this is the solution for me. The reception seems clearer than my cable service with no pixellation or problems receiving a channel - Only negative is the remote is small and seems cheap, doesn't light up like my cable provided remote - It does have volume control on it.

  Cut the cord from satellite. Streaming via dsl for 1/4 the price of dish and directv. Super easy setup and install. Tried the voice recognition and it was more trouble than just clicking about I found. It did not like me yelling “ No that’s NOT what I said” at it repeatedly. And sometimes in the middle of a show the roku will suddenly go into reboot mode and make this crazy bloop bloop bloop sounds. Then I can restart my programs and watch all those great commercials agin on youtubetv that I used to able to skip until they raised their price by $10 a month. Still saving $100 a month over satellite though so I guess I can watch those endless Car commercials and erectile dysfunction ads.

  I've loved Roku and want to put it on more TVs here at my house and replace the F i r e sticks I have here.  But the remote that came with mine has to be reset 3-4 times/day.  I loaded the Roku app on my phone which works well as a remote so not a huge loss, but the worry about the remote functionality prevents me from purchasing more just to swap out my fire sticks .

  After a ton of research on ways to decrease our cable bill WITHOUT losing the services we love I found Roku which is one of the only streaming devices that can stream Xfinity. So I bought on Black Friday for $29 each and plugged them into all the TVs in the house and got rid of the physical cable boxes with exception to one - the main “set top DVR” box which you have to keep but runs $10 for rental... ok better than the $60 I was paying each month for all 6 boxes with a one time investment of $145 for all the Rokus which literally pays for themselves after 2.5 cable bills!

  We have cut the cable and in my TV room which is in the back of the house the reception was horrible.  Lots of spooling time, pixels, sometime so bad I would turn off the TV.  All of that stopped when I plugged in the Roku wireless stick.  I now enjoy shows uninterrupted by any of that. Also, I am not the most techy person and usually have my daughter set things up for me the  first time, but I was able to set it up myself.  I am very happy, so much so that I bought two more for Christmas gifts.  Try it, you won't be sorry.  And if you are, hey it's Amazon they will take it back.

  This is my 2nd roku device. Bought this one for basement tv, however the activation code would not work and it prompted me to call help number.

Never buy another of there products!!

  I bought this device because one of my smart TVs constantly loses connection while streaming and the hope was that this device would improve on that. I saw Roku Streaming sticks for about $20 but I wanted to buy the best quality one available. This device was easy to setup outside of the remote control accidentally turning off my Roku TV in another room. The picture quality is excellent, there is a great selection of apps and I've yet to see any interruption with streaming.  Highly recommended!

  Using these to save money by not having to pay monthly costs for a cable company unit.  However I do not like it as well.  You have to go through the entire process each time I turn it on.  It also runs about a minute later than the cable boxes, which is very irritating.  I have only one hooked up at the present time because of the delay.  I may like it better once the other TVs on this floor are in the same mode.  Prefer the cable boxes but not the price.

  This is my fourth Roku device, I purchased it as a replacement after my previous Streaming Stick+ stopped working one day during quarantine. For some reason, I am repeatedly getting an error message that my device is overheating. I have the issue when it is plugged into the TV directly, as well as when plugged into a surge protector. I’ve tried other plug adapters, and I’ve moved it to different rooms and will get the error periodically regardless of any of those factors. Perhaps it’s just a faulty stick, as I’ve never run into this issue before using my previous Roku sticks and my little express never has the issue either.

  Roku worked well for a year. However, the remote doesn't communicate with the main player anymore. Thinking it was just a broken remote, I spent another $20 for a new one. I followed the steps:1. Remove the power cable from the players, waited 5 seconds then re-connect it.2. I waited for the home screen to appear and insert the batteries into my remote (old and new one).3. I pressed and hold the Pairing button down for 5 seconds until I saw the LED status light to begin flashing.4. I wait 30 seconds for the remote pair with the player.Nothing happens so I repeated steps 1-4 10-11 times. NOTHING. ROKU is terrible! Doesn't last!! I'm not buying another player for it to break again.

  I bought a second Roku because I liked it better than Amazon firestick;  the controls on Roku remote are very intuitive but NOT on Firestick so I found myself constantly turning on the lights to figure out where the controls are on the Firestick; mind you, it is fair to state that I purchased the Roku and Firestick at the same time for both my TV's and use them equally;  I also like the menu much better with the Roku;  I will not be returning the Firestick because it is not broken but it is certainly NOT for me.

  I own a Apple TV, Amazon Firestick, and this Roku stick. I hooked this up to my 4K tv which also has the fire stick and this thing blows it away. I love how the remote can turn my tv on and control the volume so I can do away with the tv remote. The 4K quality is very good. Finally, the tv’s USB port provides enough power so I don’t need to plug it in. Something the firestick couldn’t do.This is hands down the best device on the market.Bonus - you can chromecast through the YouTube app.

  We purchased the Roku to replace Xfinity boxes in our house that they charged rent for.  The Xfinity app they offer works pretty good on the Roku and has saved us a lot of money.  We went with this unit to have one remote to control the tv and the extended wifi range.  It has worked everywhere we setup and like it overall.  There are some corks with the Xfinity app and the function, but that has nothing to do with Roku.....it is the 3rd party app.

  The Roku Stick is an update for our home, and install was fairly quick and easy. The ""stream"" issues are that the company we have for internet and Roku are in a pissing match and we cannot use Roku with that companies app until they resolve their issues. So, have to use the older Roku (which already had the app) until agreement made and can download the app to the newer Roku. You think these companies made enough money already to avoid these kinds of issues, but no.

  Not what it's cooked up to be this Roku stick. There's lots of channels, but the content of the free channels is totally out dated, programs from decades ago and the movies are no block busters, only the pay channels are worth it but it's like having cable but by different providers because.... yes you have to pay.

  I bought this to replace a 2-year-old Roku Express that was getting slow and buggy. Wow, what a difference! The Stick + is so much faster. I love how I can use its remote to turn on/of the TV and adjust the volume. I also love how it stays hidden behind the TV. It was easy to set up and I haven't had any issues. It's also easy to deactivate your old Roku and unlink it from your account.It's important to note that there's a scam going around that wants you to pay $70 to activate multiple Roku devices. This is false. Be sure to go the Roku activation URL directly instead of Googling it. The real Roku won't ask you for money to activate.

  Seems to stream OK. Seems to understand voice requests OK. The mute button on the remote is in the worst possible spot. I am constantly accidentally hitting the mute button. It sucks. I can’t believe I have to scroll through so many advertisements to get to the streaming channels, which are the reason that I even got this thing. I am a many - year fire TV user who is not yet impressed with Roku. I will try it long enough to get in the habit of using it.

  I bought this for my grandma because her cable bill was ridiculous! Her favorite channels and shows were costing more. Now, she can watch all her favorite shows as a decent price and I can support her with any technology issues she may have. It’s pretty simple to navigate and it only took a little while to introduce the process. It also helps that there is Alexa attached because of my grandmas poor eyesight, it helps to just say what she wants done!

  I am glad I upgraded my firestick. My old one was glitchy and starting to get very annoying. The new one gave me new options and more channels (of all things). I am really enjoying the speed and the many options of finding things to watch.

  For under $20 Amazon fire stick lite IMHO is best streaming device i ever owned and here is why.  #1. Price can't be beat.  #2.  So simple to activate that even i had no trouble.  #3.  Alexa voice recognition actually works unlike the Roku's that i previously owned which were more than double the price.  #4.  Simple control buttons and ease of use. I am so happy i tried the fire stick  lite. I highly recommend it , low price, high quality.

  I used this for the TV in my kitchen . I don’t mind clicking  through all menus to get to my channel line up in my xfinity app. But I thought once there I would be able to voice command to another channel and it doesn’t work like that. The voice command is only good to get to different apps. That’s why I gave voice recognition a 3 star rating. But this appliance with xfinity app ( Comcast cable)  allows you to watch your taped shows, on demand, favorite channels ( which need to be set on cable first) all from your roku. It’s pretty cool to not need to pay for a monthly cable box.

  for the past  week, it is a 50 50 shot at having this Roku work.  I know it is not the TV or the connection, because when it doesn't work, I change it out for an Amazon Fire Stick and everything is fine.  I have even swaped it out for a different Roku stick and that one works.  My choice would be a Roku because it controls on/off and volume, which my Amazon Fire Sticks do not.  But the most important thing is to have it work,  Very disappointed, it is my most expensive TV device. and it is too late to return it.

  Much to my wife's bemusement I cut the cable. I promised the great new world of live TV streaming. Well, Roku Streaming Stick + just doesn't deliver. The remote is randomly disconnecting, the stick doesn't always start. I returned one unit thinking I got a lemon and got the same behavior with another unit. It turns out the unit may not like being plugged into the HDMI as it degrades the remote performance. Why the hell is it then designed to plug into HDMI?? So I ordered an extension and run it away from TV. I still have issues with it coming on. This is utterly disappointing.  Two stars because it works well when it works. But random failures to start and remote disconnections are really frustrating. My Cable TV came on when I pressed the button. This should too.

  worked great for about 6 wks, then remote failed, only working maybe 10% of the time and only when 2 feet or less from the receiver, which I can accept if I had an option to return for a replacement because that could just be a 1 off defective remote, however same issue with my other Roku remote. I have 3 in my house 2 do not work after light use for 2 months or less.  I tried all the ""fixes"" multiple times with no success, so 2 stars is probably more than deserved.

  Great product , second Roku device, got the cheapest one about 2 years ago for the living room and got this one for my room since my room is far from the wifi, thought this would be better , and it’s great!! Haven’t used all the features yet but it’s cool I can control my t.v with the Roku remote (on/off and volume) and since I only use my tv for Roku it’s like I don’t need the t.v remote! So it’s one less remote to worry about. Fast and great picture. Can watch all my favs , including all of my anime apps which is fantastic! I am very happy. If I had one complaint it would be that it was supposed to come in a week but it took a little over two weeks. But other then that it’s great.

  I bought 2 Roku Stick+ with the intention of getting rid of cable and going with a streaming service, then discovered our cable is actually cheaper, so, now the thought is to just use the cable's app and return our cable boxes and cancel DVR service since most all my shows are On Demand or on apps anyway. I just love the voice thing that lets you say the name of a tv show or movie or even the name of an app and it finds it. That saves me from having to type everything, and they will pay for themselves with the money I will save from not having the $8 per box rental and $10 DVR fee every month.

  Only recently did I get rid of my cable as the bill for my cable and internet ( package deal) had risen to over 170.00 per month and I just couldn't do it. But by keeping my internet and  using this Roku, I am able to save well over half of that money and get almost everything I could ask for with no extra monthly fees. Yes, there are some channels I could subscribe to for a an extra fee but I don't need them. there are hundreds of movies and dozens of free channels for TV, plus I can. also get anything local on my computer ( weather, news, etc.)  Setup was fast and easy  My only regret is not doing this sooner but then again, I understand that this newest edition os a great improvement over the earlier efforts. Highly recommended.

  I got rid of Directv about 6 months ago and got a Roku and an antenna. After 6 months I have ZERO regrets. I use the antenna to get all my local stations and use Playstation Vue for the other ones. The Roku offers a cloud based DVR which really is not a DVR. It basically will keep the shows in the cloud for x number of days before they drop them but it works fine for me. I use the Vudu app to rent movies and there are many on demand apps that you can use as well.My only complaint (otherwise would be 5 star) is there does seem to be a small audio lag issue with this model. You can fix it by setting the Sound to stereo but it does not seem to be just me. I have googled several times to check forums and it does seem to be a known issue so hopefully Roku will get it fixed.

  I absolutely love Roku. We just switched to Roku and ditched cable for good. We also purchased YouTube TV so we have local stations and the cable stations we previously had. Due to the depressing news I find myself watching Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime shows more than anything else. Make the switch, you won’t be disappointed!

  Bought the Roku Stick received it and hooked it up and nothing it wouldn't even power on so sent that one back and  exchanged it for the same , that one showed up hooked that one up and it does the same thing nothing called Roku Tech and he says try a different TV I said it shouldn't matter what TV or what HDMI port you hook it up to . So to keep the Tech happy I tried a different TV and it didn't work just like I told the Tech it wouldn't work.I told him its pretty bad when you buy a Roku stick and have to call Tech support first thing because you are selling defective crap.

  After an hour long call with tech support, it was determined that my fire stick was non functioning. Got a credit and had to purchase a new one. I do not have Alexa and Amazon does not make a Firestick without that capability. That stinks.

  My son and daughter-in-law gave a Fire Stick for Christmas. What a wonderful gift!  It is easy to use and I really like how I can watch pretty much anything I want to see.  If they had not bought it for me I would have bought one for myself.

  Yippee! Now my parents are able to watch things like Netflix, Disney +, and other things. They are NOT tech savvy but I installed it and showed them a few times and they are pros. It also takes an old TV and makes it able to do the stuff a new one can with a much cheaper price tag. Great product.

  I didn’t know what I bought honestly. My home entertainment system was run by Google and I wanted to try Alexa Firestick. It was on sale and I went ahead and bought it.I didn’t like that I cant control the TV volume with it and there is no volume control in the remote as well. It’s a big deal.It was my fault I didn’t read the description well though and for $18 you cant go wrong. I can live with it.

  Before I used fire TV stick I used a cable to stretch across the room to my computer.  A pain to hook up and put away. Plus a hazard for someone walking through the living room.Now I just change the TV input and bring up the programs I've subscribed to.  Very ease.

  
"

  This one works for now. My experience with these is they don’t last more than a couple of years. Maybe this is because periodically changes the operating code and the remote doesn’t work with the new system and a new fire tv must be purchased. There should be a way to upgrade the remote so it will continue to work

  At first I wasn't sure I wanted or needed one.  Well, I really love it!  I use it a LOT for Amazon music.  It saved my sanity when all of the politic commercials  were on.  I enjoy its many uses, calling people hands free, information that I don't need to turn on my pc or phone to find out.

  I moved into an apartment complex where internet was included. My Roku tv was not connecting to WiFi and I was concerned I’d need to purchase internet with own hardware or buy a new tv with Ethernet. My tv has hdmi so I wanted to try firetv first. I ordered this in the morning and Amazon delivered later that day. I opened the package plugged into my tv and my Roku tv was connected in less than 3 minutes!Thank you Amazon for fast solution to my problem. I’m also loving that Alexa works with this and my echo dot.

  I would like a visual listing of programs with dates and times for selected locations such as Prime App Box.  It takes some time to become comfortable with how everything works.  I have found many things quite by ""accident"".  When in doubt I ask Alexa but even then Alexa doesn't always know the answer. It is challenging at times.  The equipment works as intended but moving around in the apps takes some time to master.  I would purchase Amazon Firestick again.

  I purchased this for my office thinking it would be an easy way for me to stream shows.  I was pleasantly surprises with all of the apps and the included browser.  My Roku stick does not have that.  Neither does my Xfinity app. Very easy to hook up to my home network and use.  Everything came in the box.  Caught it on sale.

  Ok all the features work, however I was hesitant to purchase this one from looking at other people’s reviews. After a month of use, the sound wasn’t working. I checked my tv alone and also with another stick just to make sure. I unplugged the stick and shook it a few times then it worked. A week later there was the same issue. I wish I had kept the box to return. Now will have to buy another.

  I bought this for my upstairs bedroom. I have used Roku many times before but have had an issue with some of the sites buffering because it is so far away from the internet box. This has the long range wireless and seemed to take care of the problem. I don't have the buffering that I had before. Everything is crystal clear. The voice command works very well which is great for my granddaughter when she searches youtube. The channels with Roku are seemingly endless and it's fun to just search around seeing what's out there. If you're thinking about purchasing, this is a really good one.

  I just ordered a 2nd fire stick for another TV.  The functionality and convenience is outstanding.  I was able to load HBO Max and can now watch content from the same without having to cast it from my IPad.  I’m disappointed I did not order one long ago.  It really opens up excellent streaming functions and all with simple voice commands.  Great product!

  The lite version isn’t anywhere near as good as the new firestick with the built in volume controls. We need to manually reset the lite version to get the sound to work every single time we use it the next day. The one with the volume built in controls the TV power and the volume on the sound bar. I wish I’d bought two of the one with sound included but now they aren’t on sale and it’s too late to return the lite.

  Well the one I bought said TV that’s why I bought it. But it doesn’t control me TV nor volume. I didn’t want to be without fire stick any longer than I’d already so that is why I didn’t return it.

  This is not what I thought it would be.I'm not a Technical person so not having a volume button throws me off, and I  still need the cable remote to turn my T.V off and on. But it's ok I guess since I  no longer have cable just internet.

  Tv was set up so Fire TV was a smart tv selection but I did not like the ability to focus on its use alone. So I purchased stick to go in HDMI 2 and it seems to work more easily but it did take a bit of time to get thr smArt tv to accept it.

  Well , I am so pleased with customer serviceI had posted a negative review, Regarding my fire stick because I could not hook it up and a friend could not hook it up. I thought I had a bad remote control and I was just going to count it as a lesson learned. Amazon called me after I posted the review and a sweet young man helped me hook the fire stick up and it is working perfectly so I am so thrilled. It takes an older not so smart TV and turns it into some thing I can really enjoy so I am very pleased with Amazon customer support

  This was easy to install but I needed a little help from my friend on how to get started once it was installed. In these pandemic days we wanted more choices of tv shows and movies  I didn't have a smart tv and the Fire Stick converted my old Samsung tv and I signed up for Prime.  Best thing we could have done.  My husband is watching an episode of Jamestown as we speak.

  Basically, the only thing this remote left off is the tv controls. You can't use the Amazon remote to cut the tv on and off or to control the volume. It requires you to always have to use 2 remote. Didn't realize this was the lite version, do NOT recommend.

  I have owned roku 1, 2s and 3s and ultra, I purchased 3 or 4  of these for the sole reason is that these can control your TV power and volume,  Since I was cutting the cord with cable.  They all have remote problems, one of them I switched to the built in smart TV, 2 of them I went back to a roku 3 and the last one I keep having to go and unplug then reply in. If it's been on for a bit and you don't use the remote for a couple hours, it quits working....on all of them. Maybe they have a conflict with Google wifi

  So me and my girlfriend just moved into our home.  We are first time buyers and are very new to purchasing our own cable and how channels come bundled.  After settling with a tv provider we soon realized that our tier although was 80$ for tv and internet a month .. our favorite shows were considered premium...Now that every show/channel has an app on  Roku we just use our other family members log in who pays for the premium channels and use his log in for the Roku app.  We toss him 20$ for his bill and we get all the channels and shows we want .As far as performance goes .. I would say I’m about 20 ish yards away from my router and I get no lag .  My router is high performing though so results may vary * lol.  Remote is easy to navigate things and it shows a battery charge icon which is nice .  Great buy for family members who don’t have smart TVs .

  I like it a lot. This is my third Roku for a new tv, and the old ones are still working like a champ. I like the Roku over the default webos interface. My only complaint is that the remote will not switch inputs on my TV. I even tried with the voice option to switch inputs and it did not work. If the remote had a switch input option so I could switch to the Xbox without using my other remote, it would have been a full five stars.

  The sound was going out on my TV. Thought it was the TV. Further investigation showed it was the roku. I am constantly having to unplug the device and plug it back in as sound continues to go out.

  I had the first version roku stick for 2 years and had started to get a wide blue line thru picture. Didn't know if it was roku or my TV but ordered roku streaming stick+. Setup was a snap. (I was able to skip thru credit card info - that's VERY offensive to me.) Got thru setup, added new free channels, and my picture is now perfect - no big blues. Seems like original should have had more than 2 year life but I'm happy to have good pic now.  I don't use alot of the bells and whistles but there are some things I will check out. From what I've seen and heard from friends, I'm glad I stayed with roku rather than going to Amazon Fire TV.

  2 services that were hard for me to get are Amazon Prime and Netflix. This Roku addresses those and much more. Set up was easy - system is very intuitive. Wireless ac is a plus as this helps with speed and traffic on my house system. I have a Smart Samsung which has a wired connection to my network, but Netflix was choppy. The Roku seems to provide a cleaner access. My other installation is on an older Runco tv where I enhanced the audio with a soundbar. This was a little bit of a problem as the Runco does not have an HDMI ARC input and the soundbar is wedged between some other components and one of the ""Hints"" is that if you have poor wireless reception, move the Roku away from other stuff. However, the reception is great and all seems good.

  Be careful where you purchase. Roku has no activation fee. Attempted to load this and when tried to set up, hte on screen prompt was to call a 1-800 number that asked for a $80 activation fee. Clearly a scam. Do not purchase this item from this seller.

  After 20 years paying exorbitant fees to the local cable co., I decided to ‘cut the cord’ and I couldn’t be happier. Had I known about streaming sticks before, I would have ditched cable much earlier, but most people still think that cable or dish are the only choices available to them.I’m 59 and use the Roku mainly to watch movies and news, although I’m still exploring the possibilities and finding my way around. I’m glad I can have a lineup of favourite channels in order to avoid those I don’t care about. I’m also very pleased to be able to watch international tv channels through YouTube. One thing I wished, though, is there were more free educational channels available, but I might end up finding them.

  This was an upgrade to the first gen fire tv stick that I had been using for years.  The Fire TV Stick Lite is a lot better.  The menu and programs load a lot faster.  I like the simple remote, however the one thing that could be changed is the location of the guide button, which is right below the play/pause button, because I find myself accidentally clicking it.  The Alexa addition is a nice feature to find shows or movies quickly.  Overall, it was a good purchase.

  We switched from Roku to Amazon Firestick Lite for YouTube Kids access and have had nothing but problems ever since.  We have 2 of them and have to unplug them at least once daily (if not more) because they freeze when they go into slumber.  Profiles won't load or the apps won't load.  It's frustrating, but until Roku gets YouTubeKids we are stuck with these garbage sticks.  Disappointed.

  The one bad thing about this device is that it interferes, actually stopped my television's normal connection to the internet. So in order to watch the NetTV apps installed on my tv I'll have to disconnect the firestick. That's annoying.

  This is my second streaming stick with Roku and I love them! My first was the original which eventually no longer had a compatible replacement remote and began to run slower (still not too bad, just had more times it needed to reload here and there along with Aldo not updating with a few apps) so it was time for a new model... and this one is awesome! Still the same great performance and more!

  So, this is the second one of these we have bought. The first one stopped working after 6 months. Roku never responded for support and Amazon refunded that one. We bought a replacement. This one made it 10 months before it started having issues connecting to WiFi and the remote. Contacted support and they outright said I can't return the item. Amazon won't refund this time.What's amazing is we have a 1st generation Apple TV on the same TV and it still works. So, now that YouTube TV is on Apple TV, we will be switching to that.

  I originally bought this for my bedroom TV, but when it came in, my dad said ""Just hook it up to the TV in the living room. I want to see what it's all about."" Needless to say, it is now my dad's Roku. He guards the remote like it's his job.  He loves it! And my dad is NOT electronic friendly. He can look at a laptop and break it, but the remote for the Roku is so easy to use and now he's discovered how to download APPS! He's in heaven and I have to admit, it's nice to see him enjoying it. As far as the product goes, I couldn't be more pleased. It works just like it's supposed to work. Streaming is smooth, picture is great and the remote is the best remote I have used in years! If I could rate it higher than five stars, I would. :)

  We're very happy with our Roku. We had been using and slowly killing our xbox by having it on non stop and running the apps through there. So the roku hookup and operation is really simple and easy. We have some of the worst internet in the world - we have to use a cell repeater and then got a mobile hot spot with that and we have had zero issues streaming. (We use a tmobile franklin hot spot) I am very very happy with it and highly recommend!

  Bought, used for a month, left alone for 4 months now not working.  ROKU says replace the remote.  BS.  Customer service is email. NO PHONE CONTACT. Convenient. They tell you how to try and reconnect your ROKU. Already tried that and now their recommendation is replace remote.  Really?!  Been there, done that, did that.

  This iteration of the Roku Streaming Stick is outstanding.  It receives our WiFi signal really well even though neither of our two routers is especially nearby.  We don't have problems with skips or picture quality.  The interface runs very fast and smoothly on the SS+ versus our original version Streaming Stick.  Apps start much quicker on the SS+.  Probably the best part for us is that the SS+ remote also operates the basic functions of our TV (i.e. power and volume).  We had previously had a really basic cable box on this TV, and the remote from the cable company didn't operate the TV and it was more of a hassle than we expected to juggle the two remotes.  The Roku Streaming Stick+ was a big ""quality of life"" improvement in that regard.  Also, Roku devices are I believe the only streaming devices that carry the Spectrum TV app, which is vitally important for us since we are Spectrum subscribers.  All in all, we are extremely happy with the Roku Streaming Stick+.

  One year after purchase my only complaint is that it occasionally overheats when watching 4k/UHD even when using the extension cord provided that is designed to correct the overheating issue.  Also my remote occasionally un-pairs itself from the TV.  My workaround is the ROKU app on my phone to navigate the on screen menus to pair it with the TV again.  Friends have operated it and then complained about their Fire TV Sticks crappy operation in comparison to my ROKU operation and selection.  Specifically this has xfinity streaming which is provided via xfinity cable company in this area.

  It’s a great streaming stick. It’s UI is well done and the remote is a joy to use when the batteries are not dead. Which is most times. A fresh set of batteries will be completely drained in 5-7 days even if sitting unused the whole time. I have been through 4 sets of batteries since I purchased it about 2 months ago. Most of my time spent with it I need to use the App because I don’t have that many batteries available to just burn up like that. Working the device through the App is fine but the appeal of the device is the remote itself. So that’s a bummer.

  This has trouble with 4k. Our stick often overheats (yes we contacted roku and they sent an extension stick for it but it still overheats) when we watch in 4k so anymore we don't bother with 4k options. Streams 1080p seemingly fine but we get a much better picture when we stream from our ps4.Alexia works sometimes and it more depends on the app you are wanting it to access.Overall it's great for everyday viewing but for those serious about picture quality save your money. I think the issue comes down to processing power and this small stick just doesnt have it for 4k. I really like the roku remote, the d pad selection and quick buttons makes it real easy and responsive.

  I have a Samsung “smart” TV, but it constantly glitches in connecting to the WiFi, or there’s a lag between turning on the TV and connecting.  There are also streaming quality and continuity issues as well, so even though I have two other Roku ULTRA 4Ks I decided to do a streaming stick because this TV is wall mounted.Works great!  Streaming quality is outstanding and rarely have any issues.  Two things that bug me a little.1) Whenever I turn on the TV, Streaming stick goes thru its boot up sequence where the word “Roku” bounces up and down for a few seconds.  “Doodly-doo, doodly-doo”2) If the stick has been on a while, it gets a little hot.  I wouldn’t ever normally notice this but took it out to plug into my projector and was like “Wow, that’s a little hot.”

  Samsung firmware updates had rendered my wifi and lan connections on my 5yo $2400 smart tv worthless.  Had even installed a new wifi card which worked a couples days until they bricked it also.  First tried and alexa to get my tv back on my network. Networking was unstable so I scapped that idea.  Now I've got a roku and this seems to work much better.  Now I can play my home content on my tv again.  Nice try samsung, I will not be buying another tv from you in this lifetime!  Word to the unwise, if it isn't broke, don't think that a manufacturer is going to make it better. Just say no to firmware updates!

  I have always purchased Apple TVs for my streaming device.  I bought this for a spare bedroom so guests could enjoy movies if they wanted.  I didn't want to spend a bunch for this low usage room so I experimented with this cheap Roku (I see cheap but paid a little extra for the 4K version because of course).Wow, what a pleasant surprise.  Set up was so easy, has everything you could want, connects well to the Wifi even though it is furthest from the router.  Great product.

  For some reason, this new Roku (an upgrade over a cheaper Roku unit) is prone to crashing Sling almost every time I get into a Sling show. It crashes back to the Sling menu within 20 seconds.  Restarting the show seems to work.  A lot of FF and rewind can also cause crashes.  I am using 5 Ghz which seems slightly better than 2.4 Ghz. I have changed channels a few times too, with no improvement.  All other devices using WiFi work fine showing a strong signal well beyond the TV where the Roku is plugged in.

  Very impressed. I have a brick house with concrete walls on the inside of my garage, large over hang outside, 8 inches of snow on the roof and live in an old neighborhood with large trees and I have hills to the north. Local TV tower is 30 miles away to the north. I have 4 foot long large roof antenna in my garage attic that didn't pick up channels unless perfect weather. This powered unit on long range get 39 channels. Only CBS from major networks not picking up.  Buy it

  The Roku stick +  boots up fast and no issues with connection to wifi network.  The only negative thing is the device gets warm to hot to touch sometimes.  We only use the device about 1 hr per day as a secondary tv so the heat issue is not that important.  We fixed some heat issue by hooking up an hdmi extender cable from the tv to roku stick + which seems to remove some of the Heat issues.  Recommend getting 3ft hdmi extender cable with purchase of the roku stick + .

  I've purchased two of these Roku Sticks and am please with how easy they are to install. It took minutes to setup Roku on my Samsung and LG smart TVs. These sticks are nice because they stay out of sight up behind the TV. My older Roku system consisted of a small box that was attached with a cable to my TV. Two criticisms: the remote sold with this new Stick model lacks the headphone jack of the older remote. I liked the option of simply plugging my headphones into the remote. Also, the new remotes also have several buttons for quickly accessing channels like Netflix, Hulu, etc. I am not a fan of these buttons for proprietary/subscription channels. In short the older remote was better - simple and easy to use with headphones.

  Followed all their troubleshooting steps and the remote wouldn't pair with the stick. Customer service - which despite being through email - is based in India and they seem unable to understand the concept of ""not pairing"". Instead they try to deflect by continually asking questions I've already answered and saying they're trying to check if my brand new device is still under warranty.There are plenty of other choices for streaming devices, so returned this.

  Not entirely Roku's fault I suppose but my main reason behind purchasing this unit was so I could get and use the Spectrum cable app for my cable subscription.  Apparently Spectrum likes the streaming option nowdays.  But after using it for a minute, I realized there is no way to direct dial your channels.  You have to bring up the guide and scroll through it to get to what you want.  I place this one 50-50 on each.  The remote could use buttons and Spectrum could have built a numerical keypad of some kind into their app.

  I purchased a ROKU to be rid of a second cable box in my bedroom.  Well to my surprise and with the help of a tech smart friend I not only got rid of the second cable box on a TV I don't watch, but I was able to get rid of the expensive upgrade things which brough my bill down.  I am very untechy it is a family joke . I can barely send e-mail. However, I can mange the ROKU just fine and have improved my tech self image.

  The box smelled like mold, but I tried to install the Roku anyway.  It took several minutes to enter a single character during setup.  After an hour, I gave up.  I returned the unit for a replacement, which arrived today.  I did not open it, because I could smell mold.I have bought several Roku sticks over the years for myself and family, so I know how this works.  What is going on?  How is it that I received two moldy smelling units?

  I love Roku! Unlike some people, I really like the simple home page where I clearly can scroll through my apps without ads and recommendations. The voice thing is really nice, as my LG TV remote doesn't come with that smart function.  You can ask: ""show me films with Michelle Williams"" and it will give you a list of all the films available ranging from free to paid, in order of price. This is a much, much cheaper alternative to Apple TV and I love it!

  Not using voice recognition. wanted to get rid of satellite dish and cable and after a lot of research I decided on the Ruko Streaming stick  it works great no interruptions easy to install and after getting Hulu live + and netflix  I am set.  I get football and all other sports and thousands of shows and movies to watch.  I am saving over 5 hundred dollars a year.  No more climbing on roof in winter to clean snow off satellite dish and all show are in HD.  I am so happy I got a second one for the other room.  If there is a down side that would be it you need one for each tv you own Happy Watching

  Worked wonderfully for about 6 weeks. Then nothing but problems. Went and got a second Roku, that one was better and lasted a little longer but then the remote stopped working. Had to buy a new remote. That new remote worked for about 2 months then stopped working again. Terrible unresponsive customer service and unable to RMA for replacement. Waste of money.The device started to not stay powered on. The screen will flicker off, and after about 10 seconds turn back on again, then 10 seconds later will turn off. The only way to fix this right now seems to be that I need to unplug it from the back of my receiver and power it off completely for about a minute to reset it before it starts working again for about a day.This doesn't give me much faith in the QC. Not sure if it is overheating or if the software is just very buggy. I wonder if Roku has a fix for this.

  Used to have the Chromecast but never again. I love love love the Roku. My only complaint is that I can stream things from my Mac, these tech companies need to put their petty conflicts aside and put the customer first for once. Also, I don't trust voice activate remotes since they most likely are listening in on you. I always take out the batteries of my remote when using the Roku so no one can listen in on me. Other than that the Roku has it all. The best apps and most options. If you're trying to choose between all your streaming device options choose the Roku 💯

  We tried to set this up in our home, we’re already Roku fans. We paired the remote and then proceeded to connect to our WiFi. The remote would respond for a few clicks of use and then stop responding. We reset and followed all of the instructions several times over. After an hour of trying we decided to return it.

  I purchased 2  Roku Streaming Stick+ in November 2020 I put the batteries that came with in and set them up. Went back to use after about a week the batteries were dead in both remotes So I put another set in and they were dead in less than a week only 1 use. Took forever to get any customer service from ROKU (TOTALLY USELESS) but finally got two new remotes 1/31/21 put new batteries in and dead a week later. Now it's past the time to send back so i'm stuck a CRAPPY PRODUCT and TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE to deal with. DON'T BUY........ UPDATE 03/07/2021 After finally getting some help from customer service and plugging the ROKU into an outlet the remotes are working and not eating batteries.

  In all of my tvs, the roku stick will not fit requireing ordering an extension cable, the probnlem is that in order to get the extension cable you have to provide the Roku device serial number, wastin 2-3 more days. What good is it to irder with Amazon Prime when in order to use the Roku you have to order and wait several more days to use the Roku stick.Because we are used to the Xfinity interface with channel numbers we find the Roku interface more difficult.Lastly the mut switch is right next to the volume controls thus I seem to always hit the mute function whenever I try to adjust the volume.

  This ROKU is a game changer. It is surprising easy to set up.  Picture quality is better than cable. So I finally cut the cord and saved $230/ month by disconnecting cable and just using their internet services. I spend $50 a month on HULU, Discovery Plus, Netflix and amazon prime all with out commercials. Just love it. Strongly recommend!!! I have 3 Roku devices throughout the house and can play all my apps at no extra charge.

  If you like to surf the channels, good luck. Takes forever to find your channel and then there is a long lag before loading the show. Once it starts, it streams seamlessly but it drove me crazy waiting to have a show load. Don't waste your money.

  Item is defective. Constantly shuts off volume and requires a system reboot. Won’t allow you to exchange as described. Makes you go in circles when you request the exchange once purchased, then requires you to talk to an agent... THEN Customer service blows and requires 21 troubleshooting questions as well as your address and CC info to request an exchange. Do NOT buy from this vendor. Shady as f***.

  This fire stick really kicks other smart tools I've used in the past such as Chromecast. For example, Chromecast will only let you cast into the tv... and that's it, however, Firestick has a pretty UI with apps and even games.Everything is really smooth to use and Alexa's voice recognition is a beauty. Say anything and Alexa will look for it. Once again this is the best option to make your TV into a smart TV.*I used on my RCA smart TV because there is no way it can compete with the firestick.

  I'm a low-tech old lady with Lyme Disease and did NOT mean to get Amazon Prime and have little use for this item. Tried a few times to figure it out but didn't get far. A friend helped me at least use it once, but I'm out of touch with movies even (and more so tv), so didn't like the selection much. Wanted to see the Tom Hanks movie about Mr. Rogers but not available without paying mucho. Watched something the system SAID was a comedy, My Uncle Frank, and it was not even remotely funny. During these Sad Times I so need humor.

  This Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite was a gift to enable streaming on an older non-smart TV, and for that function it has been outstanding.  The menus leave much to be desired, but the voice remote can be surprisingly good (I have not tested Alexa compatibility).  Setup is fairly simple. As an inexpensive route to stream, the Fire TV Stick Lite has performed admirably and, thus far, reliably.  I intend to update this review once I explore more options

  I have issues since I got it. I even contacted customer support with no resolve. It needs unplugged and plugged back in each time I turn on the tv. It needed registered over and over again. It keeps throwing me out of Hulu and the screen gets crazy quite often as well as many other issues. I have four other fire sticks and no issues with any of them. This one must be a dud

  I have been using a PS3 for at least 8 years to stream media through Netflix, then Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube, but this year Sony will stop updating the Playstation Network for PS3, so they have no way to stream Disney Plus. Also I feel the security for your electronic billing just won't be there. As we aren't gamers, and a new Playstation is hundreds of dollars, this was a quick and cheap fix. Set up was pretty easy. Interface is incredible. Streams smooth as can be with no lag. Image quality is outstanding. I'm really happy with this purchase.

  I've had cable, I've had dish. A couple of years ago I bumped up my internet package and switched to streaming. I'm so happy I did. I have a Roku on every TV. My favorite model is the Ultra, but I put these in my office and the bathroom. I can enjoy Netflix, Sling, Apple TV+, Disney +, and so many more. The remote is easy, the interface is easy to figure out. I even got one for my mom and she loves it. My only gripe with the streaming sticks is they seem to buffer more than my Ultras. I like things neat and tidy though, so I like that they are invisible behind the TV.

  My six year old Sony Smart TV was starting to get dumb - streaming channels took awhile to load up, would frequently lose connection, and always started on the TV antennae input despite rarely watching it (I had to watch Judge Judy until everything loaded up!). I thought maybe I needed to buy a newer TV. This device solved all those problems. And the remote has all the buttons on it that I typically use. Watching TV is no longer a frustrating experience!

Also being able to turn on my Tv and volume is excellent. Had to use tv remote with the cheaper one also.I highly recommend this Roku device to everyone both Family and Friends.

  ***Wish I saw the reviews FIRST***I ordered this 12/13/20 and it arrived today 12/16/20. Fresh out the box and I was so excited to use this—unfortunately that did not last long. This device won’t connect to ANY of my WiFi networks and when it finally tries to connect to one.. it keeps restarting itself and updating. It never moves past the “Let’s Get Started” portion. I have been sitting here for the past few hours connecting and reconnecting this thing to no avail. Highly upset because I was truly excited to use this. Will be returning ASAP!

  The remote control to this device is so sensitive that if you said it down the wrong way it will turn off your stick. Also, the volume down button on mine sticks and often turns it all the way down. Perhaps they should spend a little more time on quality control.

  I bought this on a whim and assumed the claim that it would still work good with a bad wi-fi connection would prove false. So glad I was wrong, I have the worst internet imaginable, the cheapest you can find, and yet this Roku never slows down and although there are moments where the video quality suffers, it always fixes itself in a matter of seconds. I'm honestly amazed at how great this device works, to the point where I'm wondering if witchcraft is involved somehow. My only regret is not buying a Roku stick sooner, if you have crap wi-fi this is a must-buy

  I tried to hook it up and it won't go past the point of me entering my email address....  I rebooted and started over and each time this is where it gets stuck.  I am not able to do anything after this point.  The online support was horrid.  The guy initially said the Remote is defective and when I said I am using the remote, so that can't be the problem, said well the Roku is defective and would be sending another device in 3-5 business days.  So far no email from them indicating they are doing this.  They instead sent one suggesting I complete my set up by choose my streaming channels etc.

  I had a 2012 46"" Smart television that was having serious issues loading Netflix.  I contemplated buying a new television, but thought I would try using a Roku stick.  I am so glad I did.Roku picks up so many different channels and loaded Netflix immediately. It even allowed me to load a themed background for the menu screen.  The remote works on both the Roku stick and the television volume/power.  Perfect for my guests in the room.It is only the first day so far, but I am giving it great marks unless something happens.

  Last Month I made the decision to fire my overpriced satellite dish provider and jump in the streaming TV wagon. I needed to find something that was reliable and very easy to use to avoid a potential TV/new technology crisis with the wife.Reading all the great reviews on this brand,  I Decided to take a chance on ROKU, I have not looked back.My wife and kid absolutely love it and once I set everything up it took them about 90 seconds to learn how to use it.We love these so much we bought 2 more for our bedroom TV's.This Roku stick+ is easy to program. Fantastic 4K picture, so inconspicuous and unobtrusive. Simply an amazing product that I highly recommend.

  Great Product. Just as advertised. The only difference between the $29.99 version (Fire Stick Lite) and the $39.99 Fire Stick is the volume button. The cheaper one doesn’t have it. You really don’t need it because you can control the volume with your tv remote. I have both and would recommend either one.

  I purchased two-- one for the bedroom and one for the living room. Good price and works well. Obviously, as described, it does not come with volume control so you will need to be mindful to keep the remote for the volume nearby.

  If you have Hulu Live make sure to keep your software up to date or it will work correctly. Also spend the extra money and get the Firestick with the volume and tv control.I am updating my review of this product. The thing has turned out to be worthless and would not recommend it to anyone. If you are trying to watch live tv such as Hulu Live and especially sports it is totally worthless. It keeps rewinding itself and will not come out of it and the same plays keep repeating. Save your money and buy something else. Mine is currently collecting dust in a drawer.

  Very good integration with my Amazon account and apps and add on’s. Remote has a good range, with good latency and nary a lag.Streaming quality is very good, with 4K programming coming in great.Simple to install and setup, simple and intuitive to use, great user interface.Haven’t used the voice recognition or Alexa integration that much, so can’t really attest to it.On the whole, a decent solid streaming choice.

  Before I purchased the firestick..I asked a few friends for advice on these things because I am not smart about this stuff. I went with the firestick for both mine and my husband's tv. We are both happy with this item. I got rid of a $111.00 dishnet bill and I am down to $20.00 for all the channels I watch. I AM VERY HAPPY!!!!

  I switched from the Amazon Fire stick to the Roku after I got a Roku Tv and I love this stick! It can plug straight into the tv so I don't have a long cord to the outlet, which is incredible. The user friendly design and functions make Roku my favorite streaming device. Clean, quick, and to the point, I would recommend the Roku to anyone considering streaming!

  No Bluetooth, my first time using roku and this is the first time I use this kind of device without Bluetooth. 5ghz wifi only works with 20Mhz. 40Mhz and 80Mhz are not working. this problem decreases the internet speed by 3/1.Limited applications can be installed on this device.It's not like Android.i am using a monitor, i cannot turn the volume on or off and it is silent and the device does not turn off. Because it doesn't support.I wanted to connect it to the other TV, unfortunately I noticed the roku device was longer than necessary. HDMI extension cable is required and is not included in the box. I know the HDMI cable is given free but I am not in America, I asked, I was told it could only be delivered to America.Frankly I'm not satisfied, unfortunately I got it from research, I didn't think it would be like this.My rating for the product is 2My rating for Amazon is 5

  This is actually the 2nd roku I bought to replace my 1st roku. With in a week of using it, the roku remote controller starts to ""have a mind of its own"". Sometimes, pressing any of the arrow button jumps to voice search, sometimes to new channel installation.  Now just after 3 months, the remote totally gave up. I have tried changing the batteries, pressing the reset button. All failed. I replaced my 1st roku also because of the remote: frequently used keys requires very heavy pressing to work. But after 3+ years of usage, that's understandable. But the new Roku remote kaput w/in just a couple of months that sucks!!

  Been using for several weeks now via a wifi extension with no problems. Easy Install -  Roku has many options under it's own site.. Lot's of other optional sites available and can add many more. We basically have added Youtubetv (could make you consider cutting the cable cord with this alone), added Netflix, and Prime Video. We live in stormy area and  hurricane zone. Satellite TV goes down more often from June to Oct due to storms...Cable TV has become much more expensive, Internet stays up more reliably. AND, is cost effective.

  I own this Roku TV stick for less than 8 months and the remote is no longer working. I replaced the batteries and tried to reconnect the remote to the stick but nothing works. Their phone number is the worst too as I can’t get to speak to customer service representative either!Update: I finally talked to a representative and they are sending a HDMI cable extension as a potential solution.Update 2: The short HDMI cable extension solution worked! 5 starts for Roku's customer service!!!

  I spent the extra to get the dual band coverage, extended range, and the ability to control my TV.  Signal strength is very good, and the setup is easy, including the TV control, which is done with an auto-detect.  As well, the size will make this Roku very nice for travel.And now I just bought my second stick, for another TV, after using the first stick for over a year.  My TiVo and Samsung Smart TV apps have always been buggy, whereas the Roku just works perfectly all the time, and has a lot of apps the TiVo and Samsung TV do not.  I've had other Roku's over the years, but this stick is the best by far.

  Have been using the Roku Streaming Stick+ for about 2 weeks now and I have to say this by far is the best Roku for our needs. We have two other Roku players in the house. The new Streaming Stick+ is being used in our basement gym and the wireless connection has not given us one bit of trouble even though it is a floor away and on the other side of the house from the router. I love that the remote also controls the tv volume and power. This is a great feature so you only have to deal with one remote. I generally only use the Roku for exercise apps and it is working flawlessly. I would highly recommend the Roku Streaming Stick+. An added benefit is that you could take the stick anywhere, vacation, friends, etc.

  I love love my Roku Streaming Stick Plus. Purchased about a year ago. However, in the past month or so, I have been having very frustrating problems with it. Won't open up home page, doesn't respond to anything using remote even after putting in new batteries. I have to unplug router, unplug power to Roku stick, changed HDMI port, and so on. Also there is now a problem with audio syncing with streaming video. Off sometimes by 2-3 seconds. The return date has come and gone. I have an older Roku stick bought in 2014 that works better! Quite disappointed.

  This was $29 on Amazon and it's a great bargain. I don't see much difference in performance compared to the 2017 Roku Ultra I have on a different TV. The remote is smaller and clumsier to handle. It does not have a jack for headphones but that was not important. Hookup to an unused HDMI input and a USB port on the TV was easy and neat. My channels from the Ultra were ported over so I was up and running quickly.

  It didn't take 24hrs to realize this Roku Streaming Stick + is worthless. The video was stair stepping and I thought I had setup something wrong with my set, AND THEN I saw all the reports of overheating, just like the original streaming stick. This is pure garbage and Roku knows it is. Their Quality Control is nonexistent. Customers going through the trouble to take the case off and drill holes to remove heat, or putting heat sinks on the control is a sign this is a horrible product.

  This is how products are supposed to be. The packaging was exceptional from function to aesthetics. Instructions and setup process were seamless, intuitive and simple. It's easy to use, even for technophobes. I was deciding between Roku, ChromeCast and a few other options. It was the reviews I read that steered me to Roku, and I have no regrets. So far, it seems like it was the right decision.

  I'm a big fan of Roku. We have them on four TVs since we canceled cable TV.  Some are wired, others wireless.  I love that you can cast your laptop screen to them.  Took one star away because I still can't get Kodi working on it and I've never been able to get their media player to play movies from my file server.

  This little device saves me about $100 a month! I stream all of our Netflix, Hulu, Disney +, and Amazon Prime videos, as well as watch the news from CNN and you can download all different ""stations""  some you'll need to pay a subscription and some are FREE. I also downloaded a free app to ""Screen Share"" photos from my phone. Would totally recommend it! 5 stars

  I bought an older one a whole ago and wanted to get a second one for another room in the house so I got this one, which is supposed to be faster. It was a night and day difference between the two with the speed. Granted, this is an updated product, I ended up buying a second one of these for a different room!The speed is great and the connection is much improved. When it starts up, it's quick to go to the main menu with the apps.I may be crazy but I may be a third one for my Samsung Smart TV because there's more apps on the Roku!

  Took a bit to get it installed (1.5 hours - the instructions aren't the clearest), but after installed it's really great and easy to use.  Particularly the voice feature - we just call out the name of the movie we want to watch and it searches several sites to find it.

  Work great for hotels and dorms. WiFi can only be used through your cell. If the WiFi needs a password like inside your home it connects easy. If your in a hotel or college dorm room where you have to except the terms and conditions and use thier code you need to use your cell phone to connect no it dose not use your data if it’s connect to WiFi from ur cell. Turn off data just in case on your cell. Mirroring iPhone to Roku is not possible. Android works only! iPhone dose have the remote app android too. Only thing you can’t do with an iPhone with Roku is watch stuff off your cell.

  Roku is far and away the best streaming hardware we have used.  We also have an AppleTV and a FireStick, but Roku is more user-friendly, the remotes are laid out better, and the availability of apps is superior to the competition.  Apps seem to take longer to get support or added than on the other options.The voice recognition is great, too.  I wound up replacing one of our Roku tv remotes with the new voice remote, and pairing was very easy.

  I have an integrated smart TV that delivers 4k flawlessly in my house.  I have numerous computers and tablets which deliver streaming content without issue in my house.  For this Roku 4k device I had a specific need for it in my home theater room.  Thought it would be great for Amazon HD audio (which does work fine btw) and streaming 4k with Atmos for Disney + and Netflix 4k with Atmos.  This unit does neither.  In fact there is a posted forum discussing the issue with Disney incapabilities and the Roku folks have  stated there is no fix imminent.  Wish I could return but it I passed its return time.  Hate it when products fail to deliver on the key element for which I purchased it.

  This stick gets extremely hot!!! Super hot after a few minutes of being plugged into HDMI port.Fire hazard!  Or hazard to tv!!!Had same problem with roku 2 box that connected via cable!!Would not recommend.Easy to connect and set up but such high heat coming off a device is not worth my tv or home burning down.Amazon Fire Stick - no such problems!  No high heat where connected to tv HDMI port or at outlet.

  Nice idea and great picture but has major overheating and reliability issues. Indicated 113C (235F) during a true 4K stream after receiving on screen overheating warning. Routinely runs over 100C with 720/1080p feeds. Subsequently, remote functionality became, and has remained, intermittent and also experienced periodic screen blanking (out) on brand new Samsung 4k set, with no previous issues. Returning to Amazon. This was stated as a refurbed/like new model from a highly rated seller, however, the only Roku I'd consider, at this point, is the Ultra 4k, which runs 30-40 degrees cooler than this stick. Rated 1 Star due to above issues.

  Excellent, Excellent product! I highly recommend the Amazon Firestick over any other streaming device. You can search for any programs with Alexa. The Amazon Firestick gives you more programs to choose from especially with Amazon Prime. 10 stars out of 10! It was easy to hook up and connect. I had NO technical issues with the Amazon Firestick. Thank you Amazon!

  Sometimes doesn’t give all options for apps you can watch a show on. Especially if it’s free on Netflix and not anywhere else it will show up for everywhere but the place it’s free. Have one for each of my grandmothers and they love being able to watch any show at any time.

  Well worth the sale price of $18, this will turn any TV with HDMI-in into a Smart TV, running an Amazon-skinned version of Android that is compatible with many native Android apps, and even more if you sideload. What's not to love? One of my favorite purchases of the holiday season so far.

  The customer should be able to read the terms & conditions BEFORE DOWNLOAD,so if you agree ok if not then the customer should be able to go BACK and continue their business with out all the bull.then after thinking about it then go back to the app and download it,I feel that I'm being forced to accept!

  I like it.  The usb port does not keep the stick charged so it is still plugged into the wall (I think this is roku error not tv, just needs more power than they like to think), which kind of defeats why I got it,  so I didn't have to run cables through wall BUT the reason I kept it is that the remote does not have to be in direct sight like other roku types AND the remote also works tv volume and power. You don't have to see roku sitting around a tv hanging on the wall. Streaming speeds are great, no buffering on wifi.

  I've had my Roku Streaming Stick since last July. About a month ago the remote's connection with the stick kept dropping. I did everything to connect it. I took out the batteries: reset the stick; undid the power. I tried everything. It would work for 2 days, and the connection would drop again. I wasted nearly $70 buying this stick. I'll never buy another Roku Streaming Stick again. I will try the older box type Roku. Seems to be more reliable.

  It's a Roku.  Their interface is responsive and easy to use.  Being a more open platform some of the channels you can get can be something someone threw together than may not be well designed or have good content, but the mainstream apps are all fantastic and the ease of setup and ease of use of Roku is exceptional, especially for the price!.  I actually think their remote is more comfortable and easier to use than the last Apple TV I purchased.  4k and I like having TV and volume control on the remote, compare the different models to make sure you get the features you want.

  I have been using Chromecast the past year +. I eventually bought 4 when I dropped DirectTV (very worth it!). I was unhappy with the continual buffering during sporting events and the fact that it wasn't easy for my wife to figure out. I bought the Roku and am extremely happy! It is very easy to initially set up and you need to spend some time linking the channels that you want to add to it, but once that is done is works extremely well. The picture quality is excellent (I have a 4K tv) and it is extremely easy to use. I will be incorporating these onto my other tv's.

  Don’t buy it. Was good for 1st month and now it keeps over heating and I did all they said to restart, was away from the TV and connected to my AVR. Did customer service trouble shooting and they said I have another data running alongside that may be contributing to the over heating. Outside my return warranty.My 4K stick from Amazon is much better and runs cool. I used to like Roku, but this stick just doesn't work well. Get the Amazon 4K streaming stick instead.

Needs to be restarted frequently and had to replace the remote after one month.

  The TV where this Roku Stick is used is far away from the router, so I went with this version of the Roku and it did not disappoint! There are no issues with streaming despite how far it is from router, and the remote works well, even 25-30 feet away from the TV. I bought a second Roku for use in the room where the router is located, but not the + version because I didn't think it was needed. That one has trouble getting a signal through the TV which is about 6 feet away. Get this version instead and you won't be disappointed.

  I like this for the compact design, but the WiFi range is pretty poor. When my laptops and phone can easily get signal from my router, this thing struggles. So I need to connect my phone to WiFi, then hot spot the connection to the Roku. Not ideal, but it works. Other than that, I have issues with the remote going haywire sometimes for minutes on end. Possibly the Roku having issues or the remote not projecting the signal out strong enough. New batteries didn't fix.

  Edit:  The first couple months of having the Roku was great.  Now however, the remote has quit working.  I've changed the battery, tried repairing it to the TV and tried it on a different TV.  Nothing works.  So I downloaded the roku remote app on my phone which worked for a while.  Unfortunately, it has become really hit or miss.  Sometimes one or the other remote will work, I'll watch a show and when I try to change the channel or turn the TV off the remote will no longer work.  It's very frustrating.I love my new ROKU!  I was using a firestick and had problems all the time.  I finally decided to try a ROKU, and I'm so glad I did.  We'll be putting a ROKU on all of our tvs!

  Bought the Roku after I was fed up with the FireTV's lackluster performance.  CNNGo would regularly buffer and cough up error messages (even though none of the other devices, e.g. Apple TV on my network had any issues. No such issues with the Roku - works like a charm.  Trashcan, meet FireTV....

  It does the job of streaming great content and then some.  I never owned a Roku before but had different older streaming devices.  Friends of mine do have a Roku so I knew what to expect.  One reason I did get a Ruku over other streaming devices is you're not limited to content because a certain device isn't brand owned or is a competitor service.  Another benefit of this model is  portability so if I ever go somewhere I can have most of my content and services.  The main reason I described I needed a streaming device I my Bluray player does not support Disney+ nor a few other services I use like the Xfinity app.  My brand new 4K 50"" Vizio TV in my bedroom also doesn't support Disney+ or other services as well but does have different Casting options ( Chromecast,  Apple Airplay) but not everyone knows how to do that.Con:  nothing to do with the physical product but you need Credit card information before to even setup an account to use the device.

  The Roku was easy to set up and I did so before going on a two week vacation in Mexico at a resort with it. Picture quality was fine and it is easy to use. You have to consider other factors however such as the Wifi speed and ability to plug it into mounted screens. The free Wifi was fortunately good except during prime time in the evening when people at the resort were more likely to be using the Wifi for computers or other purposes. The TV was cable connected so that wasn't a factor but in a hotel where the TV also depends on WiFi you may have to purchase a faster plan. One of the TV's was mounted and it was difficult to plug the Roku stick into the side plug. Also, Hulu was not available outside of the US so take into consideration whether the service you want to stream will do so internationally. Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO and the like were all fine. Good and easy to use product but set it up at home and on your computer before taking it with you out of town.

  I upgraded to this model last June after my first Roku stick kept failing due to connectivity issues. At first, this one worked well in my basement TV room, but over the last few months it’s been more and more unreliable — by now Prime won’t load at all, Netflix cuts out frequently, and even Hulu sometimes fails to load. The promised “4x the Wi-Fi strength” is nonsense. I assume there’s a planned obsolescence strategy in play and a new “improved” and more expensive version will soon appear or I’ll be obliged to invest in a Roku TV. It’s a shame there aren’t more competitors in the streaming device market to keep standards higher.

  Until Roku addresses the battery drain issue with their remotes, I can not recommend the Streaming Stick+. Drains batteries about every 2 weeks. This is a known problem by them for over a year and still no fix. Go to the Roku Community Forum and read page after page of complaints. CS is no help. All they will say is their engineers are working on it.

  This is a rare find that does exactly what it says. I have a TV in my bedroom at the far end of the house from wifi router. Streaming, especially YouTube, was always hit or miss. This stick and remote installed with no drama and now the TV streams instantly. The difference from the old stick is astounding. My only complaint is the position of the Mute button on the remote. Care must be taken when scrolling not to hit Mute.

  When I first bought this Roku stick, I was blown away. I was getting 4K video, plenty of apps, and a simple user interface, all for a low price. I couldn't figure out how Roku had pulled this off. Well, now I know--by cutting corners on their hardware. In the past year, I have gone through not one, not two, but THREE failed Roku remote controls. Every single one has spontaneously stopped working within a few months (and before you ask, yes, I tried changing the batteries, thank you). At this point, after buying the Roku stick and now a fourth remote control, I've spent enough money that I could have bought an Apple TV. And frankly, that's probably what I should've done in the first place.

  I love my Roku streaming stick! It has great streaming speed and quality and it’s easy to set up and use. This was a fantastic solution for me because I don’t have a smart tv but I wanted to be able to use my apps on my tv. Thank you Roku! The stick can also be used on laptops, etc. Anything with an HDMI port (although it’s probably redundant on a laptop or other device). I highly recommend the Roku Stick to anyone needing an easy solution to not having a smart tv!

  We have a 2016 OLED from LG which is great but the app selection doesn't include all streaming services. In addition the interfaces can be chunky and the apps are updated slowly.  The Roku has everything, has a better interface and simple remote that gets the job done, possibly better quality than the native TV apps and is cheaper than other options (i.e. apple TV). The only thing I miss is airplay for sharing a phone screen. Amazon fire stick is similar but it seems the Roku has wider streaming options since it isn't aligned with it's own Prime streaming service - and the Roku won't try to ""push"" their own shows.

  I love Roku. I use them on everyone’s tv in the house. It’s the best streaming device I’ve had. Easy set up and easy to use. Has apps for everything you would want to stream. I’ve never had a problem with the roku not working properly or loosing connection. Cut cable and stream on a roku. This roku allows you to play around with volume and the one in my room is older and doesn’t have that’s I’m jealous.

  This is the 4th Roku I've owned. Bought it to replace a Roku 3 that had a broken remote. Was tired of using the phone as a remote. The Roku 3 was in a spot fairly far away from my router so I decided to go for the streaming stick+ because of its claimed stronger wifi. Well, guess what... The streaming stick+ barely connects and constantly downgrades the stream due to the poor connection. It is in the same exact spot as the Roku 3 on the same exact network. In fact, I can plug the Roku 3 back in and it works fine with a good connection. The supposed stronger wifi is a downgrade from years old technology. Don't buy.

  I was trying to replace my Fire tv since Amazon is going downhill.  I thought I purchased the one that supports a headset, but that feature got lost in all the other features you have to look out for.  Then I realized the reason they have a headset jack on some of their models is because they don't support blue tooth.  Function of the buttons on the remote are also very spongy compared to fire tv.  You have to push the buttons several times and point the remote in the right direction to get it to work.  In today's day of electronics, this needs to go back to the 1980's.  Roku should be ashamed of themselves.

  I had trouble and had to hire someone to come in and set up the Roku.  After several tries, he got it working, but it buffered every few minutes.  I bought a new router and that seemed to fix it.  Now, after it working from January 1, 2019 it quit working on May 15th.  I tried everything, new batteries in the remote, rebooting my smart TV, rebooting the router.  Hired the tech guy AGAIN, he unplugged and plugged it back in 5 times and then it worked.  When I turned off the TV for the night, the next day it wouldn't work again.  I even tried it on a different TV.  HOW DO I GET MY $58.00 back?????

  First, it would like to get to know the other devices it attached to, TV for example. I have an older 1080p 43"" Panasonic (7 years) took a few goes to get the vol set up, will power the tv up but not close it. Every internet TV program service needed me to go to my PC and put in a code to make it work, units programs have nice touches but really not needed, screen saver, themes. Overall not impressed. Amazon has a better product, but it has faults too. By the sounds of the customer service horror stories shop with amazon products IMO. you'll get a better all-round package

  I purchased this simply due to the addition of the mute button.  My previous Roku worked fine, but for me the cost of a new one was worth it just for the mute button.The downside of Roku is the buttons for Sling, etc, that I don't use but periodically, which is highly annoying.  If they would make these so that they could be disabled or reprogrammed, this would have been a 5-star review.

They also offer to have me scrounge up a box and task the $18 item to the post office, so they could do a refund. I did neither. Frankly I thought they should just send me a working replacement or credit my account.

  There is nothing blocking the ventilation of my streaming stick +, and I am sure that it is connected properly. Yet and still, my SS+ continues to overheat when playing 4K Video!! I don’t know if I received a faulty stick or not, but this is unacceptable!UPDATE: still overheats when connected to my 4K TV, but doesn’t overheat on my regular HDTV. Same amount of ventilation. I bought it for 4K, so the fact that I can’t use it for what I bought it for really sucks. I even ordered their little extender thing and it still overheats.

  I didn't realize just how slow my old Roku HD was until I got this for a different TV.  This thing is blazing fast to navigate.  Reasonably small, so you can travel with it and watch your DVR or Netflix from your hotel.Range is excellent.  I actually have it at the opposite end of the house from my router, but there's been absolutely no issue with it at all, I'm very impressed (in comparison the Samsung TV that it's plugged into has 'smart' features that barely work).I'm now toying with replacing my Roku HD with one of these, even though there's nothing wrong with it - it's just so slow in comparison.Y.M.M.V.

  I just had knee surgery, and can not sleep very well.  I end up sleeping on the recliner because it supports my leg.  The noise of the tv makes me sleepy, which is great, so I would leave the tv on all through the night. After doing that for about a week, I started losing streaming channels.  And after a few days of that, I could not lock on to any channel.  My other roku's on my other tv's worked fine. But if you have it on continuous for a week, to my surprise, it burns it out.

  What a disappointment.  This is my third, maybe fourth Roku.  Have always been a fan.  Bought this, plugged it in, followed the instructions, the unit updated itself, I chose auto-resolution, and now it is blank.  I have a black screen. If I reboot the stick, i get a welcome screen (dancing ROKU letters) then a black screen.  I have a 4k LG tv.  This should not be happening.  Searching online shows lots of others with the same issue, and no apparent fix.  My only hope is that there's an auto-update and the matter is resolved.

  Our Fire TV stick was slow and glitchy. I gave this Roku stick a whirl and am still very happy. As of right now, there are the things it does better than Amazon Fire Devices:1. Has a native YouTube app (FireTV does not)2. You can use YouTubeTV app (Amazon / Google fights)3. Phone app allows headphone use (not available with FireTV right now)4. There is a CometTV app (none on FireTV)5. Pretty much faster in every way.6. Resolution control - if you have an ISP with a data cap, you can set this to only 720p.One thing I do not like is the Roku Plex app. The Plex app for FireTV is far better.

  This thing is great. I was using my PS4 as a primary streaming device and my Netflix experience varied from “I think that’s a person but it’s hard to tell” to absolute microwaved garbage. I plugged this in and it was a night and day difference. Before Roku, I couldn’t even load a lot of shows or it took a long time to even see them in the Netflix dashboard. Now they load almost instantaneously and without any buffering mid-episode or drop in quality. I went from kind of being able to stream 1080p to easily streaming 4K UHD HDR content with no issue. I’ve been traveling for the last week or so and the Roku stick is amazing for hotels. Once connected to the hotel WiFi it’s as solid as at home and brings your ability to relax after a long day of “vacationing” to a whole other level being able to watch shows you’re actually interested in, instead of grainy hotel cable. I found that the Roku is a more powerful device than the TVs in the hotel rooms in which I stayed, meaning it can push higher quality content than crappy hotel TVs can even accept, creating a bottleneck at the tv. If you are getting tired of a slow connection or weak connectivity, get this thing and watch shows as they were meant to be watched. I didn’t even realize I was living in squalor.

  My Roku is 6-7 months old and I have had nothing but issues with the remote for the last 3 months or so. Bought this product at the end of June, 2018. It worked great for the first 3 or 4 months, but after that the remote started having issues. At first it was easy to repair the remote and it stayed paired for a decent amount of time. Lately the remote constantly disconnects and does not always repair with the device. I have tried every troubleshooting tip suggested by Roku including the free HDMI extension cable and nothing has worked permanently. I sent an email to Roku support and am currently waiting to hear back. Hopefully they will be able to resolve my issue. Will update if issue can be resolved

  I have an older LCD tv that I lost the remote to, but was saved by Roku.  Once connected, the Roku remote works to control the volume and power on the tv.  Plus the Roku stick is fully contained on the back of the TV, simply plug it into the HDMI port, then plug the power into one of the USB ports, and you're all set.  Follow the on-screen prompts to connect to your wireless network, and you're all set!

It's simple.  It plugs into and HDMI and power source and you're good to go once you've hooked it up to Wi-Fi.  I have two of these devices, and I'd buy more if I needed them.

The assistance was being told that I needed to pay a fee of 89.99 for 5 years. It was something new. I argued because no where does it state any additional fees. They said as of Sept 10th my regular roku tv’s wouldn’t of worked anymore either if I didn’t pay this fee. I asked to speak with a supervisor. I was basically told the same thing. So I asked to speak to HIS supervisor. I was told due to the high call volume his supervisor would return my call in 30 minutes. It’s over an hour and a half later. No call. My roku TV’s are no longer working which they were BEFORE this phone call. Neither is my log in info so I can’t edit anything. I have searched and searched to try to find a way to contact roku. I was finally able to get on hold with their technical help. My time is climbing. I have been on hold for 30:58 and it was at a 38 minute wait when I first called it’s now at 44 minutes. What a bad business venture. Seems to me to be false advertisement. No mention of other fees. They state it isn’t an activation fee it’s a registration fee for the account but you can’t use the product without doing so. Don’t waste your time.

  This is remarkably easy to set up and to use. Streaming quality is excellent. Remote hooked up to my TV in just a few seconds. I have not tried the Voice Control, as I have an aversion to our future Robot Overlords.  This is as easy to use as a Firestick (which I also have) but as the Roku also allows you to access Amazon Prime through it, I find myself using the Firestick less and less.

  I don’t like the fact that I have to unplug the thing and plug it back in when I want to watch the fire stick. It doesn’t have a power button and I have pressed every button or combination of buttons to turn it on. Please respond to this.

  The firestick lite is a really great option, if you don't care too much about having multiple remotes (which we don't, so it's a win for us). This little gadget turns any tv with an HDMI port into a smart tv and we are really pleased with it so far. We haven't had any issues streaming content or loading our preferred apps. Navigating the apps is a little different than if you were to use them on a smart tv, but nothing is difficult about it at all. Very pleased.

  After the latest update the home screen resembles a billboard and you cant even download youtube ""for your convience"". without putting in a home address. when i first used the device this was not the case. if you dont want a future where you need to scan your government id to use the internet, you should reject devices like these.

  I hate the new home screen. I have an older fire stick without Alexa, and it's much easier to find my apps, purchased content, and what I was just watching. The Alexa voice control works ok, but doesn't always find what I'm searching for. I find it easier to spell out the selection in the search category. I guess if you're a poor speller, Alexa might be helpful, but I wish I had the option to change the home screen back to work like the first gen. fire stick.

  This was a good product at first but it has been terrible for the last 4-6 weeks, very much making me regret spending the $50  on this and not on the fire stick (which i already have one and just bought a second one because this has been a piece of crap lately). It is always giving issues saying it can't connect to the internet, then I got to settings, check it and there is an excellent connection. Also stops playing in the middle of shows so I have to get up and unplug it then plug it back in to get it to work, which it only does for a short time then I have to do that again.Just buy the Amazon Fire stick and save yourself some time.I'd also like to say that I did my research before buying this and thought it was the better buy for certain features, but not worth it when the other stick does everything exactly the same.

  Product does not work well. The app for the remote operation does not work correctly either. The customer service is poor. The system tries to force you to put in your credit card information, when it should be just allowing you to setup your account. After a month or so the tech support will let you know that you don't need it. Most things require another account to access.

  the devise is easy to install. the remote is a nightmare to get it to work. The signal doesn't get to the tv so I spent too much time pressing the channels really hard and it still doesn't get the signal well. The app works but it has commercials and you have to look at it as you change. Is not like the physical remote that you feel the buttons and don't have to look down to change the tv. do something with the remote, otherwise it could be good.UPDATE: 10/1/2019 I called Amazon they comunícate it with Roku  and they will be sending a new remote.

  my first roku since the first-gen ""box"" way back when, which i ditched when i switched to a smart tv.  however, the smart tv in question (an LG) keeps phasing out support for the apps i use, and the interfaces are abysmal.bought this for xmas and haven't looked back.  UI is straightforward and intuitive.  has apps for everything i stream - amazon, netflix, cbs, cw, etc etc etc.  setup couldn't be simpler - plug it in, connect it to wireless.  only downside: no way to assign a static IP address, so if you generally do that (or if your router is twitchy about dynamic assignments) you're SOL.solid A.  would buy again.

  Love Roku.  This device works great and can't believe for it's size what it can do.  For those looking for a mute button beware that the exact model number has not changed between the one shipped with a mute button and one shipped without the button.  Mine ordered on November 24,2019 was shipped without a mute button.  The item was clearly advertised with a mute button.  Now to be fair Amazon support did provide a resolution for my trouble.  So be prepared to possible receive the wrong item as presumably they clear out old inventory.

  I got this to replace my glitchy Fire stick, and so far, it’s been great. I’ve had no buffering issues or any other issues with streaming content loading. My only complaint is that the volume controls on the Roku remote can’t be paired with any sound bars other than ones made by Roku. There are better sound bars available for the money than the Roku ones, so this was disappointing since I was looking for the simplicity of one remote for everything.

  When you get it & call the number provided to set it up you are led down a rat hole, where the people at the other end claim you have to pay an extra amount for a subscription to a service in order to get programming. They get your credit card # and charge $112.99 for a ""Roku Premium lifetime"" service. If you don't pay, you get to sign in, but only as a limited time ""Guest"".  You're not *supposed* to have to pay anything extra for Roku... this is a misrepresentation at the minimum, if not a scam.

  I needed to Roku for my upstairs bedroom because that flat screen wasn't a smart TV.

It's very user friendly and I was able to get all of the aps that I wanted.

  We bought several of these so we can stop paying xfinity to rent their cable boxes.  They've all been great, but one of the remotes in my last order doesn't work.  It controls the Roku, but we specifically bought the version that would also control the TV and in settings, Roku says that the remote is not configured to control a TV (even though it was in the same box that our other Roku was and that it has the same volume buttons on the side of the remote).  The Roku works just fine, but the remote is super disappointing since it does not control our TV.

  We cut our cable a few years ago and invested in a Vizio smart tv.  We watch all our shows on Netflix and Hulu.  However, the tv network ""The CW"" was taken off of Hulu so we then had to download the cw app on our phone and plug it directly to the tv in order to watch our shows on that network (The vizio smart tv doesn't have an app store.  You just get what you get...).  This got really old!  We have friends who have Rokus so I decided to do some more research.  They happened to be on sale at the time and I also had an amazon gift card so we decided to make the purchase.  We are sooooo glad we did.  No more plugging our phones into the tv and there is also a great selection of all kinds of other tv shows and movies.  This is absolutely worth the purchase.  The reason why I got this specific model over one of the cheaper ones is because of some of the specs.  Faster wifi connection, voice control, better remote, etc.  These admittedly are kinda nit-picky and unnecessary but I like my tech so I went for it.  I would encourage you to compare the specs of the different models and if those upgrades don't matter to you then go ahead and get one of the cheaper ones.  Make the purchase, you'll be happy you did!

  and the reason is that the stick is too long to use in any of the HDMI connections on any of 4 TV's I tried out.... Well, you can get a cable to resolve this for free from roku. But you have to go on their homepage and apply for it. So they get all your data, phone number, email and so on...Sorry roku, but that's a bunch of BS. So I have not tried it if it works , as I am waiting for my adapter cable, one I purchased from Amazon.

  I would give this piece of junk negative 15 stars if I could. One month in the remote completely stopped working. I cannot use the app as it consistently says the device is not on the network even though every other thing streams movies and shows just fine, including the smart TV that it is plugged into. The worst part is, I fought with their horrible customer service to get a replacement remote and they have been telling me for weeks now they are out of them. The frustration is unreal.

  Do you want to start streaming an internet TV service like YouTube TV? Then you can't really go wrong with this Roku Streaming Stick+.  I use Xbox One, Google Chromecast and Apple TV to stream YouTube TV and have found that the Roku handles it the best, plus gives us additional channel options, including Netflix and Hulu (separate subscription required). The interface is smooth and responsive and I have not had any issues with watching content.  I highly recommend this.  The other nice thing about this Streaming Stick+ is that it is small enough to slip into a backpack or bag to take along when you travel.  Since it plugs into an HDMI slot, most TVs you'll encounter can be used to watch what you want (or what you want to keep your kids entertained while you do something else).

  This Roku is useless. I have owned Roku units since their first model. This garbage stick refuses to even boot up the first time. I will connect then I connect from my WiFi. I plug a 4 year old unit from another room into the same HDMI slot and it works perfectly. The speed test on my phone in the exact position the stick would be is 46 GPS.

  I highly recommend the Firestick light. I was aware that the remote did not come with the power button, or volume control, for the tv. I am one of those people that did not mind. I have the remote for the tv, so there really wasn’t a need. It’s just a nice little extra. So, if you are like me, you will be highly satisfied!  If you are not like me, I’d go with the regular - not the Firestick light. The Light is the way to go, especially if you are on a tight budget . I received fast shipping to make everything that much better. Thank you!

  It started out good. Now every other day it needs a hard reset or it does not have sound. I went to this from the 1st Gen fire TV which was a box. I wish I had just spent the extra money for something different.

  Came in a day, put batteries in and set it  up quickly in place of my Living room Fire stick.  I downloaded the  data off of my wife's account and it loaded her saved settings. Once completed I took it to the bedroom  and plugged it into our second TV and it works flawlessly.

  The roku + works great, with prime and netflix and all the other free stuff we no longer need cable. Only problem I have encountered is from time to time it does over heat even with and extender plugged into it.

  I have never before used a Streaming stick. I had read several Technical reviews online before choosing this one because it had a great assortment of reviews. I am so glad that I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick+, it was so easy to get it set up and super easy to use. I was so pleased with it that I purchased a second one for my bedroom. I was happy to cut my cable off, and this product helped to make it so worth it!

  Any Roku device pays for itself against the cost of cable subscription. It's always very easy to use. My favorite features are these:1) The ""Plus"" versions of these devices allow you to control your TV power and volume so that you can have a ""one remote"" experience which is easier for both you and especially for guests.2) Even without the headphone jack of the Roku Ultra, I enjoy the ""private listening"" mode by using the smartphone app and connecting my headphones to my phone.

  Within a  few hours of use I got “your device is overheating” message appear. This isn’t something one would expect, but after a search, it seems to be fairly common Roku stick issue. Device was almost too hot to touch. Very dangerous! I had to unplug and let it cool down.

  Got it to stream xfinity so I could get rid of my box. With Comcast u must have at least one box and any other room in your house you can use one of these sticks and download xfinity the app. You can’t order movies with Comcast on demand app but that’s the only thing it’s missing which is fine bc you can just order movies with other apps like vudu etc. I bought a roku years ago and threw it to the side bc it wouldnt update. I bought this and after I saw how great it was I plugged in my old roku and it updated as well so they really came a long way with updates I’m impressed. Just make sure you have the stick plugged in to your faster USB port(tv may have a couple) Mine is plugged into my (HDD) 5V 1A port. I plugged it into the slower one (5V 0.5A) and it showed a message it was overheating. Since changing the ports I never saw that issue again. Yay!

  I have 4 cable boxes that charter was charging me $8/month for each box.  With this Roku stick, which sets up in about 10 minutes, I am saving $24/month.  If you did the math it does not add up because charter says that if I have their cable package I have to have at lease one box.  During setup I added spectrum tv and now I have all of the channels I had before.  These Roku sticks will pay for themselves in about six months.

  Everything about the stick itself is great. Easy install, great implementation of 4K, easy navigation. Why only 4 stars? The less than stellar remote. Putting the volume/mute buttons on the right side, not top, of the remote right where your fingers are holding it was a bad idea and needs to be rethought. I often accidentally mess up the sound simply by holding it in my right hand.

  Just cut the cord with our cable company and needed a streaming device for our ""dumb"" TV. I've been using a Roku on another TV for a while and I like the interface better than the fire stick. But having to use 2 remotes was a pain. This solves that issue with the TV power/volume buttons. It was very easy and quick to set up and link to the TV. Works great - I am very satisfied. Just one nit pick would be that the mute button is located in a spot where I frequently push it by accident.

  The unit works fine. It goes through a restart process every time you turn on the tv which takes time, unlike the older model. Upside is that you can turn your tv on / off with the roku remote. The voice control is handy and works most of the time. The remote sucks battery life like an energizer succubus. We use name brand batteries and it eats them like candy which is BS.

  We have a clunky old BlueRay system that also has internet access for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.  It has always been glitchy - especially with Hulu, and then it stopped supporting Hulu (not that I cared too much).  My wife has been advocating for a Roku for months, and I finally decided to go acquiesce to her request as a holiday / birthday present.  Little did I know that the present would be mine.  This is so easy to install, so fluid in operation, so simple to use that we don't even use any of our other remotes any more.  We love it.  So, I hate to admit it, but my wife was right - my only regret is that we didn't switch to Roku sooner.

  The stick is fine, the problem is the remote,  the batteries die quickly. Google the roku remote problem, and you'll see I'm not the only one with this problem, called roku, they'll change it, new ones arrive in a month, none it stock.

  I took a star off for streaming because some things have a little more difficulty streaming but that could be my internet are the streaming service itself not the device. You may not have that problem. This is much easier to use and faster than my old Roku. I use this with my phone's mobile hotspot. It also communicates back and forth with your phone really easily and instantly

  This is one of the fastest installs I have done. It took me more time to get the Roku stick inserted in the HDMI slot behind the TV due to the wall mount space restriction. Do note, this requires a power source, so do ensure a power strip or outlet is nearby as the cord is a few feet long not very long (understandably); the other option to charge it via a USB slot on the TV; which worked well in my case.Once installed, the interface finds your Internet connection and connects to it (pwd. required of course).Will be buying another for other rooms.

  The Roku Streaming Stick + is an excellent product in every way! Set up was simple and fast. Within ten minutes of receiving it I was accessing all of my accounts  (Netflix, Hulu, Prime) and tons more! I am not the most tech savvy person and it was simple for me to use and a lot smoother running than previous Roku products that I have purchased. After reading reviews I ordered this and am not in the least bit disappointed! We ditched our satellite television service a few years ago, raised an excellent antenna (also from Amazon) and started streaming video instead. This purchase will definitely enhance your entertainment options.

  After years of being at the mercy of monopolistic cable companies which provided mediocre service for very high prices, I have jumped ship. Made no difference where i lived, each place had one cable company that ruled --- and while some were better than others, none really bothered to provide top notch service. They didn't have to! My ROKU is great --- I get all the TV I had before with cable, plus MANY more options, for less than half the price even with the extra options stacked up for super premium service. What a breakthrough! Waaay LESS than half the price PLUS really really good service and waaaay  more of it!

  I love Roku!  This is my second one. My first one lasted almost 10 years!  Then the remote died. That is an awesome lifespan for technology, IMO.Roku is completely awesome. The screens are intuitive, it’s one remote for my tv and sound bar and the Roku. It has quick buttons for Netflix and Hulu. It remembers where you are in a show when you pause and you can come right back to that spot at another time.My wifi is about 600’ away on another floor and the streaming is uninterrupted.Fabulous. Don’t buy anything else (ie the Amazon Fire stuff - my friend has it and it is terrible). Buy this!!

  So glad I choose this set over the other less expensive ones. Bot until I received it did I realize it could even control the volume of my TV. The only negative is the remote is very sensitive. The volume more sensitive than the other buttons. The home button even changes my HDMi for me.Love it and use it instead of streaming directly from my TV due to it is just easier.

  I was a loyal Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra user for a number of years but frequently had problems connecting to it from my laptop. The Roku is absolute dream: setup is easy, the remote is simple yet effective, and the UI is **incredibly** responsive. After having using Netflix apps in countless hotel rooms that were slow and laggy, the incredible speed of the Roku UI is like mana from heaven. Great channel selection and also works effortlessly with my Plex server. I now have one in the living room and one in the bedroom - I love this device!

  It constantly reboots itself and we have to sign back into everything.  Does not have enough memory to store seemingly any apps.  Roku Customer Service (which I would give zero stars to) says it is because the tv does not have enough power and it needs to be plugged into the wall (I have tried it on both of my relatively new Sony TVs).  That would defeat the whole purpose of having a streaming stick.  I have several other Roku products which are fine but this streaming stick is completely terrible and you should definitely not bother with it.

  Bought this to replace an old Chromecast I had. One of the best purchases I’ve made in recent years. The connectivity and response is superb. After I purchased I went ahead and upgraded my Netflix plan to the premium Ultra HD and couldn’t be more satisfied. I used to access Netflix and Amazon on my PS4 before but after I purchased the Roku the difference is night and day.

  Great product! The only thing I would change is adding a power button. I have tried to google to see if this remote might have a power button like the home button or something but nope, other than that I’d say don’t lose the actual tv remote 😂 but great for a heads up if you are expecting a power button like the other fire stick!  Works great, voice recognition is 5/5 stars.

  Absolutely useless to watch live tv. All “live “ tv apps are  unavailable. Bought it to work on our older 2015 Samsung tv since sling app won’t work on it. Fire tv  says it’s unavailable. Tried the stick on my 2018 Samsung tv which has the Samsung App Store sling tv installed. Still says unavailable. Deregistered , restored to factory default, logged in using husband’s account. Still live tv unavailable . . Useless junk!

  I was a little nervous that the device only connected wirelessly to the Internet (I thought perhaps an ethernet/wired connection might be better), but I've been mostly happy so far with the quality of the image. It's not quite as high-def as I had hoped, but it looks pretty good. The Roku interface is very easy to work with, and it makes cute sound reminiscent of Nintendo Wii. And because of the USB connection for power, there are no unsightly cables hanging down from the TV.

  This did not work well for me and wasn't able to get help from Roku support except to move the router or the TV. It's 65 feet straight down my hall to the TV and device kept signing me out and pausing to spool up. Not an enjoyable way to watch a program. I gave it 2 stars because it may be my internet, but being to get only stock answers from Ruku was no help. They kept sending me a link to hook up by ethernet cable, but that's not the Roku I have. Communication was a big problem.

  I've actually purchased 3 of these for my house. (big house!) And I'm quite happy with them. I did need to use a wi-fi booster for the Roku in my living room. Big house, brick walls, etc...needed a booster. Nbd. It works fine now. Two of our tv's are newer, so they power the Roku. One tv is a bit older (still a flat panel) but it cannot power the Roku, so it's plugged into the wall for power. Again, nbd. But other might want to know about it.I like the remote. It's lightweight. Buttons are easy to use in the dark. Menu system is not complicated. Easy to install! I am not tech savvy, and I didn't have a hard time with this thing. :)

  We really like this device.  It has a very user friendly interface for navigating the TV stations.  The best part is that it lets us load all our TV streaming subscriptions on it and then be able to use it anywhere we go....in hotels, at friends houses, etc. and it knows exactly where we left off on each series show.  We bought a second one for our downstairs TV as well.

  Well, I should have searched the inter webs about this.  It get super hot while streaming (too hot to touch) and will lock up and be unresponsive after sitting idle for a few hours (even though it has not heated up). I have another streaming stick plus purchased last year that works perfectly.  In face the older one it plugged directly into a Samsung 4K TV while the new one if plugged into a long HDMI cable that goes to my AVR.  Talking of AVR, this stick will not control the AVR.  Come on, Roku - up your game.  And while we are talking about issues - no HBO MAX, boo.Time to look at the ChromeCast with Google TV.

  This worked for me for about a month with my projector before failing and giving me constant HDCP errors. I tried to unplug, restart, reboot, change the resolution to 1080p and 720p, but nothing helped.I have the old Roku which is working fine when I switched it in (although Hulu is now discontinued on that version). This basically means that the updated Roku versions have issues the old ones never did. Frustrating I spent $$ on something thats supposed to be better technology and is now basically junk to me.

Bought Roku, Signed up for Hulu Live TV and keep just internet (60 MBPS) all for around $95/month.FANTASTIC Interface with Roku. Easy Setup and it just works like any streaming stick should. Quality is top notch. Has not buffered once while watching live TV. Beyond happy with my purchase. Id go as far as saying Roku+ gives Apple TV a run for its money! Also all the Apps it supports are great. YouTube, Netflix etc. Destroys the interface my Sony TV has for apps. A+Thank you Roku.

  This is a handy device for streaming on my not-very-smart tv. (my smart tv doesn't include the ability to stream Disney+ or CBS All-Access.)  Because my cable company is not covering the  local CBS station due to contract disputes, I got this to stream live tv.  This didn't work with the Fire stick. The live stream froze almost instantly.  Otherwise, the Fire stick works well.  I am able to see live tv when I access the CBS All-Access through Amazon Prime which my tv does have built in.

  Horrible. Tested with 2 TVs (different brand) and I'm required to unplug it every time for it to turn on, then home screen is unavailable half the time, then once I've chosen a show it will play and there will be no volume. So sometimes turning the TV off and on returns the volume, otherwise I have to repeat the process of unplugging it.Our old firetvstick is awful too, but at least it works 80% of the time.I give up, grabbing a book.

  It doesn’t come with an off or on button nor volume and you have to always keep the adapter connected. Like who wants to be getting up to turn off the tv or on or when you wanna do your make up and if you’re comfortable you have to get up and do it manually. I recommend you get a roku remote instead. I want my money back!!!! Also someone called me from the company and as I was explaining the situation they hung up on me and never called back. I want a refund like asap!!!

  I have purchased two Rokus in the past (over 2 years ago) and have had no issues. Unfortunately, this Roku seems to have some tech issues. The remote would not re- connect with the Roku each time TV was turned off and on. Roku tech support suggested removing the batteries, however the batteries are impossible to remove from this remote.  Purchased a new TV as I thought the old TV was possibly the issue, however once Roku was plugged in, the TV stated ""HDMI port hot."" I could not get this Roku to function and it is brand new. Unfortunately, need to return.

  For some reason, this product didn't want to work by simply using the USB cable.  After a bunch of trouble, I had to plug it directly into an outlet.  That was fun considering the HDMI cable attached directly to the unit is about 10 inches long!  We'll see how it works now.  I also might have to use an HDMI extender.  I found that out when I spoke via chat with someone at Roku.  It's free on the website, which I could not find.  I had to contact Roku.  They sent me an e-mail with the link.  Sigh!

  The device was too long to fit right intonout TV. Called Roku and, after some problems, they sent out an extender, which we received about five days later. So far it works well but we're only giving it 4 stars because, even when powered off with the remote, it still streams. We plugged it into a Wemo and, hopefully, won't get a usage warning from Xfinity next month.

  I have had trouble since day one with streaming in my basement bedroom. It's as far away as you can get from the WiFi router without being outside. (Actually, you get a stronger signal on the front porch... but I digress.) It typically would take me about 90 minutes to watch a 45 minute TV show with all the buffering and stopping and starting. (Some days were better/worse than others.) I ordered this because some reviews said it worked and IT DID! I have had it hooked up since I got it last week and it has not lost the signal once and the picture is crystal clear! I have always loved my Roku and this made the experience that much better. If I could give this 10 stars, I would.

  I don't have much to compare it to--this is the first streaming device I've owned, but it works well and is pretty intuitive to use.  Sometimes there has been a bit of delay in getting new streaming services on board--for instance, it was a few months behind the curve in getting HBO Max--but since it's streaming you can always catch up on any show you really wanted to see.

  I had Xbox one S and it works great, but always sucks with remote and logging in streaming apps take FOREVER... I am so tired of it, saw this Roku with 4k and the price... are so nice, I decided to give it a try. (I used to have 1st generation Roku which I hate it). After install and it was so easy to set up and fast! And also its nice that this remote can take care of tv remote as well, so you don't have to use two remotes! (tv power, volumes). The remote batteries are so amazing it last much longer than the Xbox controller! If you guys want to use Xbox console for streaming, you'll be more than happy to have this better than Xbox! --- Time to sell Xbox! :)

  I bought this Roku + streaming stick and did not realize that I would be getting a refurbished one (it has a sticker saying “refurbished“ right on the stick). Since day one we have had issues with it staying connected to the WiFi and finding the signal. We have 6 TVs - 2 of which are in rooms right next to this one - all of which have Roku sticks and no issues with connection. Do not buy a refurbished Roku unless you’re looking for a bunch of headaches and dropped shows.

  My husband and I waited a long time to get a Firestick, thinking we wouldn't use it.  Not the case..we really like some of the  sites, and are having fun exploring the contents.  Definitely recommend this!!

  I have a number of Roku devices and TVs with it built-in, so it was an easy choice to add a Roku stick to my workout TV. It worked fine initially, but due to the recent struggles with services like HBOmax and Peacock I lost faith that the Roku will support current and future services. I replaced it with an Android device (Tivo Stream 4k) - it's slightly less intuitive at first, but supports every service under the sun as far as I know. No more Rokus for me.

  I'm sure this is a good product, but be warned that you can not view HBO Max thru this devise. I have an HBO account thru my cable TV provider and I have HBO MAX at no additional cost on my Iphone. I purchased the Fire Stick in order to view HBO MAX on my TV. Unfortunately, Amazon informed me that I must purchase HBO thru them and also purchase Amazon Prime. I returned the Fire Stick and purchase Google Chromecast which allows me to cast HBO MAX onto my TV without any additional cost.

  This product was very easy to use. Even for the older people like me it was simple to install, must follow the onscreen directions. You must use the volume controls on your tv remote. The voice control with alexa is easy.

  It’s easy to set up. I’ve had a Roku before and in comparison I was disappointed that this remote did not come with the option to control the volume or a power button for the TV. So in the end I prefer Roku more just because it’s more convenient to have one remote for everything.

  I gave it to an elderly friend. After I set it up he found it simple to use. He is pretty set in his ways, so the lack of TV controls worked out well as he insisted that he would continue to use the cable box's universal remote for everything other than choosing something to watch via the Fire Stick Lite. He had initially been concerned that he would have to learn a new remote. He loves it.

  This is my third roku. I have absolutely loved every one other than this one. The biggest complaint is that the remote won't sync about half the time. I have to power cycle the stick to get it to work with the remote. Controlling it with your phone always works though. I'd recommend just going for the box. I fully regret buying the stick.Update: the batteries in my remote go out in two weeks. That's the last straw for me, and this is definitely my last roku stick*.

  Installed on a decade-old Sony ""smart"" TV, which had long-since stopped receiving firmware updates.  Not quite enough power from the Sony USB port, so I used the included power adapter.  Works great on 2G and 5G wireless; only a minor drop in signal strength from the latter, despite being relatively distant from the router.  No apparent latency from the remote; the response is instant.  Best performance, by far, from Netflix, Pandora, YouTube etc. compared to other streaming devices in my home.  Voice commands work as advertised.  Overall, this device exceeded my expectations.

  We've had other Roku's in the past and have loved them.  They're simple to use and set up and I like the interface so I decided to order the 4k version without hesitation. Turns out I should have read the reviews first. I noticed within the first few hours that the remote simply will not stay paired. This is insanely frustrating. You need to restart the device, pull the batteries out and sync the remote again. The remote would then work for a bit and then quit again. After about 4 days of doing this I got so fed up I ordered the Fire 4k stick and returned the Roku. The fire stick has been working well with no issues. I just wish it had the TV guide update for Hulu live like the Roku did.Side note, I was able to return the device to Kohl's. Super slick. Got my credit within minutes.

  I can't believe I waited so long to try this. I am super impressed.  I am about to return all boxes to my cable provider and CUT THE CORD.  This was super easy to set up.  I love the voice functionality on the remote.  This has given me flexibility  to place televisions in areas of my home that did not have cable wiring including my sweetie's man cave/shed.  This allows flexibility to set up multiple televisions in my entertainment area just like in a sports bar.  And, I can take it with me when we go to the beach house, etc.  Again, I'm super impressed.

  I have tried to use it in my garage & haven’t accomplished anything but frustration. My fire stick works just fine in there. I do not have too many devices hooked up & have a booster device which works great. I just acknowledged that Roku is the only device that won’t work in there so far. Yes I tried all of the old tricks like resetting the device, router, etc. Nothing. O well.

  Pros:It is step up from the previous model. I do not need TV’s remote to control volume any more!I use it for Netflix and Youtube only, full HD mode.Wireless connection is good, the distance to the router(tp-link ac3200) is 6 meters including a wall.The picture is as good as it could be on my five years old Samsung plasma TV.No lags. No lags even when I rewind Netflix forward or backward, the rewinding does not affect picture quality.Cons:Volume button is on the right side of the remote control unit which is not convenient.I did not find Roku application for Amazon Prime videos.

  I bought this because my Samsung smart TV had the worst functioning interface in the history of smart TV interfaces.I absolutely love this Roku streaming stick. It's faster all around. It loads faster. Apps load faster with no lag. When I click a button it responds immediately. I had previously read some reviews elsewhere about how the interface wasn't that pretty. I can't speak to what interface that writer was comparing it to, but it is much more pretty than the Samsung smart TV interface. It even has themes to choose from. And again, it just works, and works very well and fast.It also has what seems like hundreds of apps to choose from. Way more than I was able to add on the Samsung smart TV interface.This Roku streaming Stick has made TV pleasurable to watch again. I was so frustrated with the Samsung smart TV UI that I dreaded getting ready to watch a show. I had to make sure to give myself an extra 10-15 minutes before hand so that I could plan on having to disconnect the power from the TV and wait five to ten more minutes before I could ever get a show loaded.Well it may seem dramatic, the Roku streaming Stick has changed my life for the better.

  This is a fantastic product if you don't have cable and want to access all your movie apps. The only complaint I have is the pre-labeled buttons for movie apps on the remote. I wish I could customize which apps launch when I press those buttons because I always accidentally click Sling or Vue but don't have any plans of subscribing. I also went online to request an HDMI extender because all the ports on my TV wouldn't fit the Roku stick; however, each time I requested one the website said they were unavailable and to check back later (no luck there). I finally caved and bought one at the store

  I had previously bought the original FireStick Tv (with TV controls). Since i liked that one a lot, i went ahead and bought two Lite versions on the last Black Friday. I have to say they are a complete dissapointment. The interface is overall slower than the original, it looses  internet connection over and over again (it is not a network issue, since the original FireStick works fine). and the overall experience is a lot poorer than the standar version. I would reccomend to just spend a bit more and buy the original, or buy a Roku.  This one sucks

  Every time I turn on the Fire stick I need to do a hard reset in order to hear any sound. This is both time consuming and frustrating.

I had better things to do on Christmas Eve than take that phone call so I’m still resetting the fire stick with every use and still disappointed in this product

  This one doesn’t control the volume.  However, one thing we have noticed upon installing that sometimes we have to restart the program or movie at the Home Screen to get the volume to come on.

  The round button is a pain. ROKU is easier to use and your fingers don't slip off the disk. I also find the roundness of the remote and it's being very thin forces you to hold it with 2 hands since it slips.

  I've been streaming since the first Roku came out in 2008. I have two old gen Roku XD's, 1 Firestick, 3 Chromecasts one which is the old generation and two new gen. The Roku Streaming Stick + is by far the best and for several good reasons. 1: Faster processor 2. An advanced wireless antenna built into the stick extension (specs says cable of receiving Wifi signal 4x further so helps if your router is further away from the TV or if you live in an area with neighbors WiFi using the same Wifi channels this could make a big difference in your reception. 3. 4K vivid but blazingly fast display seems sharper on older Sony LCD. HDR playback. 4. Also includes a TV control remote which can control volume. I love that I can control the TV volume. Channels pop up almost instantly. I love my Firestick and you can't beat Chromecast if you use Youtube TV but this is the best all around streamer I've tried yet!

  After talking to my son and viewing lots of You Tube videos my wife & I settled on the Roku Plus streaming stick, I was amazed at the install I've been known to go crazy trying to get things set up on our  Vizio TV, within 5 min. set up was complete. Roku Plus walked me through it made me look like an expert. This Roku Plus has channels that will satisfy even the most discriminating viewer, I admit I've never owned a streaming stick. Its awesome so tiny you can't see it the remote is so easy to use & understand.  The best part is when I end up replacing the TV the Roku Plus is easily removed so I can use it on the new TV. You owe it to yourself to get one... Make your TV experience great again!!

  This product was the fourth ROKU I've owned.  I like the UI and it is generally my preferred steaming platform.  I bought this streaming stick at the end of November 2019.  It worked great for about 2 months.  Then I started having an issue when I switched HDMI inputs and came back to the ROKU the screen was blurry and it would not function.  The only way to fix it was to power cycle it.  I lived with that problem for a couple of months.  Then the remote stopped controlling the TV.  Now it will not function no matter how many times I power cycle it.  In not even six months of use, it's garbage.  I checked the website and they only warranty them for 30 days.  I would be cautious about buying this model.

  My friend got this smart TV that stopped working correctly the second it connected to the network - the smart part stopped working leaving her with a dumb tv that was incredibly hard to use. The Roku stick is a perfect fix for this since it was made to boot up with the TV, when connected to the TV for power. This means the second she turns the tv on, the Roku automatically boots and displays on the HDMI port I plugged it into. In addition, I like the Roku interface. The remote makes sense,  different streaming services show up as different tiles, and the remote has useful HOME and BACK buttons to get back to the selection screen.

  I've had multiple TiVo devices, and I still have an earlier Apple TV, an Amazon Firestick, two SmartTVs, and now 3 Rokus.  I doubt I will get anything but Roku from now on - it's just good, cheap, and easy.  Yeah, there are corner-cases where other devices come in handy:  Firestick supports Alexa, Apple TV supports Airplay.  But if you mainly care about streaming, nothing beats Roku.  It is to streaming TV what the iPhone is to the mobile phone ecosystem.

  We bought this on a recommendation and it may be the worst purchase I have ever made. Perhaps my home has too much interference but it continually drops the internet connection. It is unuseable. It is set up correctly and every couple of days we may be ale to watch a show. It finds my network fine and indicates a full strength signal but still says it can't connect. Sometimes, when I re-enter the internet password it will connect for a short period then drops again. As in the title, it is totally useless. i have ordered another streaming device to replace it.

Slow and virtually unusable.And YouTubeTv includes full DVR capability - record and replay anything at any time!  On any device!!!I'll cancel my cable subscriptions very soon - !!!  AT LAST!!!

  When it finally turns on, it functions fine.  The problem is the light indicating ""ON"" does not turn on immediately. Conversely,  the light indicating ""OFF"" stays on for a long time.  Very frustrating.  Is instant-on and instant-off not a feature of this product?And furthermore, good luck trying to find any Customer Support contact information on their website!!  You have to dig deep to find an email address and if you're lucky they might get back to you.  Why do they hide behind their internet screen?  To screen the in-coming complaints?  Not a good idea.  Why is there no phone number listed for easy problem resolution?!I WISH I HAD PURCHASED SOMETHING ELSE.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH ROKU!

  The Roku Streaming Stick+ was amazingly easy to install.  I had worried that its placement in an HDMI port on the back of my tv would make the remote awkward to use - no such thing.  It works flawlessly. I had also wondered how to program the remote so I could power on/off my tv and adjust its volume.  That was a seamless process - it asked me if I could hear music, I said yes, and it was done.  The streaming quality is outstanding and it is very quick, no blips.  I’ve used Roku for years on multiple TVs, and this one is the best one yet.

  Just got my roku and so far I love it. I am primarily a google/android user so at first I was considering the android TV but decided to get a roku instead as Google isn't really working on android TV anymore and it hasn't had an update in a while. First off I like the fact that roku is an independent company that support both google and amazon. It also has many channels to chose from. There are plenty of free as well as subscription channels. Some of which are international like Viki. The interface is simple and easy to navigate. The remote has the ability to power on my tv and control the volume which I love.

  Be Leary of this device. I activated using the phone number included in booklet with device. I was charged $70 streaming fee for 5 years. Today when I was setting up my roku account I discovered it could not be linked without changing my account info and resetting to factory settings. I was told Roku does not charge. Fee. I’m now concerned that a scamming company was able to send info in a product I bought through Amazon.

  This streaming stick + is fantastic.  I purchased one because we needed Roku in order to stream an international channel that is only available with Roku (or screen mirroring to an Apple TV which is a bit more complicated).  Setup was very easy, and everything worked perfectly right out of the box.We only needed the international channel on one TV, but we are cord cutting at the same time.  What I found was that the stream through this Roku was vastly superior to the stream through our TVs app alone, so I ordered a second one.  We use an Apple TV in one room, I find the stream quality to be similar but of course this stick is about 1/3 the cost of the Apple TV.  Very impressed with this Roku device!

  When my Roku is working it's a beauty. Unfortunately that's less than half the time. More than half the time I turn it on and nothing happens becaue the remot got disconnected from the stick. So I start the process of pushing a little button on the stick on the back of the TV, followed by pushing another button on the remote. Even then, it's hit and miss and may not pair and work. Today, the remote lost connection to the stick while we were watching a program making it impossible to pause without restarting the stick and going through the pairing process.

  This product SUCKS, I have two of them. First, they eat batteries all the time, they need to be replaced every 3 or 4 weeks. Tell me what other remote control does that, that's right none do.Now it is glitching all the time. Sometimes it will connect and sometimes it won't. It has a mind of its own.I don't know how this company is in business when they can not make a streaming device that works.

  This is the 2nd 2020 Streaming Stick + I have had to return for an intermittent high pitch squeal. I've tried multiple hdmi inputs on my 4k Samsung with no change. The first stick squealed from the beginning. The 2nd was perfect for 2 weeks, then began to have the same issue. I have no idea what the deal is.  Not only that, both of these sticks - only when used with Prime Video - displayed audio lag. I have searched the web high and low trying to solve these issues. I finally just gave up.

  Get this, we just love it. Not sure how we lived without it...okay j/k but.....Roku expanded our options to the point we don’t miss satellite tv. I have Amazon Prime and that took things even farther. I can binge watch Masterpiece Theater and my husband has ESPN and all the PPV channels so he can watch recent unnecessarily violent movies again. It’s a win-win.

  I like the voice command but was disappointed the mute button was eliminated. I've had to replace the batteries every few days which is annoying. My previous Roku was a much better unit. I should have returned this one as I believe it is defective but it is too late.

  This is a great solution to multiple remotes for streamers who use Roku (best app organizer in the world,). However it badly needs a MUTE button.  Hope their next one includes a mute function.  The other observation is that there’s a considerable lag from when it’s turned on to get to the “home” screen, sometimes it’s unresponsive and I have to go to the back of the tv (where the ‘stick’) is located and press home on the remote to get it to respond.  I have 2 of these, and they’re both the same way.  So kinda buggy, but I’m sure they’ll improve.  Otherwise works wonderfully to control sound and apps.

  The stick works.  It performs as promised, but it will not work until you provide your credit card number first.  After you do that, the upsell requests begin for you to add premium channels...free trials, etc.  Roku asks for demographic information that has nothing to do with the function of the device.  I have no problem with the function of the Roku stick, but its backdoor marketing efforts left me wanting to take it out of the tv and send it back.

  It's on a vizio tv, it gets really hot but there is nothing around it blocking air flow. i've even since put a fan pointed at it but it still gets hot and gets stuck in the screensaver every day.  i use this one in my office and every morning i turn my tv on, have to press the reset button on the roku, wait for it to boot, then i can watch whatever i want.  also despite having an enterprise class wireless system in the house it refuses to roam access points even if it's connected to the WAP on the far side of the house (there is one 5 feet away).  the wired roku premiere + with ethernet works way better

  So far so good other than it arrived with dead batteries for the remote.  At least it works (unlike the fire stick which was a waste of money from day 1!). Changing review to 2 stars.  Remote works for maybe 2 weeks if I’m lucky then I need to replace the batteries.  I’ve owned it now for 5 months and remote it totally corroded and unusable.  I’ve been using expensive batteries and it’s not acceptable.

  A good device...when it works. I have had this device less than 6 months and the remote has died.  I have done all of the troubleshooting on go.roku.com/remotehelp and it is still not working. So now I need to spend another $20 and some change for a new remote. Oh wait, I can’t. It’s backordered because apparently all Roku remotes are terrible. If you are considering Roku, I would suggest looking elsewhere. This is just a terrible product.

  Recently bought two to replace a Roku HD and a Roku 2.Installation was a piece of cake... I didn't even open the quick reference, just followed the instructions as they came on the screen.I love the increased range of this version. Same with the ability to turn on and off the TV and control the volume. Voice control is a bit flaky, not understanding what I was saying. I hope this has adaptive learning to better understand my Kansas accent.I like that it goes right to the start, rather than continuing the same long intro over and over. I've been doing that anyway, but manually (the Roku 2 did the same, but not the XD.Remote is great but I do miss the skip forward, guess there was not enough real estate to have it.Reliability has been perfect. I've read a couple of reviews that said they had hardware problems, but I think is is just specific devices and all of them. Sed it back and get a new one.All in all it's as good as any electronic device I've had in the last few years.

  This is my 6th ROKU purchase.  I'm sure that everyone has a preference when it come to choosing a streaming device.  I've now purchased a ROKU for college kids (now grown and flown), senior parents (90+) and again for kids moving into their ""new"" apartments as a gift.  I've updated mine in order to receive the disney+ channel, etc.  honestly, couldn't be easier, just plug in and use.  Easy to follow prompts to set up. And it great to travel with.

  I have the regular fire stick previously.  My dog chewed up the remote and a replacement remote cost the same as a whole new fire stick.  Luckily I found this Fire stick lite for half the price of a regular fire stick (I bought it during a special sale). It works just as good.  The only difference I've noticed is that you can't control your TV with the remote.  For me though thats not a big deal.  I would recommend it if you're on a budget.

  We love our fire TV devices. One issue that has happened with every single one, though? The remote doesn’t work! I have two current devices that the remote won’t work for. I have to use the app on my smart phone (which doesn’t always work either). So I decided to order a new one for my living room so it would have a remote. Well I got it in and hooked it up, after ONE DAY the remote is already not working again. I don’t understand why they never work, but that’s where we are.

  For some reason the stick is glitchy. It lags to turn on some times. It sometimes doesn’t turn on. I have an older stick and it works better than this newer version. It came formatted in Spanish, which was difficult to reconfigure back to English. I’m sure we got a refurbed crappy one.

  Told Alexa: YouTube Billy Blanks Tae-bo workout. Alexa took me to Amazon music instead. I repeated take me to YouTube  Billy Blanks Yea-bo workout. Finally took me to YouTube but not Billy Blanks Tae-bo workout but to music section. Sometimes Alexa responds correctly but it’s like 60/40 ratio and it’s annoying. The Firestick as a whole is awesome except when I go on Hulu as it plays 15-Sec of a movie and then surges and starts over never getting passed the 15-seconds on the movie. Not sure why. Alexa is 60/40 accurate, the rest works great.

  I have owned a fire stick for two years and have no issues. However the new one with voice recognition works for several minutes than cuts out and restarts on it’s own. This cause me to have to have to find what I was streaming and start all over from the beginning and than fast forward to the point it stopped working. I am in the process of returning it to QVC. Hopefully they will simply replace it. However I will not be able to stream until if and when a replacement arrives.

  It’s was nice and all being able to turn the tv on/off with it. The ease of clicking through the menus was very easy. My main concern is that is uses up batteries in about 2-3 weeks.

Like one floor up and four rooms away. Through cinder blocks away.I love it! I bought Netflix to use it, but honestly I don’t even use Netflix that often, I use the free apps and channels or whatever they are called and watch free tv most of the time.Totally worth it and has been a life saver it. I had antenna and using amazon prime tv for a year before this. Now I use just my prime for buying (although I could access it on here) and my antenna is on my floor.

  I can only give this product 2 starts for the following reasons. I plugged this into my new LG C8 4K TV. While setup was pretty easy I began to notice the following problems over the next month. I am going to be returning this product soon.1. Roku boots up (goes through bouncing Roku screen) and then gets stuck at black screen. I never get the Roku home screen. This becomes more problematic if you turn on the TV and play Xbox. Switching back to HDMI with Roku never gets off black screen.2. Roku home screen hangs frequently. When the Roku reaches the home screen, often the Roku becomes unresponsive. I see that the Roku stick light flashes when I click on remote but the home screen is stuck.3. Left 1/3 side of the screen is lighter than middle or right. I got an OLED TV specifically for the ""true black"" and unfortunately the Roku apps (Netflix, Xfinity, etc.) all have a light ghosting on left 1/3 of screen. I tried plugging it into different HDMI ports but found the same issue. Watching Netflix on the Xbox works just fine with no ghosting.So the Roku stick is most useful for moving between TVs in my home if kids are playing Xbox and I want to watch TV. It has some neat features but just doesn't work well enough to justify keeping it.

  I am Adding to my review because I tried everything and this thing doesn’t work. I should’ve have to triage issues, you guys should just fix the problem by refunding the cost to my account so I can buy a device that will work.This doesn’t even work. Any time I start a show wether on Hulu, Netflix or whatever, it plays to the first commercial, plays the commercial and then starts over again. That happens on every channel. This thing is garbage and I’m very disappointed in this product!

  La versión LITE aunque a primera vista parece un dispositivo muy básico y limitado, realmente es un gadget potente con una agradable interfaz de usuario, y muy intuitivo. Tal vez el apartado de configuración es un poco tedioso por la necesidad de registrarlo en una cuenta de amazon prime video, pero por lo demás, es muy fácil de manejar, y la calidad de audio y video es superior a la de muchos set top box android que existen actualmente.Viene con los implementos justos y necesarios para su funcionamiento y es sencillo de ensamblar.

  Just got this Roku streaming stick with voice control. Was disappointed that the voice control does not work within apps. It’s useless to me. Also I set the remote up and it works to control the sound and turn TV on but will not turn the TV off. Go figure.  It would be nice if it had lighted keys so you can see it in the dark.In my opinion, there are too many steps to take to watch a program within an app. Why can’t you click on the show and it immediately comes on instead of having to click again on “Watch”. It loads slow.

  We're big fans of Roku (and have like 3 in the house), but the streaming stick has been our least favorite product from them yet. I selected the streaming stick specifically because the remote is supposed to be MORE responsive, and the results were the opposite. The remote loses connection frequently - literally every night now - and seemingly at random, forcing us to resort to clunky phone apps to control our TV. And some of these phone apps even have ads. My wife had to watch a 30 second commercial last night just to hit pause on the 'Ted Bundy Tapes.' Why is this a thing?That said, the streaming quality is great, the picture comes in in 4K, and everything else is as advertised. It's much smaller than your typical Roku which is a nice space-saver too. But that remote is a useless piece of garbage that broke immediately and now only works inconsistently.

  Bought this to finally replace my PS3 as our bedroom media center since it stopped supporting stuff like MLB.tv. Working really well so far. Some of the apps(like the aforementioned mlb.tv) are kinda barebones, but others like Plex are very well designed. No issues with streaming. Really digging the remote as well. Being able to use as to control my tv works great so I only have one remote to use and the volume rocker on the side is a nice touch.My one complaint so far is that I wish the remote buttons were either backlit or glow in the dark, since you can't see a thing if the lights are off. Oh and the stick is a wee bit bulky compared to something like a chromecast, but it fits for my tv.

  I bought this because I eliminated cable but kept their internet service in order to use the Roku device. I didn't know that if you don't have cable TV most of the content from many channels on Roku won't be available and you have to pay for whatever material you don't have access to. So cable always finds a way to pull a fast one on you. Other than that I'm overall satisfied with the tons of free material Roku has to offer. Setup was a breeze and the HD is so crisp and runs so smooth that you forget you're even streaming.

  How is it that they haven't fixed the remote battery drain issue yet? Should have believed the forums that there is no fix other than getting a new remote. Also why does it drop connection when switching to an advert while streaming on the Roku channel? Though this doesn't disrupt the show or movie it is annoying. Also weird that streaming through Roku app on an ancient outdated Android tablet is better than the latest stick?????? So after reading multiple forums and trying checks, resets, uninstalls etc no change so bye bye. Anyhow easy return with Amazon thankfully and back to the other streaming stick brand that works.

  Easy way to hook up a TV when wanting to get away from a cable box. Recognizes cable companies without requiring a box. Perfect for a seldom used TV by eliminating a cable box charge. I use them on two downstairs TVs which I only use a few times per month. About $40 each and I eliminated a $12 per month cable box charge for each TV — so about a 3.5 month payback. Not bad. Of course, as soon as we sent the cable boxes back to the cable company for credit, our monthly cable charge immediately went up by about the same amount. Good grief!

  Has upscaled my tv - this is my 5th roku- Best yet!  ***I am updating my review and changing the star rating as this has only worked for 8 months, at which point the picture was distorted. Tried the stick in a different port and it was just the same, it was also very hot. I checked on the warranty which it says is 12 months, but you have to go through their customer service , and the only way I could do that was to register an account with them and give all personal details and have a payment method on file to proceed - I wasn't comfortable doing that. I bought off Amazon so I will talk to them next.

  I was very hesitant to buy The Roku Tv Sticks.  Mostly because I am NO high techie.  Not even close .  So I watched a couple of How to videos on You Tube re: Roku Ultra and Roku Stick.  I have 2 TVs in my home.  I have to say that I am quite pleased with myself as I was able to easily set up and connect both of my TV Devices ( ROku) with ease.  I mean it when I say with EASE.  All you have to do is plug them in to TV and Power and follow the simple instructions on the TV Screen.  I am ready to ditch my cable TV and save a bunch of money.  I only have to pay for my High Speed Internet.  I feel so free :-)

  I bought two Roku’s and two Amazon Sticks. I really like the way the Roku is set up (Menu, volume control and power on/off right on the Roku, etc), but they don’t last long at all. They last about three months...that’s it! The Amazon Sticks last a lot longer.  I hope Amazon comes out with the volume and power button on their remote. They would be totally superior to Roku at that point!  Roku...what a disappointment. 😕

  First...I had to order an extension for the stick.  When it finally arrived and everything was set up, the remote wouldn’t pair. Doesn’t seem to be working. So now I either order a new remote or send everything back. I’m really frustrated!

  We have an LG tv. Great tv. With lots of downloadable apps. However, the tv wasn’t running Disney + well. And other apps started getting sluggish. I thought it was the ISP. But other people recommended the Roku stick.Ordered one. Followed the easy to follow install instructions. Everything is working great. Not glitching or video/audio sync issues that we were having before. The roku made it easy to load all our fav apps, and the stream quality is fantastic. We don’t have to use a bunch of remotes because the roku does it all.Extremely happy with my purchase.

  Love the many channels I have access to now. My only complaint is that it looks for cable channels to add some of the channels to a different tv.

  The Fire TV Stick Lite is inconvenient!! HATE IT!!No on/off button. To turn on or turn off tv you have to pick up remote, hold ""microphone"" button, and tell Alexa what you want. Any verbal commands require holding the the ""microphone"" button. But 'microphone"" button does not work for audio. You must use your tv's remote to control volume and mute.Totally my mistake for not reading the package. Threw the ""Lite"" stick away and bought the Fire TV Stick with the necessary buttons.

  I bought this to use on a tiny tv in our office which is hung on the wall. There was no place to put a traditional Roku box. The stick goes into HDMI port and a small cable runs to the USB to give it power. Apparently my tv couldn’t handle this and a message came up that I needed to use the included plug and plug it into the wall. The roku works perfect, but I took a star off for needing to also plug this into an outlet when it’s made to not have to.

  I love the fact that this thing exists. We’ve been getting literally robbed for decades now by cable and satellite TV providers, and this little sucker finally gives us the freedom to tell them to f@ off once and for all!Simple to set up and use. The remote works good, and it’s literally the size of a thumb drive. No more need for bulky receivers, and messy cables cluttering up the area around your TV. If you don’t already know, you’ll need a wireless internet connection for this.

  So very upset!My entire family are Roku  users. So the main tv roku was several years old and finally was not working well at all.So bought  this one an was hard to do to begin with, I have my little granddaughter and a disabled husband  and live off my paycheck alone and its not enough to even cover bills.So after I bought this we were so happy to have again.We can't afford cable so this is the only entertainment. And 2weeks later it just quits completely. I took and tried on different TV at work, no luck it does not even turn on.I have no funds to package and return.So now we have no TV to watch and are using our cell phones  to watch movies and cartoons for little ones. Don't buy the stick  Stick with the good old cheap Roku much better and will last you many years.

  Initially worked great, but after 45 days my Roku is now dropping connectivity every 15 minutes. Gives message that there's no internet connection but signal is strong on all other devices and speed test is fast. I've performed factory reset but still not working. 30 day return window is up. Should have purchased warranty. Would not recommend this product.

  I just wanted to say, though conceptually this is a great product, I’m absolutely mortified that the usb male to female that goes into the main power plug is a 4ft.This did not give me ample room to actually plug it in, so I had to order one that’s actually long enough right out the box.Simply could have added a single 6 footer standard to mitigate this.Flawed from the start. For the price point this is a huge oversight.

For some reason my Rocky remote wont work with volume and on or off, It stated it couldn’t find my tv and I went through all 53 possibilities. But my LG that’s 3 years old doesn’t seem to have a connection with it. Overall though it streams great!

  I really like the idea of this and it seems to work great.  BUT,  it overheats at least once every couple days.  I have to remove the stick from the tv and let it cool down.  When I remove it,  it is extremely hot!  This seems like a huge fire hazard and an issue waiting to happen.  I've done some research on this issue and there are no real solutions offered. You'd think that Roku would be interested in ensuring this issue is resolved quickly as possible as to avoid any possible lawsuits in the future.

  I've had various Roku models over the past several years.  I bought a new TV recently and wanted the most advanced.  The streaming is flawless and picture is great.  I haven't tried the voice control  - the buttons are easy to use and all I need.  I have a friend who has an Apple TV streaming device.  After he tried my Roku stick he bought one and replaced his Apple which he found too tricky to use.  Price is well worth it.  Only way to go.

  It eats batteries. I have to change batteries in the remote every 2 weeks. It’s ridiculous and super expensive.  I called customer service and they said they are aware of the problem but can’t do anything to fix it. They suggested buying rechargeable batteries. What a pain and expense. Update. Amazon said they were mailing me a new remote. Instead I received a refurbished Firestick. I didn’t even need the Firestick and now they won’t send me a remote unless I pay $100 for it. What a crock.

  Was purchased for me as a birthday gift. Installation and set up pretty straightforward but does require some back-and-forth with codes and security measures so pay attention. Also, in a previous review someone left I read you couldn’t get HBOMax with the Amazon firestick but that is not true. I was able to get it among other platforms like Netflix without any problem.Takes some “tribal” knowledge to figure out all the features. Helps if you know someone who already has it.

  We bought this due to buying a new tv. an LG Smart TV with WebOS. We went from an element Roku TV in our living room to the LG. We don't even use the 'smart' features on the LG anymore due to getting this stick. Roku is far superior to any other OS on a TV so far. It has every app we want or need, plus a lot more, and the picture quality is always crisp and clear. It's so ridiculously easy to set up for first use as well.

  The stick is too ling to fit in the HDMI port on my TV. The ports are on bottom of TV and would normally have enough room but the stand attached to TV (when not wall mounted) gets in the way. Ended up having to give this one to my teenager and using his older box version. 😣

  This works as expected and is easy enough to use. Neither harder or easier than a Samsung smart TV interface.One star deducted because during the mandatory registration it tries to obligate entry of a credit card, though I have no intention of buying something through the unit.

  I am using Playstation Vue as my service. The Roku Streaming Stick + will not fast forward through a recorded program while allowing you to watch the progress. You also cannot watch a show from the beginning while it is being recorded. Maybe it’s an issue with the PlayStation app but it would have been nice to know this prior to my purchase. I checked with PlayStation and there tests netted the same issue on there Roku devices. This is unfortunate because without the ability to monitor the FF progress, you are unable to know when to stop. I can’t believe that I am the first person to notice this issue. I will be returning this devise and replacing it with another Amazon Firestick which works perfectly with PS Vue. One wish is that the Firestick remote provide a TV power and volume feature like the Roku device.

There is a top comment that says that you can only own 2 before you have to pay to register a 3rd device.  I am not sure at all what they are talking about.  This is not true for me at least.  My only thought is that they want to use an app that only allows 2 streams at one time.

  This doesn't support casting and also does not have a functional web browser app. Also can't side load apps. Completely useless when compared to similar products like Amazon Fire Stick or Chromecast. Cannot recommend to anyone who uses anything aside from the basic mainstream streaming apps like Netflix -- even then, no reason to buy this over any other similar product as it also seems considerably slower to run those apps which it does have.

  I've bought a few Rokus and this one is my favorite. It does require a power source (USB or USB to dongle to standard outlet). The power button and volume buttons worked on a few different TVs (Samsung, LG, Vizio, and Panasonic) that I have installed this on. The remote is of high quality. The only thing I don't like is that the remote does work off of 2.4ghz and can interfere with your house/work WiFi signal. I would definitely buy this again!

  We have two other Roku's in other televisions which are working fine.  Since I just cut the cord from ATT, I wasn't sure the standard Roku would do well through our 2nd floor to a bedroom.  This device which has the 4x attenae for wifi built in works well and I am pleased with the signal I'm getting.  Everything started as it is advertised and I connected it to my current Roku account.  Plus I will give a plug for Youtubetv which we pay $40 a month and get many essential channels I want.  I love it since it runs seemlessly since Google/Youtube know what they are doing.

  I had an old tv that had a cable box hooked up to it for me to watch tv, but this Roku changed it into a smart tv.  I was able to get rid of my second xfinity box because of the xfinity app Roku has.  The nice thing is I am able to watch all netflix and all my streaming apps on my old tv now.  I was very close to getting rid of my old tv because it sucks when you can't get all your streaming apps on the tv.

  Great way to cut the cord.  After researching the available options, I chose Roku because it supported YouTube TV which appears to be the best value for streaming services.  It offers only the channels I want at a great price.  Roku takes care of all the other channels/services I need.  I have both a stick and the player.  The player is on my large 4K TV and the quality of the image is great.  The headphone jack in the remote is handy when wanting to watch the TV after my wife goes to bed.  The only improvements I would like to see is the voice control in the remote controlling all the services - now it only controls the ROKU based apps and for some strange reason there is no MUTE button on the remote.

  Roku was my first streaming device and to this day still my favorite. I had the original, then version 3 (could use headphones on the remote) and now this one. The previous two were replaced just because I wanted to, not needing to.I bought 3 of these and they replaced: Roku 3; Amazon Fire Stick; & Amazon Firebox. Why? Quite frankly I prefer the Roku over the Amazon streaming devices. I think they work better, easier to navigate which is vital when you are engaged to someone not so tech savvy.I would have liked them supply a cable/dongle. This device isn't exactly small, and by design of the TV I had to obtain a dongle. My only complaint if you even want to call it that.

  It’s a good product, but it’s awfully wobbly in the “hole“. Doesn’t like to stay in that slot in the back of the TV. And I have never, and I mean never, had a remote drain batteries like it does. Not even a month these batteries are brand new and I’ve already had to replace them. And I haven’t even used it very much. That’s a pain in the assassins.

I have not integrated my Alexa with the Roku yet, as I wanted to get it working so I can cut the cord on cable.

  I've had Chromecast for a couple years and when it came time to upgrade, the reviews for the Chromecast ultra were not exactly lighting my fire. I'd never used Roku before but I liked the fact that it's more ""free range” than a fire stick. I equate the fire stick to an iPhone whereas the Roku is an Android. I've now had it for two whole days and the only thing I keep thinking is, ""why did I wait so long to try this?"" The signal is stronger, the picture is way more clear, and it's much more user friendly. Very happy I switched. I can't wait to actually play around with it to see what it can do.

  This remote is fun to use. I spent my first few hours acquainting myself with this remote mostly playing with the voice search.

  Lo compré en oferta de lanzamiento, una ganga. Aquí en amazon me salió para calificar control de volumen pero yo no he visto esa opción por eso le doy 1 estrella en ese aspecto. Pero de ahí es un gran reproductor.

  Accidentally bought the lite version. Compared to the original fire stick, this one is missing two key features we were looking for: on/off and volume control. This was a late-night purchase and I didn't realize.

  Within a week of having the product,  the volume would go out. I would troubleshoot it, and have to unplug it for about five minutes,  then that would stop working.  This is my fourth firestick I've been sent as a replacement,  and im not waiting to see how long it will take to stop working.

  I love using my Fire Stick to binge watch tv shows that I can’t get the earlier seasons anywhere else! I also take it traveling with me for hotel rooms so I’m not stuck with their boring tv selections.

  We can use our xFinity voice remote to call up Prime Video and Netflix besides regular and premium  channels. I'll give it 5 stars because initially it was fine.  We just didn't need it.

  I am quite impressed how well the Fire stick performs and how many apps/channels/ probrams are available! I would have given 5 stars. However, after using the Fire Stick for only a week, the volume went out for all programs. Luckily, in the help section, it was advised to unplug the power to the Fire Stick for 3 minutes to reset. I did and it works just fine! Just concerned this may reoccur again in the future.

  I can’t believe I haven’t purchased one of these sooner! I’ve been bouncing back and forth from old chromecast and Apple TV models and neither were very user-friendly compared to this. I highly recommend this.

  Bought this to replace another brand streaming stick because it would lose connection several times.  Since installing the Roku, have not once lost the connection.  Very easy to set up.  I especially like that the stick turns the TV on/off and has the volume control (and mute) button on the side.  Don't need to have separate remotes.  Another plus is that the audio is in sync with the video, unlike my previous stick.  Love, love, love the Roku!

  This is our first Roku player.  It's about what we expected.  The only part I find annoying is the power cord, for our wall mounted TVs, it's not the easiest to squeeze the player into the USB then run the power to the outlet.  First world problem I suppose.  The interface is fast, it was easy to setup, and there is lots of trivial free stuff to be found.  No signs of being flaky.  Of course, now the kids all want one for their TV.  Maybe for Christmas!  Overall, we like it so far.

  Works great. Using 5ghz finally. Love the extended range on the wifi. Haven't had a buffer yet since we got it. I wish Roku allowed programmable buttons. Otherwise, every time we get a new device it just gets faster and faster. Not sure what these other people are talking about calling 800 numbers or getting errors. I register my devices online and have never had a problem or had anyone ask for money.

  I thought this was pretty pricey for a streaming stick and small remote, but when I got it and started using it - WOW!  What a difference!  I'd been using the Roku express streaming stick and remote.  I might keep it for travel, but I'm almost tempted to get another Roku Streaming Stick + and giving my express one away.  Very easy setup, streams SO much faster than the standard Roku stick, super responsive, great only needing one remote.  Totally worth the price!  Love it!

  These are great devices,  the bad part is the stupid WiFi based remote control.  What were they thinking.  This thing acts as another WiFi broadcasting device on random channels which can cause interference with the rest of your setup.  Yes I know Bluetooth can mess with WiFi as well,  however the signal levels tend to be much weaker.  Ohh and I have a 6Ghz spectrum analyzer so I can see all this interference.Should you buy one,  yes...they work great.  Stupid WiFi remote issue aside.

  I bought 2 of these at separate times, same models. These are great devices and I am able to take full advantages of their features since I do have Spectrum TV cable and Internet and some international TV packages which are all supported with this ROKU device. In addition, ROKU provides various show apps as well as screen saver like a computer.  I like the speaker feature to allows you to speak the channel app you want to go instead of pushing buttons. This comes handy if you are watching in a dark room. :-)  I have an Apple TV and Chromecast, but I feel that this ROKU device is better out of the 3 devices. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.

  I first bought Amazon Fire Stick. I had problems with it so sent it back and after reading reviews on Roku decided to try it. Loved the ease of use, clarity of pictures, sound and a much better variety of shows. After my first roku, I purchased two more. I m buying another one for a Christmas gift and I m replacing my not smart LG TV with a TCL Roku Tv. I m not real tech savvy and the ease of setting Roku stick up and navigation through the channels has definitely won me over. I m hoping Amazon or someone offers the 2018 TCL Roku 4K TV on sale Black Friday. Then I think my Roku family will be complete.

  I always liked Roku devices, and this is best so far I have used. It provides a great wifi connection, and all input commands are very fast.Also, you only have to use it a few times before the controls become very intuitive. The remote is easy on batteries as well. Like most wifidevices, a good stable and fast signal is imperative if you want the best performance, or you are not doing it justice.Compared to similar products, this is one superior IMO to AppleTV, and other stick devices I have tried.You get a lot of good programming choices with Roku as well.

  This wee media stick is useful and a pleasure to use 85% of the time. The user interface is excellent and the voice recognition works for everyone in the house. Only gripe is that 10% of the time, the streaming continues but the remote becomes nonresponsive and I cannot stop the stream or exit to a menu. Another 5% of the time the startup freezes and I cannot get to a menu. Either way unplugging and replacing the wee stick resolves whatever was stuck and media steaming can resume. But that’s a bit irritating when it happens 15% of the time.

  I have purchased many earlier Roku devices and this one is a winner with me. I have the previous version of Roku Stick and this is a definite upgrade and super easy to set up. The remote is a big improvement. The ability to control volume, power, mute, voice recognition and not have to use another remote is the best! I also enjoy that you have private listening using the app if you want to do late night streaming without disturbing the household.The performance and stream quality are excellent, the best Roku for the money yet!

  Description says it is compatible with any tv with HDMI.  I got this plugged in and started going through the setup process and kept getting an error message saying it was not compatible and it would not let me continue. My TV is a 2016...its not so old that this shouldn't work.  I returned it and bought an Apple 4K which works flawlessly.

  Worked great for the first few weeks. Then would start with the sound ""blinking"" on and off followed by a warning on the screen that the unit was overheating. The unit was in fact very hot to touch. Looking online for troubleshooting and found this item is developing quite a history of overheating problems. I would recommend staying away from this product until Roku comes up with a permanent fix.

  After trying all forms of streaming devices, I always go back to a Roku, I got this stick because in this instance, I got fed up with a sketchy Vizio ""smart"" TV that is rather slow and stupid when it comes to streaming (Advice: never buy a Vizio smart tv, they lag like crazy), I just plugged this in and it turned that slow, useless tv into a fast, reliable streaming TV...

  This streaming stick suddenly stopped powering up (no power light) and since it has been longer than 30 days, Amazon can't help me, they only put me on hold and attempted to contact Roku for trouble shooting help. Finally giving up on being on hold, they gave up promising to call me back tomorrow.. Since Roku warrantees their products for 1 year I thought this would be easy enough to resolve if I contacted them myself. I ended up spending hours on a chat board with Roku repeating over and over again that I tried everything to decipher that it was a device issue. (tried different outlet, different working power cord, hit reset button). After all that, the company will only replace it after I sent it to them (at my cost) to an shipping address I have to wait for in an e-mail that should come to my inbox in the next 1-2 business days. Then I have to wait for them to confirm that it is a hardware issue, then send me a replacement. I live on the east coast and I think they are in CA, so that will take a while. Meanwhile, It was plugged into my kitchen TV and I used it every day for news and such. This is very inconvenient. I could buy a new one and have it the same day but I shouldn't have to!!!

  Easy install and setup, took the TV off the mount to paint put it back up. doesn't work anymore. Very flimsily power connection. My 2.2 connection was on the side of the TV it I just kinda hung there. When it worked it was great too much resetting and unplugging to be reliable.

  If you have a DNS sinkhole on your network, you’d be surprised how much tracking your media devices try to track... While it’s probably expected of Amazon and google devices, and any app you install, I was a little surprised to see Roku doing it too, as I naively figured that they got most of their revenue from device sales. Whelp... nope... they collect and sell data on you like everyone else...If you’re moderately technically-inclined, look into setting up a pi-hole on your network.

  Audio only works on tv. If used on Bluetooth speakers or headphones, the audio is continuously out of sync. I've reinstalled the channels several times as suggested but, the issue persists. Also, I've used two different phones and a tablet so, I know it's the Roku that it's causing the problem.Streaming works fine with Netflix and Youtube, not so much with prime video. Sometimes after rewind, it keeps buffering for a long time or starts playing without sound. Other times, it just crashes.I've tried to screen mirroring my laptop, pretty much useless because of video lag.The volume and power buttons in the controller are useless because the Roku won't recognize my tv.So, probably I'll be returning this device and buying a better one.

  Everything that was needed to get it working was included. The flexible adapter was needed because the FireStick was too thick to plug into the HDMI port on my TV, so I'm glad is was in the kit. It was easy enough to program and get working. It took less than 20 minutes. The onscreen instructions are very easy to follow and the link to Amazon to enable it actually worked (sometimes I have trouble with links). Works well. too.

  I loved the Roku stick but the remote gave out after only a month. I didn't mind because I had the app download on my phone but we recently changed Wifi providers and I can't reset up my roku stick without the remote and the remote on the phone app doesn't work. I don't think I should have to buy a whole new roku stick if I haven't even had this one a year.

  Very dissatisfied. Can't download Youtube and Netflix on Fire TV as they are mysteriously ""Unavailable."" Further, I have a Prime subscription but it keeps telling me to rent or buy movies. Very poor selection for the stuff included in the subscription. Compared to Netflix, this experience is terrible. At least on Netflix, everything is available since you're paying for a subscription. But on Prime Video, you're paying a subscription for nothing.

  Allows me to stream the shows I love. As far as voice recognition, I just couldn't get it to work, but I don't need it. The biggest issue I have is that I have had to unplug the device and then plug it back in way too much, It loses sound a lot and that make me have to reset it, a lot.

  The Roku was easy to set up and works flawlessly so far. The updates were quick and I had no issues connecting to my network. I was agonizing between the Fire Stick and Roku. Ultimately I chose the Roku because I have read it has more entertainment options and a better interface. IDK. I will probably get a Fire Stick down the line to test it. I downloaded the Quick Remote app which is supposed to integrate with Alexa, so far I have not had any luck. Waiting on my Google Home assistant and if it works with that I'll just move my Echo dot into the second bedroom and use that instead.

  I have no problem with the picture, sound and versatility. My problem was the remote control. After a couple of weeks the remote stopped working so I thought the problem was the battery. I changed the battery and it start working again. After a couple of weeks with the new battery the remote stopped working again. Can’t turn off the tv, can’t change the channel or even the volume. The only way to make it work is to open the battery compartment and remove it and put t back. This is a waste of time and not fun at all.

  This is my second purchase of a Roku streaming stick.  The first one lasted 14 months, which was quite a bit less than expected!  I had to keep re-pairing the old one until it finally gave out altogether.  Who knows if it was the remote or the stick itself that failed?

  Got this for Black Friday price (30) on a whim as I already have the Nvidia Shield TV arguably the best streamer out there but also the most expensive. Video quality and audio passthrough is very comparable. The big difference is in the menu and interface lag. The faster processor (and I assume more RAM) of the Nvidia really outpaces the Roku. BUT... actually watching a movie or Amazon Video? You would be hard-pressed to be able to tell them apart. It's a great bargain at $30-$50.

  I've always liked Roku, but with the changes to this one, I love it even more. The voice recognition is a nice touch, and I like the volume controls on the side. It works faster than before too.

  This thing is garbage. The remote has constant problems connecting. Half the time I turn the TV on the remote doesn’t work for a minute, or I have to reconnect the remote to the steaming stick. It’s crap.Get the cheaper Roku with the box. We have that in our other TV and it never has a single problem because you just need to aim the remote in the general direction of the infrared receiver on the Roku.The streaming stick is twice the hassle for twice the price. Not worth it.EDIT: now the damn thing stops working as soon as I get a foot away from the TV.

  I have a Vizio smart TV, and while the picture is AMAZING, the interface for the smart apps sucks. Plus there's no Disney+ or Apple TV. So, I got the Roku Streaming Stick+, and in 10 minutes, I had my channels up and I was watching Hulu with no lagging, like on the TV app. I have one in my living room, one in my bedroom, and I have no worries with either of them. They communicate and I haven't paid an extra penny. Maybe they updated their systems, but I am happy. Also, if you have an older Rokus, Netflix won't work, so you may as well upgrade. This is so much better!

  I like the quality of the image an product in general but right now they are having quality issues with the remote control, you can check in the roku forums or searching “roku remote drain batteries” it eats the batteries of the remote in less than 4 DAYS.

  I bought this December of 2018 for $49.99.  One yr. and one month later (Jan. of 2020) refuses to find a connection always have to pair the remote. The remote always has a 3-4 minute lag from when I press a button to when it actually happens. Now I see they only cost $39.99. Roku support non existent you are stuck using the FAQs on their website. When I go through the remote pairing, pressing reset on the remote, unplugging and re plugging the stick going through the whole set up process then it will work. Turn it off for even a minute and you have the same problems all over again.

  I have a half dozen things I prefer on the Roku to FireTV. Quicker to boot by far, quicker to click the remote from watching something else and be up and in. Better and more configurable GUI. Streams nugs.net where the FireTV cannot. MUCH easier to configure. Some things Not so much as I would prefer to have a preference to hide the side menu until I want to use it. A handful of small things like that. But in general, I'm glad to have both devices.

  The remote seems to disconnect from wifi and takes longer than expected to reconnect. If you're watching a show and don't use the remote for a while and then go to hit pause or select another show there is a serious lag in reconnecting. Finally we've started to notice that sometimes if we hit the back button while watching a show the screen goes black and will not reappear. You can here the roku receiving the controller inputs, but nothing happens on the screen. I end up having to power down my TV and let the roku reset before it will work again. The picture quality for wifi is great though!

  Works great! Very easy to setup and get going right away. Streaming quality is nice. I upgraded from a Roku 3 to this and I’m very happy with it. The added TV controls is soo nice. My only issue with it is it can’t turn the TV and sound bar on/off, only one or the other. The Fire TV stick can do both without issue. If you like Roku I’d say buy this unless you need to have the sound bar control option. One thing to note is it can control the volume and turn sound bar on/off if your tv and sound bar have Hdmi cec support. Just takes a bit more setup. I like the Roku interface better which is why I went with this but I have a fire tv stick and I miss not having the extra control features for tv with sound bar. Overall I’d recommend it!

  Very few quality streaming devices on the market, ROKU has it's quirks but considering the alternative it will have to be my choice until something better comes along.  Be aware purchasing subscriptions using your ROKU device, if something goes wrong with the subscription, ROKU will not refund.  Happened twice to me.  Best to purchase using the app for the subscription if one exists.

  Very easy to set up with our basement TV. It will be used for mainly the nieces & nephews so I didn’t really need the fire stick to have TV controls. Great price! I love my fire sticks!

  Mine is fairly new so it still works smoothly.  After time these can get bogged down.  But so far, so good.  It's much, much faster than a Gen 1 stick, even after that old one has been cleaned up.

  This is nice wished it came in the 4K but whatever I guess, not a whole lot of difference in my opinion. I had a 4K stick and wanted the new looking platform that comes with the light.

  The volume control doesn’t have to be turned up too high. Great sound. The picture quality is great too. Don’t need to make any changes. It’s like being at the movie theater. The remote is easy to use. Just like using ur tv remote.

  So by day two it freezes and gets stuck and won’t load Amazon or Netflix movies. Super disappointed. Tried to replace item, that option isn’t available so I wanted to trade for another type of fire stick but I don’t have the originally packaging so nothing to return it in for a exchange or refund. Other fire sticks work in house , guess this version just isn’t up to par. Kind of pissed.

  This product is so easy to setup and use. We've used several versions over the years and the stick is another great product. By the way, I saw some reviews about people frustrated that roku charges now for activation. This is a scam and it says so in the roku instructions of which I provided a picture. Enjoy!

  My Smart TV is somewhat old, and apps have been dropping like flies (Hulu just disappeared off my TV, and Disney+ and YouTube TV are too new to even be on it).  Roku made it possible for me to watch all my subscriptions AND it loads almost instantly, as opposed to my TV needing a good 3-5 minutes ""loading my settings.""I haven't tried using the voice technology but the app works great to turn your phone into the remote.

  Enjoyed the product for the two weeks that I used it, although the volume had to be adjusted with every program. Then the remote quit working. I contacted Roku and they said they’d send a replacement. It didn’t show up so I contacted them again and they said it was out of stock and they didn’t know when they would have one. No one bothered to notify me. Unfortunately I will have to return the entire device because I have no way to access Hulu.

  Roku seems to work easier and more accurately than the Amazon Firestick. I personally like the way it feels in my hands and the buttons more. I don’t have an Alexa so I can’t attest to that part though. This Roku seems to not have a sleep timer though, like the other ones do. But it literally have everything else I was using before.

  Love Roku! It has HBO Max, Amazon prime, Disney+, Netflix, spectrum TV, Starz and much much more. There is lots of free product to stream. Easy to use and great picture quality. Will recommend to anyone. The remote turned on not on the Roku but also the TV and volume. Roku even tells you when batteries are low. This even beats Fire Stick and Chrome cast.

  I've had a Roku 3 and thought to upgrade it to this Stick+.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the speed and quality of the streaming.  Sometimes, the remote connectivity isn't that great even though I'm only about 7 feet from the TV.

  I bought a new TV and when I finally updated to this stick, boy could I see the difference on picture quality. So, if you have a 4k HD TV, you need to update to a HD ROKU. I've used a ROKU since cutting the cord several years ago.I learned the hard way to use the power cord and adapter for this, don't power it from a USB on the TV, it denigrates from the heat generated off the TV. The power cord pulls it away from the TV and the stick doesn't get hot, and eventually fry, from no air flow and TV heat buildup.My experience w/ROKU customer service as always been good.

  The Roku line of products is great for beginner and intermediate streaming devices. The devices and remotes are simple, easy to use, and are high-quality parts. The UI is quick and easy to navigate. Streaming is good and covers all the major apps available.Top of the line is still the Nvidia Shield TV in my opinion, but that is not needed for secondary TVs. I love the Roku devices for this role and they are much better than FireTV in my opinion. If you are looking for a good streaming device, you can't go wrong with Roku!

  As someone who has never used an Amazon fire stick, I have to say this is pretty great! I was able to set it up with no issues. My apps installed perfectly and I was able to watch it. Sadly my Samsung tv wasn’t supported anymore with many apps for some reason so that’s why I got this. $17.99 isn’t a bad price! I definitely recommend this and look forward to possibly buying another in the near future.

  A rather buggy and iffy product. When is works, it's great.  It frequently does not work. Also, the ability to cast has become increasingly proprietary, meaning that I can cast almost anything to my Google Chromecast, but only select things to the Amazon fire stick. There's room for improvement.

  The box came without the USB cable. Luckily for us we could use a USB cable from our phone. When I called customer service to get a cable they said I would have to send back everything and they would resend another  one. They explained that they couldn't just send me a cable. Guess I'll just continue to use the phone cable cause I don't want to go thru the hassle of setting up another fire stick with all my programs.

  For some reason the sound does not come on automatically when I start the new firestick Lite. I have to unplug it, turn the tv off & on to restart it for sound.

  Immediately after the Firestick app updated last month, the voice action stopped working.

  I bought a fire stick lite for myself, my mom, and my dad for Christmas after receiving the recommendation from a family member. My parents had some difficulty setting up the device on their own, but once we helped them set it up it couldn't be easier to navigate. The fire stick makes it so easy to connect to all of your streaming services and also provides access to TV channels that we wouldn't have otherwise. I highly recommend fire stick lite if you are looking for an easy to navigate, online streaming platform.

  I have  2 other roku's the 3 and sreaming stick. Both are indeed great. Sadly I have had many disapointments with the wifi networking performance of this + stick. That is suppoused to be one of its strongest selling point! I have a netgear ac band system in my house and no other devices have issues with my wifi. This device gets only around a 6mb connection and drops connectivity all together often. It is powered buy the wall plug not the tv and is on the 5g band.

We have tried all the HDMI ports on the TV with the same result perhaps the stick has some kinks and is defective.  Otherwise great product.

  I bought this as a gift for my sister who had a TV Hung that her Cable provider refused to hard wire. With this Roku Streaming Stick+ the provider's app she can get live TV and have access to all the streaming Roku has to offer! I have 2 Roku TV's and have had other Roku devices through the years so I am willing to give them some benefit of the doubt when it comes to the one annoying problem she has regarding the stick. After getting the Roku to recognize her older led tv every time she turns it off it comes back on by itself. I assume it's the tv not Roku's fault but I could not get it to work properly so am not positive.

  Decent, performance could be a little better, start up is a little slow and also lags occasionally.  But after the “warm up” it’s pretty good.  One other annoying thing is why does it occasionally asks you for confirmation after you’ve clicked one of the dedicated app buttons?  For example I click Hulu, then it asks me if I’m sure, click the left arrow to get to YES then click the OK button.  That’s two extra, unnecessary clicks.  Isn’t the point of the dedicated app button to avoid unecessary steps and go straight to the app? It doesn’t do it all the time, just sometimes, which is weird. Interface and remote are easily the best on the market and very easy to use.

  I purchased this because of the enlarged antenna in order to receive the best WiFI  signal from my router. This works and signal strength is very good. I have other ROKU's and have experienced no problems with them.This one, however, is junk. It overheats. It goes nuts and throws a black screen with an error and several steps to correct. The correction does not work for long and the error repeats. In addition the voice if often out of sync with the picture and the picture itself lacks the quality of my FireStick.I contacted ROKU via their website support and discovered the worst customer support I have ever encountered.I am hoping that my device is defective and a replacement will solve the problem but I am getting nowhere with ROKU.So bottom line. My recommendation is not to buy this.If I end up getting a replacement I will update this review with whatever new data I have..

  The Roku device itself works fine, but you must subscribe to a ROKU service to begin to use this... The minimum price for this is $90.00.  This gives you access to several entertainment channels that you are probably already paying for thru your cable company.  This may be a benefit to some users, but I would have preferred to know the terms before trying to install this...

  Cannot get it to work even after contacting customer support. I had purchased this to be able to watch a football game on sat since firestick doesnt have youtube tv. When I hooked it up, I found not get my remote to sync. The lady from customer support told me I needed an HDMI extender. That should not be the case. 1. I tried pairing the remote right next to the Roku stick and if that didnt work, the extender isnt going to work. Secondly,  I needed what I bought to work right when it comes out of the box. Not get it and wait 2 weeks to be able to wait for a part that is not going to work and then still try and wait to figure out what's wrong with it. I'm highly disappointed.

  The RokuTV stick is absolute TRASH. We have had this for less than 30 days and dealt with constant freezing of the actual stick - not an internet problem. Today, it froze so many times that we had to engage the “reset” functions, which makes you set up the stick like “new” which is pretty inconvenient. More inconvenient is the fact that it never got through the entire setup without freezing again. It is now completely unusable. We have 2 amazon fire sticks that we have had longer than this and both work perfectly - no freezing. What’s more - the cost is higher than the superior fire sticks. We only purchased this because it’s the only device Xfinity allows for streaming of their live tv app, but it’s not worth it. We are returning and will never buy another Roku product again. We also hated that there’s no mute button on the remote.

  Bought this Roku because my older tv wasn't supporting any of the streaming apps, and I didn't want to buy a new tv.  It was very easy to set up and it's really easy to use.

  This piece of junk is lucky to play one out of ten videos when streamed from my local hard drive. When using their apps I constantly have to log in, like daily, due to timeouts.

  I am extremely disappointed with Roku's lack of support and knowledge of their product. The reps were rude and treated me like I was an idiot. I spent hours with them, Amazon and Comcast trying to get the Roku connected to my Wi-Fi network. I specifically asked if there were any password restrictions and was told no. We did a replacement drill that took another couple of days with the same results. As a last resort, I changed my Wi-Fi password to a simpler one with no special characters. The Roku connected immediately. Roku support has yet to follow up with the ticket they created 4 days ago. The password requirements should either be addressed as a Roku software issue, or published as a restriction. At the end of the day, I had to change over 20 devices in my home to use the new password (laptops, phones, iPads, cameras, doorbells, thermostats, alarm systems, printers etc.). Now that it is working, I do like the Roku picture and sound. But the effort to get it set up and poor customer support really soured me on the brand.

  Never had a Roku before but I like mine. Easy to use interface, works well with my cable service provider, and has all the different apps I could need. Only problem I've run into is when I'm using YouTube. While watching a video, the app will quit working, and an error message will appear on the screen. Other than that, It's definitely worth the money not to pay for the equipment and go with something like this.

  initially, it didnt work out of the box. was stuck in an initial setup loop (seems to be a known defect from Roku) and Roku Customer service swapped it out no problem.

  I love the fire stick lite. It’s pretty cool. The interface is much different from the fire stick 4K model so it take a couple minutes to get used to.One thing I wish Amazon would do though is to create an app so you can access the fire stick from your mobile device and also if you lose your remote that it’ll give off a signal or create a noise so you can detect it. I love it, it was great and I caught the sale for $20

  I gave old man cable a proper burial and immediately purchased and fell in love with Alexa’s fire stick. We have been together for awhile now and I love how she keeps the relationship alive by constantly making improvements.

  Fire TV Stick Lite Better Value than 4K Stick, Lite stick has better picture than 4K Stick on 4K TV. I like the new menu on the new stick way better than the old menu. Sound is not great & remote is a little cheaper.

  We are Prime Members so we get a more movies than we can watch for free. Lots of free TV inside this fire stick. Tell Alexa to find you a movie and she will bring it right up. We have already canceled our Direct TV that was costing almost $100.00 a month. If you have decent internet service this is a no brainer.

  Okay, I’ve had this fire stick since it came out. It worked great at first but now it’s giving me black out screens, getting stuck on screens, and some apps (especially Hulu) has a really bad problem with getting stuck. It’s just basically not functioning as well as I thought it would. Considering this is my first fire stick to ever own i am honestly not happy with it. It was great at first but now it’s turning into a waste of money. Tired of unplugging and rebooting my fire stick every few days because of this.

  I bought it to replace my outdated RCA mini.  This device is super slow.  I have it right next to the modem and the wifi and it's still always buffering yet, I have 1 GB wifi.  Roku TV in the other room works just fine and Roku stick on the other side of the house works fine.  But this is always crashing, buffering, losing connection.  Since it's 17 for this item.  I will most likely replace it with a Roku stick.

  We bought this to have television at a rental unit we had in Yuma, AZ. We at least had television but finding shows was not easy. Too many point and click options. I'm used to a guide channel for simplicity. Scrolling through all the available apps was a pain. But if you have no television providers then it's nice to have.

  My parents are in their 70s and not technologically adept.  This has been perfect for my mom who has been able to now compulsively binge watch Netflix.  I won't say she has become adept, but on a daily basis she can access Netflix and Hulu and isn't stuck with her crappy cable TV.

  I find the remote to be horrible. It will sometimes get stuck. I find myself pressing it more than once to get to different apps. Also, I am not sure this 4K. I look at my firestick and there is no lag. That is my only negative. The positive side is that it has a lot more channels that are free than any other streaming device. Also you can control the volume and turn off the TV with the same remote. The firestick 4k also has the turn on and turn off using the remove. Also, the volume control work with my TV. I have a Samsung series 6 4K TV

  Even if you already have a smart TV, put a Roku on it anyway.  I haven't met a ""smart"" TV yet that has an interface as good and easy as the folks at Roku have created.  It is also nice that all of my TVs look the same to me since they all have Rokus.I haven't played with voice commands so I can't comment on that.  I have never found a need for them.

  The set up was a breeze.  The picture quality is great.  The remote synched to my TV which is a Samsung Smart TV we purchased in 2012/2013.  I can turn the TV on and off, volume up or down and navigate with ease.  I mainly got this in order to watch Direct TV Now but I can easily access Netflix and and Amazon Video, both apps with which I have subscriptions to.  I also downloaded my News12 app for free which, by the way, was a big reason why I did not want to switch to a streaming stick in the first place because I wasn't sure how I would watch my local news channel (watching about 40 years).  Overall, very pleased.  I have Optimum 200 speed for my WiFi and I have not experienced any buffering.  Love it!!!

  Roku works fine and seems to be the best and most content neutral/friendly streaming device out there.  ""Point anywhere"" remote burns through batteries like I've never seen.  It also takes 30-60 seconds to sync everytime you turn it on.  It's hard to get used to and even harder for toddlers to understand why they have to wait for Blippi when the TV is clearly on.

  I think it was a little misleading that you have to power it with USB. luckily my TV has one but that should be a little more obvious. Setup was easy and I'm excited to have all these streaming options. In an unlucky twist I literally was one day late on the Spectrum TV app being pulled. Hoping they bring that back cause it was the main reason besides the price I went with ROKU

  If your goal is to cut the cord, be aware that many usable apps require a fee - including some over the air programing - such as CBS = all access to name one. Buying a good smart TV gives the user many of the main apps that is needed for viewing pleasure but if you want more ""B"" rated movies and special interests programming ROKU can help, but to be honest YouTube has a good venue. Is it worth it? Yes... if you don't have a smart TV and want to connect to the internet (for YOUTUBE, VUDO etc..) . If you already own a smart TV then it is 50/50... if it is in your budget and it will save money as long the user doesn't subscribe to too many fee based subscriptions.

  I eagerly opened up my package and started setting it up as soon as I got it. It won't power on. I tried several different power sources as well as two different TVs. I contacted roku customer support to try and resolve and was only directed to the troubleshooting page, not even for the issue that I was having, when I asked again clarifying my problem I was again directed to a troubleshooting page that did not help me. Now I've gone and processed a request for a return when all I want is a roku that actually works. Considering how long it took to arrive I don't know if I will be buying another.EDIT: This item was not listed as refurbished anywhere on the listing. I got one that was clearly refurbished (it literally had a sticker that said refurbished)

  I own several Rokus and this is the first time I've had this problem. Roughly half the time I open Roku Streaming Stick it will not connect to my internet. I need to turn it off and on 3-4 times before it will lock on and 1 time I needed to physically disconnect it from TV and reconnect to get it synced to Wifi. Once connected it works flawlessly. The Wifi modem is within 2 feet of Roku and I've checked the Wifi when it does this and the Wifi speed pings at >100Mbps, so I'm baffled.  If I had to re-do order I would buy an earlier version.

  I love my Roku! At first, I was really frustrated while setting it up because it took a lot longer to connect it with my university's WiFi than I expected, but once I managed to figure out what the issue was it went by smoothly. The video quality is great, and goes along with the best my TV picture quality has to offer.My primary motivation for getting the Roku was being able to watch SlingTV without having to use my laptop plugged into my TV via HDMI cord (because PS4s don't have the option of a SlingTV app). I am more than happy with the fact that all of my streaming services are now located in the same place. I highly recommend this product.

  Finally cut the cable!  These were easy to install, easy to connect and are easy to use.  A little bit clunky after having cable for 30 years, but i believe it is the user as opposed to the equipment.  I did not rate for Alexa integration as I have not tried it.  Highly recommend if you are going with another content provider for TV.

  Had it about 2 weeks and already had to go through a lengthy remote re-pairing process which is an enormous pain. Will be returning the roku if it happens again.UPDATE****It happened again. Returned the first unit, got a second unit and had the same issue. Something is wrong with the remote controls for the Roku sticks. The remotes work and then they don't. The remote would still control my TV, but would not talk to the Roku stick anymore, requiring a tedious re-pairing process. I bought another one and returned the first thinking I just got a bad unit. Nope replacement unit had the exact same issue. Check the other reviews, I'm not the only one this has happened to.

  These were easy to set up.  I decided to cut the cord to my expensive satellite and go with a streaming service.  My niece has no problem finding something to watch.  I still have all of the channels I used to watch and can switch between my live tv service to prime or netflix very easy.  I've had to restart them a few times, but no problems so far.  The only complaint I would have is that I wish the fishtank screensaver were the default on the sticks like they are on the more expensive Roku player.

  I have only had the Roku for about five months, and I’m already having issues with it. I tried to contact customer service, but after 30 minutes, absolutely nothing was resolved and they kept sending me to different departments. It was very frustrating, and absolutely nothing was resolved. They told me they would send me contact information to then contact the manufacturer.

  We love the Roku and this Roku stick is our 3rd Roku device in our home. However, we have not even had it for one month and it died. Very disappointing since our others have not had issues and we've had them much longer. After spending time messing around with it I found that power supply box is what died, so if we get a new power cube for it then it will work, but definitely should not have died after less than one month. So, overall, we love Roku, but not sure if their newer ones are made as well since this one didn't last a month.  Would give 5 stars if it lasted longer and we probably just got a lemon.

  The remote doesn't pair at all. The first I time I tried to pair the remote it took me to the page where I would enter my password for the network connection, but it popped back to the let's get started page. I've never gotten past the chose the network page it always goes back to the lets get started page. This is my fourth Roku, I know the pairing process. The main issue is that the Roku will not connect to WiFi. There is no customer service.

  I did my homework before buying this Roku Streaming Stick+.  So, if you've done yours, then you already know why I bought it:  it has higher speed & longer range WiFi than most other models, has up to 4K resolution, has an easy setup, and offers more streaming possibilities than Amazon's Firestick products.  What the Firesticks can do that this cannot is play games, but that was not very important to me.  I also do not like that the Firestick menus are more complicated AND they tend to throw their own Amazon products more prominently rather than other streaming options.  All in all, the Roku line is simpler to use right out of the box and this model has excellent features as above.

  The Roku Streaming Stick+|HD/4K is an excellent product!!! It is so easy to set up even a two year old can do it. This version of the Roku product line comes with the Roku Stick a USB to AC power cable a wireless signal range extender and a Roku remote. It is pre-loaded with app access to either pay to subscribe to services for a nominal fee or you may have access to entirely free app services where you may watch movies and other programs for free. As a sports lover I subscribe to a service that provides me access to sports across all currently existing sports networks.

  Bought this product brand new about a year ago.  For the first few months, five stars - completely reliable, lots of content options, perfect way to ease the family into cutting the cord from standard cable TV service.And then it got flaky.  Random reboots while watching content, frozen screens when powered up, flaky network connection.  Tried multiple reboot/restart/reset strategies and ended up finally getting a RMA and returning the stick to the company (which is a bit of a painstaking process in itself).After a couple of weeks they mailed back a brand new stick.  Which of course worked flawlessly.  For a while.  After another month this one went into an endless cycle of repeating the boot screen (where the Roku letters dance).  Rebooting, resetting, nothing - just the boot screen, over and over.  After a couple weeks of trying resets, unplugging, etc. the device froze up completely and the HDMI input reports no signal.Seriously, the MOST frustrating piece of electronic equipment I've ever owned or dealt with.Roku itself is awesome.  We also have an Ultra box connected to another TV, and just replaced this hideous stick with another Ultra box.  In the same year of ownership our Ultra box has had zero issues.I'm happy to throw this particular streaming stick in the trash and move on from it.

  It's the second time in several years that I bought a Roku. These devices amaze me every time. The WiFi connection is the best I have ever encountered in any device. It connects to my WiFi router (on another floor) when other devices (like the TV) fail. I bought it to play Netflix, VUDU, etc. because my smart TV stopped being smart after two years and now cannot properly connect to those services. The Roku has everything I need and more. I also take it with me when I travel, so that I can hook it up to the Hotel's TV and watch my own movies.What a great company.

  This is our 3rd Roku item in our house and we have had nothing but issues with this stick.  Reset it all the time and finally today it just quick working.  Replaced batteries 3 times - no good.  Replaced it with an old Roku we have in another room and that one works fine.  This 3810X is not worth the box it was shipped in.  Of course can't return it or get any assistance.  Well I think I am moving over to a Firestick.  Time for a change

  I lost my remote for my TV (used the satellite remote for 3 years) and needed to connect to my streaming channels.  I have another Roku in the house so knew the set up. But the integration with my TV was perfect.  It recognized the TV (Samsung smart TV) and after two steps to verify, it was connected. Simple and easy to use.

  The Streaming Stick + is a snap to install and set up.  The menus are easy to navigate and searching for channels is simple.  Using the Roku is intuitive but it did take some time to activate a handful of services I've purchased.  The video and audio quality is pretty good but not spectacular.  Physical discs definitely out perform streaming media.  The mobile remote app is just ok.  It mostly works but can be a bit cumbersome to use.  Overall, I'm happy with the Roku.  It's a good value and a great way to get into streaming media.

  I use this with my Tablo Over The Air DVR, as well as with all the streaming services. The best feature this has over it's competitor Fire TV, is that I can control everything with the Roku remote hand unit. It not only does the usual Roku stuff, but it turns the TV on/off, and controls the volume. It's a small thing, but there is a lot less screwing around looking for and changing remotes, especially in the dark. This is my second purchase of a like Roku and my 4th purchase of any Roku. I prefer these over Fire TV of which I have two of. The Roku voice search also gives a more detailed list of what's on where at no charge.

  Where has this been? We were streaming through our blu-ray player and it was becoming nightmarishly frustrating with all the re-starts and not playing of episodes. This device steams perfectly without a single glitch so far. Very easy to set up and use, very easy to add channels, and I was very happy to be able to watch “Bill & Ted Face the Music” on premiere weekend with it. I love having the remote app on my phone. We haven’t tried integrating it with Alexa yet, but I plan on it. This was so worth it.

  While it's simple to plug in etc., all the screens are mainly focussed on junk to buy.  Simply streaming YouTube isn't simple or clear.

  This was not a good quality streaming device. It uses WiFi instead of a wired connection and had frequent lags (delays and loading bar showing).

  It works much better than the firestick for sure. Streaming is consistant and picture quality is really good. I do like the sound leveling feature. It makes watching Netflix much more enjoyable. It is easy to use and navigate which is something I personally prefer. I dont need unnecessary bells and whistles that I will never use getting in my way. Netflix and Prime play very well through the Roku, now I just wish Sling would fix the glitches in their systems and I would have the perfect, inexpensive, television system. I am still glad that I got rid of cable though.

  I'm a fan of Roku and their interface. The stick worked fine until it didn't under two years later.

  I am using it on a TV that is the farthest from our WiFi router. It is in the kitchen and we had just gotten a brand new Toshiba small screen; but larger than our old TV that we replaced. It has HDR. I'm not sure yet what 4K means so can't comment. The HDR is fabulous and the player is much faster in terms of viewing and navigating the different channels such as NetFlix. We are very, very pleased with it as you can see by the rating. :BIG SMILE:

  It takes a lot for me to change. I'm not one to need the newest and best. Just a pragmatic kinda-guy. But WOW! The Roku Streaming Stick FAR EXCEEDED my expectations. My old Roku was so stinking slow! It was slow to boot up. It would pause to upload during a show. It was even slow to receive remote commands. I got a ChromeCast for Christmas but since I don't have a Smart TV I found it almost useless. I exchanged it for this Roku Streaming Stick and am absolutely delighted. Super fast at all the above. Voice commands are solid. Vast selection of FREE Streaming Channels. Easy connection to my subscriptions. Computer screen casting is as easy as the ChromeCast (at least for Macs).

  This cheap device is perfect for us. We only have Hulu and I watch a lot of docs on YouTube. I love that I can cast YouTube from my phone! I don't have to search for what I want on the TV keyboard. The picture quality could be a little better but for a bedroom TV that's really just for me, and I'm not picky, I would highly recommend.

  The set up was pretty easy, but a little time consuming mainly because I input account info for the premium channels and streaming services we subscribe to. Excellent and easy to use home screen. Nice remote that lets you power on TV, adjust volume - easy to see. I didn't use the voice recognition yet or hook it up to Alexa, but I'm sure it will be fine. I bought one for everyone in the household. Love it!

  Remote is garbage. I bought two of these in about three months ago because my cable provider has access to their content only on Roku. I found the one remote was going through batteries like crazy. Recently my wife said do you hear that high pitched noise. It ended up being the remote making an audible internal high pitch whine. The other remote we have doesn't do this. Faulty equipment I've never had these issues with any of the fire devices I've bought. Im not happy with the quality if this product.

  I bought the cheaper one for my tv and i loved it so i thought i would upgrade for another one of my tv and bought this one.  I couldn't get these one onto my computer and i called and they said that i need to pay a monthly fee.  So i returned this one and bought they cheaper one, which is 30.00 .  This one does not have a monthly fee to use it.

  The only device in our household that cannot retrieve an internet signal, despite repeated attempts to reset device and router. Roku and Amazon support unable to resolve.

  I have used the roku since the Roku 2 and LT model.  This is a great improvement.  I was having problems with receiving wifi with the older Roku Ultra model but after replacing it with the stick, the wifi came in perfectly.  Amazing considering it is much smaller than the ultra.  The TV I put it on can't display 4k, only 1080, but who cares, at least I have strong wifi and its another TV I can enjoy my programs on.

  This was virtually painless to install. I've had roku for years now and it's always been a huge headache just to get it up and running. Not with this. Simple to install, did it in under a half hour as most of it was loading and signing into roku + channels and viola, finished. It was that easy. I can't comment on the voice recognition or alexa because I don't particularly like to use them.

  As I joined the cord-cutting movement, I opted for Amazon’s firestick. While I am slightly dismayed that the cost savings where not as eye-popping as I’d hoped; due to the need to subscribe to some app subscriptions to continue viewing some of my favorite shows, the savings I sought where there. Though I’m not yet overjoyed by the move, I am still happy I made the move away from the ever increasing cost of cable television and am pleased with the service the firestick provides.

  The devide is great for searching the various streaming videos (we have Netflix, Prime, Disney+ and Hulu) but I did not realize that I needed to buy the more expensive version to control volumn and set turn on/off.

  We bought the Fire Stick for discovery+ and found it very easy to install and connect.  Voice recognition works well on both male and female voices.  When we get an additional one for another tv set, we'll probably upgrade to avoid swapping remote controls a lot.  Since we're both quite ancient (I'm still waiting for DOS to come back) I would have liked more complete written instructions on its operation.  Not a real problem once I found lots of tips on line.

  Had this fire stick lite for about two weeks.  Was easy to install and set up.  I wanted a low cost option for streaming to add to my not-smart TV and this fit the bill.  Only issue I have had is sound went dead at one point, one time.  I had to unplug power source and unplug the stick and then reconnect both the stick and power.  Sound came back and has been working fine since.  Other than that minor issue, fire stick lite was just what I expected and has worked out fine so far.

  We use this Roku on an upstairs den TV, with our wireless modem being downstairs, and this has zero issues with streaming quality. There are some app issues that Roku itself has (can't get HBO Max, certain features within each app), but aside from that the Roku works great (better than the Fire Stick we were using that constantly needed to be unplugged or reset). One of the best features of this Roku is that the remote can be programmed to control the TV power and volume.

  I have every streaming device that is out there and this is by far the worst. I have a very well setup TV with a strong high speed wireless connection. All devices (except the Roku) can stream in 4k resolution no problem and function well. I have tried 2 different Roku devices and both stream in low quality no matter what I do. Both consistently cut out and need to be restarted.  And both have very poor interfaces and general functionality. I will NEVER buy another Roku product.

The whole process is easy and, so far, without issue. I just saved myself $100 a month! Yes!

  The Roku Streaming Stick + delivers what it promises. I'm not a techie person but it was quite easy to set up. The streaming movies are very high quality and there is zero hesitation or pixelation. I still have not figured out how to use all the features, but I do NOT anticipate it will be a difficult.The best part is that the Roku Streaming Stick+ represents my family's first step in cutting the cord. Our cable bills were getting pricey and we did not watch 90% of the channels on our Direct TV package. We immediately cut our premium Direct TV channels and have not missed a beat. You truly can not beat the value it represents. Overall, the Roku is well worth the money upfront plus you save each month by cutting the cord. You will not regret your purchase!

  If you are debating on getting this do it. We have a Roku tv in the bedroom and wanted a smart tv for the living room but didn’t want to spend the money.

We didn’t realize the quality sucked so bad on the chromecast until we got this. Also we can watch cable through the spectrum app so we literally only need this one remote now.

  Roku will never fix their remote!  You have to take the batteries out of the remote daily.  You also have to unplug the Roku stick every day because taking the batteries out of the remote and putting them back in again only works for about an hour or so, then when that stops working you have to go back and unplug the Roku to have a 50% chance that it fixes the issue.  Roku knows this is a problem and they refuse to fix it!

  I bought a Roku TV earlier this year and immediately fell in love with the interface and options, so I bought this device for my non-smart TV. Its really easy to use both the controller and interface, its easy to add channels, especially if you have a Roku account, it automatically downloaded all the apps I had on my Roku TV. The voice is like any voice-activated device, it gets it most of the time. It loads pretty quickly, and it sinks to the TV, so I only use one remote. Definitely happy with the purchase and would recommend it over other streaming devices. And yes, you can link your prime account.

  10 months after purchase it just stopped working. Unplugging and reconnecting power would fix it for 10 minutes or so and then it would fail.

  Fast response, even though my television set is on another floor from the router.  Have noticed that the Roku has ""frozen"" a few times, which is fixed by simply unplugging and then replugging into the HDMI port.  Given that I can easily reach the ports without moving anything, this is a minor inconvenience.  If it were to be plugged into a hard to access HDMI port this could be a bigger problem.

  I love this device and all the apps I am able to use with it (Netflix, HBOGO, Amazon Prime, Pandora, BeachBody OnDemand, etc). My only problem is after about a month of use, I've begun to encounter daily issues with Roku dropping connection. When connection is lost Roku freezes and it's difficult to even get back to the homepage so all I can do is reach behind my TV and press the reset button on the Roku stick. This occurs whether the TV has been off for several hours or even while I'm actively watching something. Everytime it happens I check my Wifi connection and other devices and there is never anything wrong. So then I have to reset the Roku, sometimes it takes several tries before it connects again. I have my internet router positioned directly beside the TV with the Roku stick. I have the Roku stick connected to a power outlet (using the cords and adapters provided by Roku). None of my other devices lose connection like this. It's unfortunate because otherwise I'd say this is a fantastic little device.

  Purchased in part because it’s supposed to turn tv on and off to eliminate the need for multiple remotes. TV is 2 year old Sony so should work. Roku support is poor, said it’s a common issue yet could not resolve. Msg says remote does not support voice control. Said they will escalate but not calls back no timeframe to call back.

  I have used Roku’s from the first generation, this model is my favorite for a few reasons:- fast performance (no noticeable difference between the speed of my 2017 “ultra”)- able to be powered from TV USB port- remote includes power and volume function for TV. This is a game changer as we only pull out the TV remote to change inputs occasionally now.

  We bought this as a replacement for our older ROKU; however, it has proven to almost non-functional.  It overheats, even when placed in a position with nothing but open space around it.  It continually displays a HDPC error message, which requires a hard reboot to correct.  Reboots typically take at least 5 minutes to accomplish.  I don't need to sit around waiting for this to happen, with no guarantee that I won't have to repeat the process multiple times, when I want to stream content.  Our Amazon and Chrome devices to do not exhibit these annoying characteristics; I would recommend one of them.

  This device is terrible! Every time we use it the remote or Roku freezes. We spend 10 min pressing the same button over and over, sometimes it will eventually work and other times we just give up. The remote will always adjust the volume so it’s definitely a problem with the remote/Roku combination and not the tv. We have used other Roku systems without a problem but this one is junk!!! I would give zero stars if I could.

  Having the previous generation Roku Premier+ on our primary TV I was getting frustrated with our Gen 1 Chromecasts on our other TVs.  So I picked up the new Streaming Stick+ on Black Friday.  One word, Wow.  It grabbed our channels from the Premier+ and set up the Stick+.  The unified remote is great.  At least for my Samsung TV.  I haven't played with the voice search yet.  But I haven't had any issues with the unit.  No dropped connections.  No lagging (Google WiFi mesh).  Donated the Chromecast to a local school.

  Menus are a pain to navigate compared to a standard cable box and the signal will randomly buffer for seemingly no reason, but that is more an issue with my cable company and their app than the Roku itself.

  This is my third Roku.  I like the interfaces.  The remote on the streaming stick+ is excellent.  The power button and volume buttons work great on my TV.  Thus, I can use the Roku remote all the time.I rated it only 4 stars for the lack of Dolby Vision.  If you have a Dolby Vision TV (and don't want to use the built in smart apps) then consider using a streaming device other than a Roku.  In my case I use the Rokus on my older HD TVs, and use a 2019 Nvidia Sheild Pro on my main 4k TV with Dolby Vision.

  Cable is getting so expensive in our area, and is going up even more in a few days, that we finally decided to ""cut the cable"".  After doing alot of research, we decided to get a Roku stick.  I hooked it up on my small kitchen tv and I couldnt believe how clear the picture was.  Very easy to hook up and the Roku practically set itself up.  So I ended up sending for another Roku stick for the bedroom tv, and the Roku Ultra for the living room tv. All tv's come in as good, or better than cable. Wish we would of done this long ago.  The only negative thing I have to say is there is no mute button on the remote. Very happy with this purchase =)

  I bought this to replace a Roku 3 in a bedroom.  As it plugs right in to the TV's HDMI & USB port for power I don't have to see the box hanging about or keep it plugged in to a power socket.  It's highly portable and I've traveled with it.  Seems faster than the Roku 3 and of course is 4K capable.  Great for streaming off a media server across the house as my Roku Ultra in the main room is connected directly.  Paid $50 on Prime Day but worth the retail price.

  I love this Firestick so much, For $29.99 it lets me watch so much different TV, it integrates well with the Alexa and love the voice command. Great value for the price

   Es la primera vez que pruebo uno y la verdad me encantó fluidez y rendimiento están bastante buenos, lo único que me hubiera gustado es que la alimentación fuera por el mismo puerto HDMI para no tener que poner más cables conectando el cargador, fuera de esto está genial, espero comprarme ahora la versión que soporta 4k y está obsequiarla.

  I love everything about Fire stick, especially with the Alexa portion of it.  One thing I do wish was different, is when u trigger the screen saver, it doesn't hold yr place in line.  It goes back to something else, like another show or back to the beginning to the home screen.  Then if u forget what episode you're watching, u have to go back through all yr episodes to figure it out

  Wanted a second fire stick for our bedroom because we recently set up a projector. This Lite version is perfect because the projector and sound are separate so we didn’t need those buttons on the remote. Other than that it works the same as our normal fire stick. This was a perfect option that was a bit more cost effective. Would definitely recommend.

  It goes blank sometimes and audio is off. I have power off and on constantly. I was told to reset it to factory and also remove 3"" hdmi cable. This is on my Emerson tv that is 10 yrs old. But that shouldn't matter. NEVER had problems with audio or anything till I installed the fire tv lite. It's a piece of crap.

  I love this! I finally cut my cord and bought two of these for my 2 TVs. If I had known how easy it was to set up and get started I would have done earlier. I was replacing cable with my TiVo box with this and although I find the UI not quite as good as TiVo, it’s pretty great. I have all my apps set up and watch live tv when I want through YouTube tv. The remote works well but a little flimsy but I do like that Netflix (and others) have their own button. I haven’t yet used my phone for remote but it’s great that is an option, especially since the buttons on the remote don’t light up.If you are even thinking about it, just do it. It’s a very reasonable price for such a high quality service.

  Piece of garbage. It does not connect to internet despite being the extended range model and have 75 percent of WiFi. To fix I undertake the following: restarting the device for 30 minutes, unplugging and restarting until 50 percent of the time it connects. Often I have to reset the device and completely start over with it, which takes about 20 minutes anyway.  I’ve attempted to contact roku to resolve the issue (replace) and they do nothing. I own three other rokus and two of the other three work pretty well. All seem to suffer from connection issues. I’m trashing this one and getting Apple TV I don’t see the same issues with them. In the end don’t buy this, doesn’t work as advertised and if you have an issue expect no help from Roku.

  I don't like writing bad reviews, but I feel like I had to on this specific device.Before you'll starting reading inside I'll just say in Advance: I have no idea if the device is good or not since I've not used it. the low score comes from the awful feeling I've gotten from it.By no choice, take this rating as ""the device is bad and you shouldn't buy it"" but just as my feeling towards the device.So, I've ordered the Roku Streaming Stick+ 2 months ago since I've started using netflix, and my girlfriend wanted to watch it on her TV (which is not a smart TV). Fast forward a month, the streamer has yet to arrive, and once I contact the support, they tell me it's probably lost in the shipping, and that they will send me a new device.After another month of waiting, the device finally shows up. I'm going to my-girlfriend house to try and start-up the Roku device, and it fails. trying to figure out what I am doing wrong with all the troubleshooting guides inside of Roku's site without successes, and after contacting the Roku's live support, it turns out that my Roku device is probably just a defect and I'll need to wait another month if I want another device.Now, I don't know about anyone reading the review, but I wouldn't like waiting 3 months for a single streaming device, and therefore I've asked for a refund.I'm writing this review mostly because of my disappointment, and the waste of my 2 months. and I've gave it 2 stars because I feel as the live support representatives were nice. I for one, will probably not order this item again, But as I've said in the begging, I have no idea how to device works, or if he's good enough once he's working.Thank you for your time reading my review.Nir.

  Wow. I feel sooo stoopid!!! I should have bought this when I first heard of Roku. it's so much better than cable!! It's super easy to install, easy to use....User friendly remote. I bought Hulu plus so I can stream live TV as well...I am now saving $100 a month vs what I had been playing for cable! Side note, I also bought a modem, so all I am playing for is internet.

  A good answer for someone looking to get rid of cable box rentals, the rest of the content is a welcome bonus. It really is great for streaming. I also have fire sticks to get what isn't offered on the roku. I actually got the fire sticks first, but unfortunately they don't have the Xfinity app available.

  I liked be able to see the channels that I like. I did not use the voice recognition nor alexa with it. I found it was easier to add channels to the roku, by using my computer instead of the arrows on the remote. The streaming to the roku was much better faster than when I tried to use the computer alone.

  So far this item has worked well.  However, I can't give them five stars because I have been having trouble with the remote.  In one day's time, the remote quit two times.  I have had to shake it to make it work again.  I'm afraid it is going to quite working completely.  The actual stick words very well and is easy to install.I am happy to be able to give Roku five stars --  I had trouble with my first remote and they quickly sent me a new one.  Everything is working fine and canceling my Frontier TV and buying a Roku Streaming Stick was one of the best moves I have made. I now have much more TV access and at a lower rate than ever before.  There is no comparison between Frontier TV and all the great access you have through using a streaming device.  I liked the Roku  stick so well that I bought a second one for my other TV.

  Update: I discovered from several online forums there is an issue with Samsung 4K HDR TVs and Roku. You must force the Roku to use regular 4K and not the 4K HDR display setting to avoid the terrible image quality. Still not perfect but at least watchable now.Original Review:This device is awesome with 60 fps channels and regular tv at 30 fps but is unwatchable with live sports at 30 fps. With Youtube TV the local sports channels are transmitted at 30 fps and the on screen image is horrific.Since I bought because I could have online DVR on sports channels I cannot use this devuice. Bought a Nvidia shield and 30 FPS is watchable even though its not as good as DTV 1080i.

  I originally bought a Firestick, and was cool with it...But it didn’t have the Xfinity app available to watch live tv on my outdoor projector.This may not be a deal breaker for some, but it was something I wanted for my outdoor viewing.I gave the firestick a 4/5 star, so for that reason, I give the Roku 5 stars.

  We finally decided to do away with cable and got the Roku Streaming Stick Plus and our only regret is that we didn't do it a lot sooner! It was easy to set up, and very easy to operate. The only issue we have is that occasionally it will freeze up on the welcome screen but we just have to unplug the power from the Roku stick for about 10 seconds and then plug it back in to reboot it and then it's fine. We used to have to do this with our cable box as well so it could just be our internet service. If we decide to purchase another streaming device we'd definitely stick with a Roku!

  We decided to cancel our cable to save money by going to streaming video.  I was sick of paying so much for channels we never watched.  I have Cat 6 Ethernet cables to all of my TV locations, so I initially purchased two Roku Ultras, which support Ethernet connections.  They work great and I'm very pleased with their quality and performance.  I decided to try the Streaming Stick+ to test a wireless connection to the TV in my office.  I am also very pleased with the performance of the Roku Streaming Stick+.  I intend to purchase additional Ultras for the rest of our indoor TVs and move the Streaming Stick + to the outside TV on our deck.  I have recommended both the Roku Ultra and Streaming Stick+ to friends who are considering cutting their cable.

  It allowed me to have an inexpensive way to update my system. My 10 year old Sony Blu-Ray DVD player is no longer supported by Amazon Prime or Netflix (and probably many more). With this Roku streaming device, I now can get those services. And, the update cost me <$50. I was able to set it up myself too!!!

   Really good investment! I was going to buy a Roku TV but I didn’t want to pay $400 to get the same size TV that I already have and I didn’t want to downsize either. If it wasn’t for the Prime Day deal I probably would’ve never thought to buy it. It took 5 minutes to set up and BOOM, I have a Roku TV 🤷🏽‍♀️🙂

  The Roku worked great for the first 2 months.  After 2 months the remote started to drain the batteries.  Within 1 week the batteries were dead.  There is ABSOLUTELY no customer support from Roku.  They make a great product but if a problem happens you have to buy a new unit.

  definitely better than the entry level roku.  cleaner installation and power/volume on remote is much more convenient.  one quibble...bought this brand new, not refurbished.  after 2 weeks, the remote batteries were dead.  minor inconvenience, but remote batteries should last for a year, not a couple of weeks.

  So far have loved everything about the Roku Streaming Stick.  It's extremely easy to set up and use.  There are,  between all the different channels,  1000""s of free movies,  TV series,  or access to your favorite TV programs.  Of course you can subscribe as well,  but right now,  we're very happy with what's free.  I have since ordered a Roku Sound bar and still waiting for it to arrive.  I highly recommend the Roku Stick.

  Love this Roku, easy to install and I’m saving about $100 a month from cable including the apps I’m paying for.

  Love this little stick!! It works great! I don’t have very good WiFi strength in my bedroom so I got this stick because it has a WiFi extension thing on it. It obviously works cause I don’t have any problems now! The only downside for me is that it isn’t comparable with my TV which is strange. I have a new “element” brand TV. Maybe that’s not a big brand or something?  All that means is that I can’t control the volume with the Roku remote. No biggie though! I really like it and I have recommended it to a few people already. I’ve had it about a month so far.

  We recently went from cable to streaming tv, it was a little iffy at first so we purchased several of these Roku sticks and ever since the streaming service has been fantastic.This stick turns any tv with a USB port into a Roku tv, this allows you to stream your tv service rather than use a cable or dish service. It's easy to use, similar to choosing an app on your smart phone but you're choosing it on your television screen using a the included remote. We have no issues with streaming hanging or buffering since we added the Roku stick.Great product, we are very happy with the purchase and it has helped to save us hundreds monthly using Roku and a streaming service over cable.I highly recommend this product.

  First time ever to use a Roku. Quick and easy to set up. I cut the cord 3 years ago and had been using a Samsung Blue Ray player to stream Netflix & YouTube to my 2014 LG Led HD TV (not a smart TV). I thought it was really great, until I received the Roku on December 21st. I watched a video on Amazon.com to see how to connect it to my TV. It took maybe less then 5 minutes total for me to have the Roku all set up and running and then I continued watching the movie I had been watching earlier on Netflix with the Blue Ray before the Roku came to my door, but now using the Roku. WONDERFUL!!! The quality of the picture is fantastic! Love that I only need one remote now. I am so happy with this product. No cords hanging, just used the HDMI (2) slot and the USB port and that was it. I still have my Blue Ray in the HDMI(1) spot to watch DVD""s. This device is incredible! One of my brother's asked me, ""is it legal?"" With all the stations available, with many FREE movies, I will NEVER go back to a subscription TV service again! THANK YOU ROKU!!! Best Christmas present ever!!!

  I am disturbed by the fact that Roku doesn't tell you that their voice recognition is not compatible with YouTube TV.  In other words, if you want to stream CBS News (as an example) if you're using YouTube TV streaming services, you will not get the streaming from YouTube TV but rather the 3rd party app supplied by Roku.I've been mistakenly using the voice commands and getting the 3rd party streaming versions, and if you do not know, they ARE DIFFERENT from what's on YouTube TV.  I paid $20 extra each for 3 Roku Steaming Sticks + for no reason.  Maybe they'll trade down for me?

  I normally dont write these but this is the second ROKU device I bought over the last week. Both have had issues. This one wouldn't let me watch tv. It kept saying HDCP error 020. I followed the instructions on the screen and nothing helped! I know its not my inputs since I have used them with the xbox but I wanted something smaller in my living room. So annoyed! I want to love this since sooo many people do but I didnt spend 50 dollars to buy my own HDMI cable and hope it works! I will be returning it.

  I've been thinking about getting out of the Comcast monopoly for awhile now, and this Roku allowed me to pull the trigger! I switched to a slower 20MB internet with small local provider, but I still get HD quality on my TV! Surprisingly I feel like the picture quality is better than the xfinity X1 platform. I opted to go with PlayStation vue streaming service which I am enjoying thus far. Also easy to access amazon TV and Netflix. I'll save about 2,000 this year using the roku player, well worth the price.

  Roku is great for streaming.  Being shut in during COVID, we enjoyed  watching Amazon Prime movies and shows.  I hoped to mirror my  Windows 10 PC,.  The computer recognizes that there is another screen and a Roku device, but it will not mirror.  All the community instructions are for a Roku app on a windows phone, not a PC.  I am disappointed.  Roku has no support.

  I've been using Roku for years and years. I'm amazed that this little Roku ""stick"" is way more powerful that the old Roku 3 box that I was using before. If anybody's interested in K-Drama, I use this Roku almost exclusively for ""Kocowa"" - it's a Korean Drama channel that has a special (Roku only) feature: It allows you to watch in without subtitles unless you use the replay (skip back) button,  then it shows you the English subtitles for that part only. Good for anyone learning Korean.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! AAA+++

  We had issues with our DVD player that we also used to stream video, so we purchased the stick. It's worked extremely well. Easy to set up. The voice search is tons easier than typing in items. The only reason for not giving it five stars is a feature few devices now have: showing the running time of what we're watching - you have to hit pause to see that information. This feature might be possible on the Roku box, but it didn't offer it, so we got the stick. If you're having issues with your DVD player/streaming device, definitely go with a Roku.

Then we innocently give it as a gift and boom, our log on info is all there. NOT SMART AMAZON! Not smart at all!

  Try this before you buy a smart TV with the same definition. The voice recognition is spot on, the stream quality is excellent, and the Alexa integration works great. The same as my echo dot, but you have to press the button instead.

  It stopped working after 2 months.  I have two others with no problems whatsoever.  I tried the stick on my other TV's and it just doesn't work.  The TV's don't recognize that this particular stick is plugged in.  It's just defective from the beginning.  It was almost impossible to plug into the port, the power cord was just as difficult to plug into the stick.  Will need to determine if there is a warranty.

  Moved outside of a Comcast area and made the decisison to cut the cord. ROKU is amazing and runs well off a 25MBPS internet connection. Everything is on demand and with the additional Hulu subscription it is better than cable or Satelite. Setup is easy and quick. Love this thing and we have 4 in our house now. Also, you  an place TVs anywhere and you don't need to worry about running ugly coax cables all over the room.

  Would not buy again, it's not worth the frustration of having to install new batteries every two to three days even with little to no use during that time frame. Brand new Duracell batteries lasted 4 days. I'm absolutely unhappy with this device's remote, will be returning it for a refund.

  This is our first time using a Roku device, or any live streaming device for that matter, and I am not impressed. We use the Roku for Hulu live TV and the Roku is constantly disconnecting from the internet (we have 100 mbps, can't imagine what it's be like with slower internet) and we are forced to restart the Roku every time. This is all after only having the Roku for a day and a half. Needless to say, we are going to be switching back to cable.

  Returned to Roku as we had tried a different kind of streaming product that did not work. The other product kept making my TV freeze up and the voices would get out of sync numerous times during shows, and I even had to turn some programs off because of it.  Never have this issue when I'm using Roku.

  Seems like a great little unit and was fine for a few months but then started having little glitches... freezing, running slow, even once got an error message it was over heating... lately has started loading and showing connected but just won’t do anything. We’ve been able to get past this for a couple months by turning tv on/off or just waiting 3 minutes but now, nothing. New remote batteries, disconnected from tv, unplugged and reset tv... nothing it just stopped working. Disappointed roku has always been so good. Shouldn’t have to replace electronics in less than a year.

  This product was most annoying.  One has to hit a button several times while shaking or jarring the remote to get it to work.  IT IS THE WORST thing I have ever experienced in a remote.  I wanted to return it but I didn't know what the time frame for return was.  I have another ROKU that works perfectly in another room but it doesn't have voice capability.  I was extremely disappointed.

  Would never buy again. Remote stopped pairing after a year. I’ve tried all of the troubleshooting and switched batteries a ton, the stick and the remote just aren’t pairing. I can’t even control the device through my IOS app as a backup because the ROKU has dropped from my network, but I can’t re-connect the stick to my network without the remote. I also can’t add the device manually to my app because I need the remote to check the settings to get the IP address. What a waste of money.

  The remote died after 6 months.  Impossible to get a replacement for a decent price.  The Android app connects maybe 1 out of 5 tries and only then after 5 minutes of searching.  Of course, it forgets everything if you turn your phone off for more than a minute.  Piece of junk, I'm going back to the Amazon Fire.  I didn't like the UI of it, but at least the remote works even after my dogs got ahold of it and chewed it up and it stayed in a rainstorm overnight.

  This has awesome quality. No problem setting up. I was NOT asked for a cc #. BUT my stick and plug was HOT TO TOUCH. I returned and was sent another one. Same problem. I'm not going to bother with a third. It's sad to say that after I researched 'over heating' in reviews quite a few appeared. Now I dont know what to do :(Thanks to Amazon for making returns painless!!!

  Had this for just one two months and the USB power adaptor cord is bad. Was intermittent and then just quit.

Great service Amazon (not)

  I got a deal on an LG 32"" TV smart TV that has a great picture, but was extremely frustrated by the clunky interface. The Fire Stick Lite changed all that!

  My son got a TV for Christmas so I bought him a firestick so he could watch Disney plus and other kid friendly shows.

  I would probably rate it higher if we did not have to get up and disconnect and then reconnect the power supply every time we go to access it. It is the only way the unit actually works and powers on...otherwise we would be forced to watch a blue screen, that’s as far is it goes by itself. :(

  Got this to replace my FireTV once Amazon made it impossible to access YouTube anymore.  I like it better and I don't think I'd go back even if they sorted it out.  Volume and power control on the Roku remote.  Buttons that go STRAIGHT to Netflix, Hulu, Sling and Playstation Vue.  Takes commands through Alexa if you're willing to spring for a $1 per month subscription to Quick Remote.  All around worth it.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

  I've had a Roku 3 for six years, and it still works fine. Upgraded a few months ago to a Streaming Stick, mainly for the supposedly improved remote, and connected the old device to the downstairs TV. Unfortunately, the ""improved"" remote  cuts out on a regular basis, sometimes for a few seconds, sometimes for way longer than that.  My wi-fi hums, and the Roku app  on my phone works even when the remote cuts out. So the problem is the remote. I've changed the batteries, re-paired it with the stick, shaken and stirred it. But nothing helps for long. I'd ask for a new one but nobody's minding the store.Called customer support 3x today and it was unreachable -- phone tree goes in circles, eventually tells you to try again later.  Website's no help. May fall back on pairing my old remote with the stick, which of course would leave me with a defective remote for the Roku 3. Can you say Apple TV?

  I bought this to replace an Amazon Firestick I used for a treadmill in my basement.  I cannot believe how much better this works.  I have another Amazon Firestick that I use for a TV that is 4 feet from my router.  It works OK, but the Roku is MUCH better at a distance and much easier to use.

  I chose the Roku because my Amazon Firestick wouldn't recognize YouTube TV. Aparently there is some sort of trade war going on between Amazon and YouTube? Anyway, I installed the unit and it immediatly brough up the easy to use menu and applications. The remote was easy to program to my Sony TV. The setup was easy and worked right away. Everything works really well. I don't use the voice commands often. But they actually work really good too. Very happy. And happy with my YouTube TV package too.

  There is NO support from Roku in setting up device.  We already had Roku, just got new one (12-16-20) for another TV, directions for setting up unclear.  The 3 phone numbers for Roku ALL had same msg: not taking ANY phone calls, referred to their website for assistance . . . Which NOT helpful.  We saw negative review from 2019 about same issue.  Figured by now there’d be no problem.  WRONG!  If you order Roku for Christmas present good luck on setting it up unless you have a computer whiz.  Of course Roku makes sales so they are not concerned with customer service.  They are a TERRIBLE company.

  DO NOT BUY ROKU PRODUCTS: Worked great for about a month. Then I started having trouble with the sound coming on with the system.  But cut it off and back on the sound would work.  Then it started freezing up in the selections.  It would work then suddenly it would not move to another movie or tv show in the list of choices.  Again a cut on and off usually fixed it but not every time.  NOW? nothing. All it will do is the purple ROKU bouncing icon.  I have tried everything listed in the forums and online vids to fix it that I can find. NOTHING works.  for roughly sixty bucks shouldn't it work a year or two?STUPID ME: bought a second one. You know. Give them the benefit that maybe it was just a ""bad one"". HA>....This one has stopped working now.  Roku turns on. Shows my channels. I can move from channel to channel.  Can search up/down, left/right all I want. That's it. WHen you push the selector to have a channel open up to watch. NOTHING HAPPENS. You hear the beep.  NOTHING HAPPENS. NOTHING OPENS> NOTHING can be watched.  Wrote Roku support.  They would get back to me soon in a standard email.  It's been two weeks and NOTHING HAPPENS from ROKU SUPPORT. DONT BUY THEIR CRAP they are ripping us off and AMAZON is helping them do it.

  We switched from Direct TV to Cincinnati Bell which is much cheaper. Our square Roku box, about 4 yrs old would not sync with the new signal.

  It’s a small, easy to use remote, and the device itself is easy to set up. The good news is, there’s a Disney+ button. The bad news? It doesn’t do anything. The good news? Supposedly, you can get HBO Max on Roku.  The bad news, only by using your iPad Airplay function. I’m using it, but before you buy it, you should see if there’s a streaming media player that does more.

  I bought this less than 2 months ago. It sat around in the box for a little while before I finally set it up. It was easy to setup and my first impressions were positive. However, my kids are now complaining that they get a few minutes into a show and it shows an error message about overheating and shuts off. Sure enough, I touched the stick and it was burning hot. I've had lots of streaming devices, including previous Roku devices, and have never seen this before.

  Having always plugged in my MacBook Pro to whatever TV I own at the time, this wasn't a must-have product for me. It was more of a convenience, a way to watch Netflix without needing to move and connect my laptop, and anything else would be a bonus. I owned a Smart TV while living in Germany and had too many problems to justify spending the extra money on one again when I could just use my laptop. (I travel a lot and usually only live somewhere for a year or two, so the less I can spend on a TV, the better.)I must say, this little streaming stick went above and beyond my expectations. I have never written a review for a product on Amazon before, that's how much I love this thing. Being in SE Asia now, I don't have access to a lot of content, but with Netflix, Plex, and YouTube, it's already more than enough. (Having Spotify would make it perfect, but that's not Roku's fault.) And with silent listening from my phone, I can watch at any time without needing to worry about waking up anyone else in the house. (Perfect for roommates or significant others trying to sleep way earlier than you want to.)The icing on the cake, though, and what drove me to leave this review, is the advanced wireless receiver. My bedroom is down a long hallway in the house, and my laptop and iPhone have a hard time picking it up during the best of times. Not so with the Roku. I was getting HD quality content on the TV. I might even be getting better quality content in the main room where the router is because of this. Maybe I'm still so overly impressed and it's affecting my judgement, but I could swear that it never looked as good when I was using my laptop.Needless to say, I'm going to be using this for a long time to come. Maybe next time I'll spring for a 4K TV, but even without one, this thing is seriously amazing. Best value for money I've ever spent.

  The person who said she was charged $70.00 to set up her roku got scammed. There is no charge no matter how many you rokus you have. Sounds like she clicked on an unofficial site for help and got scammed, so beware. It's happening to other customers according to what I've read.  I'm happy with the device, have several and paid nothing to set them up.

  The remote burns through the pair of AAA batteries on a weekly basis.  This appears to be a known fault with many customers reporting the same issue on the Roku site.  Each report gets an ambiguous response to send a Direct Message (DM) to a guy named Danny for more help.  I sent 3 DMs to Dany without any response or support.I wanted so much to like Roku but this is an annoyance.It is a faster streaming stick than the competition so my answer is to buy rechargeable AAA batteries from the same competition.  Call me crazy :)

  I love the ROKU streaming devives ( I purchased two) However, the remote to one of them stop completely working after just a couple weeks. I had to download the remote on my phone & this is what I use to operate my Roku device. The 2nd one I purchased, I haven't used yet. Though I purchased 1 in November & the other in December, I didn't set the one im using up until Feb because I still had cable. Now I have to contact ROKU C/S to see how or if I can purchase a remote. Hopefully, I won't have this problem with the 2nd remote. My sister has had her ROKU for years & never had a problem with her remote.

  I was so excited for this to start using and Amazon did a quick job in delivering before time but The device is getting overheated. When I don't even start any app the temperature is 80 deg Celsius. If I start streaming then it goes above 100 deg Celsius which is more than a boiling water. I will wait and watch few days and then possibly return it as I don't think I can watch on it for even 2-3 hrs. Also I am not getting Dolby Atmos output from it as advertised even though I have Dolby Atmos capable speakers and have enabled Dolby Digital Plus in Roku Audio settings,  so it's very disappointing

  O.K., I was wrong in my first review. I did mention that I was still learning. A week with Roku, many rustrating moments. Getting to know the territory is not what I would call ""user friendly.""Now the Good PartMy daughter, who is my 45 years younger then I am said: You want ""Sling"" and the blue package, (Cost $20 a month)I loaded Sling, again not too easy, but after about three hours I had it done. If you need  help, I will respond.It sure is a lot better than $150 to $200 a month for cable. Sling has ""Live On Air"" shows as well as videos, movies, cable and more. It saved my marriage. My wife is glued to MSNBC, The ""Blue"" package has it, on air!Now ""I Love My Roku"" I am about to buy another.

  Roku is the best streaming player, but needs to add Multicast capabilities!! Please find a way to support this feature on the ESPN app to watch 4 games simultaneously on 1 screen like AppleTV. Roku does a better job than AppleTV of keeping the streaming resolution quality high while streaming. Roku will stay at 4k resolution mostly while AppleTV will drop in and out from 4k to 1080p and it gets annoying.

  Roku is really great.  We got Amazon Prime with out flat screen downstairs.  Using Roku to stream same services to upstairs bedroom.  Works great.  Ridiculous amounts of shows.  Makes you want to become disabled, so you can watch 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!

  We had a older generation of Firestick that required you to reboot it almost 3x a day. With the Roku, you turn it on and it stays on. There is very little issue with it requiring restarts or signal loss. It looks like the people who created and coded this device knew what they were doing.

  Very happy with ROKU just not this model.  The stick overheated!!  The TV displayed a banner reading “The ROKU is OVERHEATING!”  It was extremely hot to touch.  Be careful.....it could have easily caused an electrical fire.

  This is our first venture into ""streaming"" service, and it works very well. We use it for Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, Peacock, and many other services we have either found or were loaded on the Roku.We do not use any type of voice recognition, so not able to review those accessories.

  The Streaming Stick + I received from Amazon was not new.  It had been initalized and registered by another user, which made it impossible to link it to my own Roku account. I only found out because I wanted to add another streaming service app; had I wanted only the ones preloaded, I would never have noticed. I had to contact Roku for support (and the agent was very helpful). The box is sealed with transparent seals, and I don't remember now whether they were already cut when I received it.  Amazon shouldn't be selling used products as new.The stick itself seems to be working correctly, but setup took a long time because it was previously registered. The antenna on the side isn't conspicuous.

  Purchased two units abd love the platform and streaming. Very easy setup and nice selection of options. I want to love this and give 5 stars.HOWEVER BUYER BEWARE!Their remotes eat batteries like nothing I have seen.  What money you save you will lose in cost of batteries.No one seems to review this part.  Major Achilles heal on unit. If it were not for battery issues I would say Best Buy ever!  But the remote and battery issue is a killer.

  Got this for someone else but use Roku myself.  They are all good with the exception of voice control which is not up to par if compared with Fire.I just got another one for a neighbor again and found something strange.  This one used the ""mini"" USB power plug instead of the ""micro"".  I have not seeing anything was using the micro for some time and can't even find them in stores.

  Bought this for the toy room. Good reception. Good quality picture. Only problem is the 4” dongle. We have 3 roku’s and two of them don’t fit in the TV HDMI Slots because they’re too long. This forces you to buy an adapter. The adapter should be automatically included, or change the design.

  Absolute garbage product. The extended power cord is incredibly short and cannot reach an outlet for a mounted TV. The power it can get from the TV’s USB, which is their work around, does not generate enough power for most users so the software then crashes repeatedly. Absolute useless junk, do not buy.

  I would not recommend this product to people living outside the USA. I did find it easy enough to set up, and the quality of streaming was excellent. I did find from the get go that the remote was a bit iffy, or it may have been occasional very slow response. Geo-restriction is a problem, and I could not access Amazon Prime. (I could watch Prime on my Smart TV).I signed up for Acorn TV, but could not load it from the Roku channel store. Roku support told me Acorn was geo-restricted, but Acorn said not. (Again, I could watch on my smart TV).The worst has been Wifi related. Often, when I was downstairs watching Netflix, my wife would call me upstairs as the Roku had stopped working. It had dropped from the wifi network, but was easy to reset, at first. Finally, the unit lost wifi connection, and just would not see my wifi, although it variously saw 3 to 7 of my neighbours' networks. This happened Tuesday, by Friday there was no response from support. So, like the curate's egg, good in parts, but not something I would ever recommend to a friend.

  I like Roku, it has a lot more applications then my smart TV.  The custom home screen is a big plus, remote controls the power and the volume. Overall i'm happy, HOWEVER just a warning, this is the 3rd roku hardware we purchased  and twice already the Roku remote just simply stops working after a few months of use. Batteries are fine, it just stops paring to TV, no matter now many times you reset it, unplug it, nothing works. So its possibly that we just has a faulty hardware (twice) and got really unlucky.

  I like the minimalist remote and device size with a user friendly interface that works with your phone or PC for logins and/or setup. FREE LOGIN AND ACCOUNT! No paying for service just the apps that you own or wish to use. I'd I wasn't a gamer this is all I would have period. YouTube tv, Hulu, Netflix, and others are available. I only need 3 or 4 😐 so in my case worth the money. And if xboxlive/PlayStation Network go down you actually have something to watch 😁.

  My 5-year old Roku was single band and seemed slow.  I ordered model with the fewest extras and was rewarded with a homerun hit.  The external antenna on a dongle makes a difference.  Set up was easier than the previous model.  The payoff is faster loading.  We have had cable TV and a sound bar.  The on/off and sound volume control features don't work with our set up, and we didn't expect them to.  What does work is the ability to link to the highest of the dual band settings of our router.  Faster performance.  Easy set up.  No need to contact tech support.

  Nowhere can you find how to playback recorded shows.  They had shows that could be marked for future viewing but now that doesn't exist anymore and all there is left is to record shows, but without any means of locating and playing them back what good is that.  I tried contacting the technical support of my local TV and internet provider - LUMOS - and they didn't know anything about it.  So now I will try to contact Amazon I guess and see if they are any help.  Very Frustrating!

  Worked fine the first day. Next time we used it we didn’t have any audio. Called customer support and she had me factory reset the unit. Worked then. But next day again no audio.

I plan to send this back very disappointed as we have 3 other fire tv products that are no longer available  for purchase. I guess you do get what you pay for.

  It's just your run of the mill media player. Nothing too special. It's convenient  and cheap, that's about the best thing about it.It's also easy to use for someone who is tech literate. Someone who is not tech literate will have difficulties if not taught how to use it. The control itself is a bit confusing for people who are not tech literate as well.

  Our TV is over 10 years old but it's still good and can compete with many new TV on the market today, only downside is it's not smart. So we decided to give a try to this stick rather than buying new TV, as to watch Netflix was a pain every time connecting through hdmi cable. This stick changed our lives, the old TV is now as smart as it could get, so easy to install and convenient in use. Love it!

  This Roku product is fine.  We started with more basic sticks from both Roku and Amazon, but both of the more basic sticks could not maintain a streaming speed in our location to prevent interruptions of the programs being watched.  Thus, we bought the Roku Streaming Stick + because it was advertised having more range and a faster processor.  So far, we have had no streaming problems with the Roku Streaming Stick +.  It probably deserves a five-star rating, but I would like to see if this stick maintains it streaming speed on all sources before moving it from four-stars to five-stars.

  I originally wanted an Apple TV, but didn't have the cash. Needed something immediate and this was a good buy. I was really impressed with the device and the countless apps available on it. Unfortunately, HBO Max isn't available on it yet, which forces me to use my Xbox One to play that lone app. But the playback and quality of the device led me to have it on every television in the house. I may get an Apple TV later on, but I'm definitely not in any hurry.

  I rarely give 5 stars, but this one rates it I believe.  I just recently purchased a Samsung 4k tv and wanted a compatible streaming device.  The setup is a cinch.  Automatically detected my screen resolution and 4K settings (Also gives you additional choices if you wish)  The picture is stunningly clear and the audio channeling through my sound bar is excellent.  Took just a couple of minutes to log into Netflix, etc and away we go.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting  the latest tech, and to those who have 4k capabilities.  The $70 price tag is definitely worth the investment.

  I'm a Roku fan, think the interface, the remote, and capabilities are first rate. But with this particular product, playback of media that has subtitles is a real problem.  The subtitles will either disappear or lag seriously against the on-screen dialog.  This is not a problem when connecting directly, wired, to either the smart TV or a wired Roku box.

  I have tried other streaming devices and after buying a ROKU TV, I decided to try a ROKU stick for my other large screeen that is not a smart TV.  Between the choices, features and price for my stick- voice recognition on the remote at a price of 29.99 the choice has turned out to be unbeatable.  In addition anyone who streams has suffered buffering or freezing of your program.  I have experienced that ROKU does a better job of holding the stream and recovering than Chromecast.

  I like that it gives a lot more options than what my smart TV gives.  I was hoping that it would pull in the signal better, but i'm not sure that it does.  Signal strength is certainly as good as the TV, but i'm not sure it is much better.  it is close.The apps and the remote are very responsive.  I do not use voice commands with it..

  Works fine if no interference/shielding. I have 2 Roku 3s and 2 Roku sticks. I use the sticks in locations that don't result in interference/shielding issues (buffering circle of death). Since I already have 2 Roku 3s I use the sticks in locations that don't produce the buffering circle. It's kind of a hard engineering challenge since they plug directly into the back side of a flat screen between the metal/circuit board of the TV and the metal wall mount plate (at least in my situation). So, they would not work well in some locations but okay in others. I love how transportable they are.

From the start I thought the Smartcast interface was ‘meh’ at beat, but what really sucked was the TV’s inability to catch a proper WiFi signal, which made the TV pretty useless. Bought this Roku stick, plugged it in, set up the WiFi, and started watching. Never looked at Vizio’s interface again. Ever.

  I ""upgraded"" from a 2014 model Roku with no volume button. I cant say this one is any better. It is extremely slow on bootup and pressing the home button no longer automically turns on the tv and changes the input. I wish i wouldve kept the old one as its boot times were alot faster.

  Works great as we dont need to provide separate power to it if the tv or projector has a powered usb port.The remote doesnt have to be pointed at the device which is a big help.Stream quality is superb with no lags.Detects devices display capability well. Initial setup maybe tricky to make it understand what the resolution of the device is.Remote has a lag.

  The remote struggles to interact with the stick even if you point it at the stick it reacts slowly to select the apps. Volume on remote is perfect however. Im not sure what the deal is but the remote also goes through batteries really fast. My tv remote batteries last a year but the roku is a monthly change. Recently the roku needs me to reconnect the internet through its app anytime i turn on the tv. My router sits 1foot below the stick so and i test at about 30 megs while sitting on the couch or walking in the kitchen which is about10- 20 ft from router. I think the roku is good for the short term but it needs to be replaced in less than a year. Currently debating apple tv and a few others. Too bad honestly since it could be a really good product with a better remote and a more consistent connection. A month ago i would say five stars, but here i am about to have to find another device to stream with so 3 stars is as nice as it gets.

  Fantastic reception with this device,  Very PLEASED!  This is my 3rd Roku in the past 8 months or so, using on 3 separate TV's. Just one observation,  noticed the remote control for 1st one I purchased, which I use most often, seems to burn thru quality Duracell alkaline batteries. These are not old batteries, they are no where close to expiration date. Just changed them again tonight and had to replace about 2 months earlier...again each time with brand new alkaline batteries.  Wondering if other folks have had this experience??

  The Roku Streaming Stick+ is a great piece of hardware. I've had every Roku since the first one and the remote on this one is outstanding, easy to use and fits the hand with ease. I was so impressed with my first Roku Streaming Stick+ that I quickly replaced all my other streaming devices in my house with the Roku Streaming Stick+. The best feature was to link the remote to my tv, cable box and dvd player. With one button I can turn on Roku and start watching within a minute! And being able to watch in 4K is fantastic!

  Gave this to my father-in-law because the Amazon app in his Samsung TV wouldn’t let him FF some shows that worked for me on my Roku. He lives this thing.  PS, he was afraid it wouldn’t work on his tv because of something he heard on the news about not working with old TVs. He has a 3 year old 70” 4K tv, lol. I reminded him that my own tv is a 10 year old 720p Panasonic and it works with Roku just fine.

  I bought this so I could get rid of the cable.  I don't watch that much on TV, but the news that I watch is available on YouTube.  I like being able to access Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc. in one place.  I haven't found too many things on the free channels, but there is lots to choose from.  For me it has been an excellent investment.  The picture quality is excellent - better than my cable was.

  Bought this Roku in December 2019 to replace an older model that wasn’t working well any longer. It stopped working in the second week of February 2020. Tried it on our other TVs in the house and doesn’t work with those either. Tried new batteries to no avail. Internet in the house is fine. WiFi is fine. The Roku won’t connect to the internet and the remote doesn’t seem to work any longer.

  REMOTE DOES NOT WORK :( :(I'm extremely disappointed.  Due to work schedules i could not install the product till now (2 months after i received it)The remote is very very laggy and unpredictable to the point that i can't even enter my WiFi password.I looked up Roku troubleshooting pages and YouTube videos. No luck.I even ordered and received the *free* HDMI extender attachment from Roku to overcome HDMI interference.But, no luck.  The Roku Stick gets pretty hot (temp) and does not react to the remote in a predictable manner.Since i was beyond the returnable time for this Order, i'm stuck with it.  Really don't know what to do with this defective Product.Would really appreciate it if a replacement could be provided.

  The streaming quality and far reaching wireless range is excellent. Just keep in mind that the only Dolby Atmos content is on Vudu and just one series on Prime called Jack Ryan in Ultra 4K.I will say however, that if you are watching that series, the Dolby Atmos is not there all the time. I never had this issue with Vudu movies that state ""DOLBY ATMOS"". And yes, my stick is connected to my Onkyo receiver in the 4K compliant hdmi input.

  This is the first Roku we purchased that was the stick.  We liked the size and that it powered from the television.  With that said, every time we turned off the TV, the Roku needed to restart.  As it is much faster than the older model, we didn't mind that much.  What we do mind is that it doesn't seem to work anymore.  It is just over 2 months old, so we are annoyed to say the least.

  I have four of these...  easy to set up and stream...  no problems there.  However, the remote run the batteries down within a couple weeks.  Between the 4 I'm changing batteries out weekly.  Trying to contact customer service is like non existent.  I now have the batteries out and have them next to each remote to save the life.  What I saved in purchasing roku over another streaming stick I've more than lost that in purchasing batteries!

  Poor quality! This item stopped working in just under a year of purchase. (We don’t even watch a lot of tv.) My original Roku device prior to this one lasted me 8 years. We even just bought a replacement wireless receiver (ALREADY) and it still isn’t working properly. It turns on but won’t work even when we reset it.  It is too late to return and is put if warranty (in LESS than a year?!) I am totally disappointed.

  It streams just fine, the UI to find apps and channels is ok, but discovery is difficult and it is often very, very slow. Often when waking it up after the TV has just been turned on it either crashes or there is no sound.This was to replace a Gen1 stick for which I lost the remote; that was rock solid, this version is disappointing.

  I love the Roku. I have an Apple TV - which doesn't get Amazon. I have a Firestick too which I like but I don't like the navigation for Hulu or Amazon at all; it's hard to browse. I love the ROKU's navigation the best. I had to get a new one because old one must have been too old and was crashing and not picking up wifi well. This one has better wifi reach. And I love how the new remote controls the TV so I don't have to hunt for remotes in order to change the volume or turn the TV off. The other great thing about this is it can travel with you. Just plug it into a Hotel TV or at your in-laws and you can watch your favorites on Amazon, Hulu, Netflix and many more.

  I hate my Roku, I bought this instead of a Fire TV Stick based on online reviews. If you're considering buying this, don't. Get a Fire TV. The remote is unresponsive, I constantly lose network connection despite a strong connection. Everyone I know has this same issues. I bought an Amazon Fire TV Stick on Prime Day and I'm far happier with that. This thing is garbage. Do not buy. I cannot stress that enough.

  Roku is the best streaming device.  I’ve had a couple Firesticks and they don’t compare to the ROKU.  The remote is heads above the Firestick.  I like all of the free stuff on ROKU and the free live channels that come with it.  It’s very quick and easy to set up.  Very intuitive.

  This Roku has made my life so much easier! I only have to deal with one remote for the TV and the streaming. I had bought the top of the line brand née Apple TV and absolutely hated it. The remote was way too sensitive and would jump from one station to another just by setting it down and I sold it within two weeks. This remote is sturdy and responsive but not so sensitive that you have to handle it with kid gloves. The volume control is easy to use. If I had any complaint at all it would be that the mute button is on the side where you sometimes hit it by mistake. But honestly, that is a minor flaw. The voice recognition is only so-so but I rarely use it. I love this remote.

  Bought the Roku on after talking to a friend who had one and loved it.  I was paying almost $7 a month for a second digital converter box for a second tv in our house.  I plugged in the Roku and in less than 10 minutes I was up and streaming!  Super easy setup, great picture quality, lots of great apps.  The Roku will pay for itself in a little over 6 months - I liked it so much that I bought a second one.  Would absolutely recommend this product!

  New remote, right out of the box, won't pair!  I can't even get the pair LED to flash.  I've tried everything - removed power to stick, removed the batteries from the remote , plugged stick back into the HDMI port and re-installed batteries.  I then pushed the pair button - NOTHING!  Okay - I can still use my phone to control the Roku stick and all is good but I really bought the Streaming Stick+ so I could power up/down my TV with the  Roku remote and have voice control.  CHEAP, CHEAP remote quality - think I'll cut my losses and buy an AppleTV!!

  4k Magic.  I remember when a wifi adapter was more than twice this size and it has that and so much more.  Roku has some amazing wizards that can pack all of that tech in such a small device.  The best part is that it works so well.  Not one issue installing it and the guided install is ridiculously easy.  The price, the performance, and the cool factor make this a no brainer.  Just buy it.  Even if you already have a Roku, this one is better.OK, one complaint.  My tv didn't have enough room for the stick to plug in directly because of the shape of the back.  I had to use the flexible hdmi adapter/extender from my chromecast.  See objective.  Enjoy.

  I’ve been using a previous Roku Stick for 6 years and love it. I decided to upgrade to this model because I’m moving my WiFi router father away and wanted a better connection.

I was able to use an extra Apple extender, but such poor QC for a simple cable is worrisome.

  The stick did not work from day one. I powered it up and it flickered in and out on the screen. I was able to get through the setup and screen cleared up. But the next day it would not work and even locked up the rest of my TV. I could not change anything on the TV until I removed the firestick. It was only $17, and I already threw away the packaging, so I did not contact Amazon for a replacement. I will just buy the better stick and avoid the Lite.

There are other options on Roku, which I haven't explored much, but perhaps I will in time.

  Remite “broke” after 32 days, seems to be a common problem. Who can’t make a durable remote?! 2 days past return period.  I’ve tried everything to get it working, tons of help on line but nothing works.  I assume Roku just makes crappy remotes. Their final recommendation is download their remote app but that has to be linked every time you turn TV on.  Pain, I can’t wait until someone makes a better product so I can trash my Rokus.

  We’ve tried so many boosters & Internet options since “cutting the cord” & now  we are kicking ourselves that we didn’t make the switch to Fire Stick sooner. It was so easy to set up & using it has been even easier! 1 room has difficulty with the internet signal & we’ve had no issues since plugging in the Fire Stick

  I am so thankful to have found this product and that it works with our older flat screen TV. Many times some of the newer technologies doesn't work well with the older TVs. While our TV is only about 4-5 years old, its not a smart TV or have the latest specs desired, but we don't watch a whole lot of TV which is why I wanted the Roku as we finally cut the cord to our TV subscription to use this instead and its so amazing! the best part? It handles the power on and off, the volume up and down, and everything else!!! So grateful for such a great product! Thanks Roku!

  Bought this so I could stream spectrum upstairs in my Bedroom bought it for Christmas.  On Dec 17 2020 Roku decided to drop the spectrum app from their App Store.  Apparently Spectrum and Roku are in a pissing contest.  I guess I will go to the extra expense for the Apple TV.

  I had a previous Roku that died after 2.5 years.  That had been easy to install and use.  The new one was difficult to get connected to my TV(incomplete instructions).  Then connecting to Amazon Prime was impossible.  Amazon wants me to sign into App 1st and Roku sends me right to the activation code, which Amazon won't accept.  Between the 2, I can't watch Prime Video (that I've paid for for many years).  Customer service nonexistent for both.  I give Amazon and Roku both lowest rating possible.

  We are sending back, after having to reset the device with almost every use. For no reason it freezes. It will still control the tv and volume but the home button doesn't work- constant resets. Roku customer service is terrible, they make it difficult to find contact information and when I finally did get to a contact page after selecting from several drop down menus, it would not give me a phone number or live chat option- strictly email. I want to resolve the issue now, not days from now. So it's going back. It's too bad because I enjoy the interface and the size of remote. Just doesn't work consistently and Roku Customer Service is lacking.

  I can’t afford cable, so I decided to buy this. It’s actually really good, having the ability to play Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu, my main sources of “TV”/Entertainment. It sometimes has a lil trip up on my voice recognition, but otherwise it can pick up on my commands, especially when I only use certain channels. It allows you to personalize it to where you can choose from the dozens of channel options and the background color.It’s a bit pricey, but I believe it’s worth it.(Btw- it can play Spotify and other music streaming services)

  I actually prefer the Fire TV, but the Roku has a couple of services not available on other streaming boxes/sticks, such as access to your Ultraviolet collection through something like Vudu. It also has all the standard streaming apps you would want.Very easy install, and so far seems to actually run faster than the Roku 3 box. The remote app for controlling the Roku on your smartphone/tablet is great, as is the ability to output audio through the app.One complaint I have is that there is no Bluetooth. To get to a Bluetooth speaker, you have to use another device running the app to output audio.

  This is my second Roku and I just love this product. This is the first time I’ve ordered this product from Amazon but it came intact and ready to use. If your debating between a Fire Stick and Roku, let me tell you, after owning both there is no comparison. Purchase a Roku.

  For a pretty low price, you can turn a dumb TV into a smart TV with this thing, as long as you've got WiFi and an available HDMI port on the TV.  It's great in hotels and AirBnB's, because I'm used to watching programs at home off my DVR, where you're not a slave to the TV schedule, like you are when you're away.  This way, you can watch your own stuff on Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, etc. etc., including all the premium channels that you already pay for on your home cable or satellite TV.The power cord is pretty short.  If you're traveling with it, bring a short extension cord.

  I dont know if my remote was defective, the stick was broke, or this product sucks. I Have the old Roku with the little box and i love it, so when i bought a new 4k tv i thought it was a no brainer to get this. After setting it up I noticed that the remote wouldn't respond right. To scroll up or down I would have to hit the button like 10 times and it would move once. So I went to the back of my tv and aimed it right at it and it worked flawlessly. So I went and sat back down and it wouldn't respond again. It seams the tv blocks the signal wich pretty much makes this product useless. I either have to put out more money for the next one up or go back to fire stick.

  This was my 3rd Roku device. The other 2 are the little hockey puck type. They plug in and sit next to the TV. This one plugs into the back of the TV.The nice thing is that you can't see it.The problematic thing is that it is behind the TV. This may mess with your Wifi reception depending on location.It did install easily but  I will probably replace it with a puck type Roku when I get a chance.As far as Roku itself? Nothing better!

  Not a lot to say really. Was easy to setup, it guides you through it, and works well. Good to note though is that you will need  Alexa or similar to have the voice operated feature.There are a lot of choices as far as channels available. That takes a little bit of digging, but its easy once you get the hang of it.If there is a drawback, it is that you can be spending a lot of money if you start signing up for all those channels!

  It's ok, but my biggest issue is that there's no TV Sleep Timer. That's very disappointing. I have a sleep disorder & always relied on a timer to turn my TV off. Now my TV stays on too much. Not too happy. It has helped some with the streaming signal & it was an easy setup.

  I had an original Fire stick and then a 4k Fire stick. Wanted to stream Comcast/Xfinity and switched to Roku since they had the Xfinity streaming app available. I have to say that in my opinion it is better than the Fire sticks. Just works better and I like the interface better also. Highly recommend. I have not used the voice option so I can't comment on that.

  This was a faster stick than my others. (I have 8) Then they updated the menu system. Small Icons and menu system in the middle of screen! Not at top. I don't know who thought it out but it's bad enough that I took the new Lite Stick out of service and put the old one back in service. C'mon Amazon. At Least give us a choice on the menu to go back to the menu it came with! New GUI is confusing.

  This has been a great purchase. I don’t know why I waited so long. It works a lot faster than the apps on my “smart TV”. My TV had no HBO max or disney plus apps, so that’s what made me look at it in the first place. I haven’t tried the voice controls yet, but I’m watching tv & movies through the fire stick more than on cable now.

We really like it, and don't mind that it doesn't control the TV set.  It's a great, inexpensive option.

  This would be a good product if the remote worked. Right now I have to reboot the thing a bunch of times to get it to talk to the remote. Roku tech support took 2 days to even get back to me, and that was just to ask if I was still having the problem (and offer no actual assistance.)I really wanted to like this thing and would love to use it to finally get rid of cable TV but it's pretty useless to me so if Roku can't fix it soon for me it's going back to Amazon.

  This was an upgrade from the standard Roku Stick.  We enjoyed the Stick, and expected some improvement... but this was way better than expected.  It is very responsive and we really like how the remote includes IR support to turn off/on the TV and manage the volume.  Our TV also automatically switches inputs to the proper HDMI port when we hit the Home button on the Roku.  So, the Roku remote is now our only remote.  We can also control the Roku with our various assorted phones, smart watches, tablets, etc.

Have several times thumb on the home button and leave the program which is frustrating,  not sure at this point why a home button is needed  or its badly misplaced.  if the home key is kept at the top then place other keys between the arrows  and the home.

  I bought this because we no longer had free cable boxes provided through XFinity.  While it does work, I hate almost all of it's functionality.

  I had firestick a few years back and liked it so when I saw this firestick lite I was a little skeptical at first like ""What is a lite?"" so when I saw that it's just a control with a non volume button and saw the price, I had to get it!  It's been working great since taken out the package and I would definitely buy again.

  I was so excited to have the amazon fire stick for our living room TV as we have gotten rid of cable and our smart tv seems to stop being smart. When I get to the box (out of amazon box which was also damaged) it was damaged. Looked like it had been ran over. :(

  Returned, the picture quality was so bad.  I was hoping to cut the cord of DirecTV, but this was no alternative at all.  The regular, 'studio' channels I might live with if I had to, but any sports programming was worse than the old standard definition.

  It was very easy to install and worked very well for a year. I have a TCL Roku TV that allowed me to cut the cable cord so I bought this device to access streaming on my Sony TV. the USB stick always ran hot so I had to unplug it whenever shutting off the TV. The remote stopped working at that point even after troubleshooting as recommended. Rather than buying another remote at this time, I opted to buy the 2020 Roku Ultra which was also very easy to install and get working.

  I love the voice search option. Especially at Christmas, I didn't know which app to use to find shows like Rudolph or Frosty. A quick voice search, and it pulls up all the options, including apps which I didn't even have downloaded. This was great because we were able to watch many things for free that I would have paid for without this search function!Another unexpected perk! You can Airplay Apple products to the stick. I didn't realize it had this function when I bought it, so it was a pleasant surprise.

  I heard about Roku but had no idea how it worked. I had both major D streaming services paying a fortune for nothing. So I started investigating costs, service available, and the price was so cheap I bought one. Easy installation, connections to Netflix and Prime easy, so many movies, tv, you name IT you can stream on Roku. Roku services are FREE. I bought two more for other TVs, everything works great.  I don’t miss those high monthly premiums for bad tv.

  Overall I just kind of found this Roku stick to be boring. My biggest problem is the limited apps that I can download. It seems like every app I download is removed from the official Roku appstore after I use it for a month or two. There is no Twitch support anymore which was a big disappointment for me. I don't see Roku as being relevant anymore since the firestick is so much better.

  First Roku stick used. Easy to get going, adding all our various accounts, Netflix, Disney +, Prime, etc... works great in our projector! Ready for those backyard fires and movies on the big screen! No issues at all with wireless distance. Works everywhere through our little 1300 sq foot house.Totally recommend the Roku stick.

  Absolutely amazing - very fast, very easy to use, the interface looks fresh, the voice control is good, and the ability to cast directly to your Roku with IOT devices is pretty awesome. This was my final pick after considering Chromecast and Firestick as alternatives. I think it hits it right out of the park with quality, ease of use, features, and of course, value. Going to buy a couple of these for family members less keen on tech and using streaming devices. Perfect for mom, dad, grandparents, etc. and great for us to just snap up and on the TV with no hassle.

  Easy to set up, worked immediately.  I am however still learning how to use prime and some other channels offered. I was surprised at the charges for different channels,  like British channels and music? The streaming is great when you can keep track of what you watched last. Bought 2 for second TV but havent set that one up yet.

  Works great, faster than the TV apps. One tip - they recommend you plug this into a wall. If you do it will get warm and stay warm all the time. I haven't noticed it getting hot doing this (my brother's overheated) but if you plug it into a USB port on the TV that doesn't happen. I've noticed no difference in streaming quality either way.

  I ordered the Fire TV Stick Lite wit Alexia voice on 3/7/21- it arrived the next day!  I installed it on 3/13/21 with no problem and watched my church service the next morning.  It was easy to install even for a senior citizen.  Due to health issues I still cannot attend church- now I can watch my church service on YouTube every Sunday.  It sure beats watching on a small cell phone!  The picture and sound are really great.

  Can I rate this zero stars?  Or negative stars?  It doesn't work.  It takes 20 minutes for it to come on.  Until then it flashes like a strobe light.  I bought it to access HBO Max, which I'm paying for with my HBO account.  But, though Amazon advertised having the agreement with HBO to do this, I find no app to allow that.

  It’s a great product only thing I wish you could completely turn it off instead of sleep mode. I’ll fall sleep watching it wake up to a blank screen turn the tv off and forget about it but feel since YouTube/Netflix is open my WiFi takes a hit. Be nice to just turn it off and let it reconnect when powered back on. Other than that nothing to complain about and didn’t feel it was a big enough thing to take away a full star.

  I'm pleased with this purchase. I'm still exploring it's capabilities, but et does everything I want without any hesitation. The TV controls  ares a wonderful improvement over the firestick I had been using. It looks like it offer a bigger selection of options too. I set it for 1he 1080HD setting , as that's fine for the size of my TV. I watch so programs on Youtube that I really enjoy, and feel that it was a ""bargain"" for me.The cord for the power supply could be a little longer, but I found that the USB port on my TV works fine, so no problem.

  Had a problem setting up due to communication between the Roku unit and the remote. I didn't realize they were not getting the signal. Contact support via chat and they steered me in the right direction. They were great. If I do not have the remote in the right location it loses communication with the unit. I am learning where to hold and aim it to achieve the desired results.

  We had the first version of the Streaming Stick. This works better (power connection is stronger, features are better). Of course, you can't see any cable or satellite TV channels unless you also subscribe with a cable or satellite provider in your area. And it is a bit of a challenge to avoid all commercials, but the total cost of Netflix and Hulu, the main non-commercial streaming channels, is only a fraction of what cable and satellite companies charge for programming that mostly has commercials!

  It was working fine until this week when it refuses to connect to the WiFi network that it has worked on for years.  And the signal quality is all bars - excellent.  No other device on that network have problems.  I've restarted and powered off with no luck.  It sees the network, it just won't connect to the network.I'm contacting Roku support.  It's been less than a year so according to the warranty it should be covered.  But I've not seen anything positive about their customer care.  I'll update with my experience.I've rated this 2 stars because I have another one that hasn't lost it's mind yet. So there is that.

  There are several problems with the Roku unit. First, we have had multiple times where we get an overheating message. Secondly, there is a significant lag before the remote is able to communicate with the stick. You will push on the buttons and nothing will happen. Finally, and most vexingly, the stick will declare that it cannot work with the TV---unplug it and see if that works. This will usually work, but not always. With our set-up, it is a significant pain.I would like to give the unit a better score. The remote is well laid out, the menus are intuitive, and the overall package, when working, is very nice. In general, though, it has become an object of ridicule within our family with questions of, ""Why do we have to use the Roku again?"" (Chromecast is not supported by Amazon.)If it works for you, it is a nice unit. We have had continuing problems with it and I would not recommend to friends.

  We picked up a non-smart TV (Emerson) and wanted to find a device to give us web connected content without a lot of fus or compatability issues. This Roku stick has really been a fantastic tool and I highly recommend it if you are wanting to add some additional functionality to your TV.

  I got this for my mom-in-law.  I like that it can control the TV (power on/off and sound) with one remote, but the voice command wasn't very useful.  We're streaming multiple Roku channels and it seems it just finds Roku channels, not the channels or shows within a channel.  Even when I asked it to play the Frndly channel (my mom likes Hallmark), it kept wanting to go to another Roku channel.

  Solid device with a set up time of under 15 minutes. I wanted to get my mother a device that functions simply for all her streaming needs. The device tunes itself to be perfectly formatted to your tv upon setup so everything looks it’s best right away, even worked on my 12 year old Toshiba. The remote is easy with few buttons that feel great to press. Still no HBO Max app but it could be coming soon.

  We upgraded our old Roku device for this one. We had a very old Roku stick (maybe 1st generation) and the wifi connectivity wasn't great. There is absolutely a huge difference changing to this stick. It is so much faster, probably triple or quadruple the speed of the older model we had. I also love that it comes with a power button and volume control. If your Roku is slow and you're wondering if it's worth getting a newer model, I would say it definitely is!

  Everything about the roku stick is great...Streaming, picture quality, user interface but that stupid remote always seems to have issues pairing or actually working. We've only had this device for a year and a half and the remote constantly has been unpairing or just not working altogether even with new batteries. These issues really started to manifest themselves about a year in.When it does work it works awesome, I can pretty much do anything from any part of our living room and the fact in controls the TV power functionality is great. We have our TV mounted and it sits behind the TV out of eye sight. If Roku could just make sure the remote was more reliable this thing would be a 5 star.Considering the fire stick or apple tv as a replacement now just because of the remote's unpredictability.

  
"

  Everything works well, and so do most channels. ROKU ought to monitor the channel offerings periodically to insure they work as advertised. For example MLB.TV apparently does not at this time. However Netflix, VUDU, and the channels I use all work extremely well, and, when the content allows, the 4K HDR 60fps is brilliant. The device itself deserves five stars, but ... Customer support is dismal.Update: Contacted Customer Support again and this time the support was excellent. No BS, no did you plug it in? type questions. Just straight forward answers to straight forward questions.

  This is a marked improvement from the old Roku I had. It picks up wifi perfectly (it's got some kind of small booster in the line behind the  TV) and I love that you don't have to point the remote right at a receiver for it to work like you do on others. Also the remote controls TV volume and power now which is especially outstanding if, like me, you watch mostly Roku in a room and therefore don't need to change the input very often. I definitely recommend it.

  All is great, except it gets pretty hot. One TV we used it on didn’t cool as well as the others, and we ended up getting a high heat warning and the thing was very hot to the touch.

  Cut the cable and my big smart tv wasn’t smart enough. This did the trick. I left Dish and now just stream with this, Netflix and youtube tv with dvd cloud. Happy I didn’t need to buy new tv’s. Have one in the living room and basement family room. I get a strong wifi signal with this one. Worth a fee bucks extra. The remote is all I need to turn the tv on and operate everything. The voice doesn’t always understand me but we are working on that. Love that I got rid of the cord mess. Plugs into the HDMI and USB ports.

  We purchased a second Roku streaming stick + in February, set it up and did not start to use it until 2 weeks ago. It will heat up after 15 minutes of use to over 113c. We notified Roku and they sent us a wifi extender. received that last week. Same thing, heats up and unable to use after 15 minutes. Notified Roku, they advised the stick was under warranty and we needed to return it at our expense to receive a new one. No problem, its been 4 days now and they have not emailed a return label or responded to our emails on an address to mail it to.. The window to return it back to Amazon has expired. No one is manning the phones. Its difficult to get anything resolved during these trying times. Stay Safe everyone.

  Really good product. Had a little trouble with Roku customer service initially. The extension cable for the A/C adapter was defective; it would lose power randomly. After diagnosing there was nothing wrong with the product itself I attempted to procure a replacement cable from Roku. The customer representative wanted me to send the entire unit back to Roku and they would send me a replacement unit. When I insisted that I only needed the cable and not the whole unit replace I was told I had to send the whole unit back which was frustrating. Ended up keeping everything and just throwing the cable away. No problems to date since. Makes it a lot nicer to stream on our tv instead of a computer. There are a lot of apps available for different channels. One thing that is frustrating though is there is no antenna app built into the streaming stick. It seems that you have to buy a roku tv to have the functionality of not switching between an hdmi connection and tv itself. Also I have noticed that you cannot just turn off the roku stick itself. I've found that the stick creates some kind of interference that will block over the air reception. Often we have to unplug the power to Roku stick to get the over air reception to our tv. While a little annoying it doesn't outweigh the overall good things the streaming stick bring to our television experience. If your looking for something to use streaming services to your tv and have the ability to add other things down the road like stereo hookup or portability this is a great buy.

  I bought the Roku specifically because I wanted to stream Disney+. And I have to say it does not disappoint. It is very user friendly, you can even control things from your computer--makes downloading different services a lot easier and quicker. Only downfall for me is the voice recognition doesn't seem to work very well, basically not at all. But that's a minor thing that doesn't particularly bother me. I would totally recommend this item if you are on the fence about it.

  The setup and activation were easy, it just took far longer than I thought it should. But then I have a lot of channels on my Roku account.My only issue is that I get an onscreen overheating message. It is plugged into an HDMI auto switch on top of my media cabinet. Not anywhere near another heat source. I finally moved the switch over so that the ROKU was sticking out in the air off the edge of the cabinet. That seems to have mostly stopped the messages. The previous HD ROKU stick was also very hot. They need to put cooling fins in the outer case. If this issue continues I will probably stick a heatsink on it.

  So much better than a roku box.!!  I really like the microphone that's on the remote control. Really like the web browser too!! So easy to use and set up.  I'm so glad I ordered this!!

  I connected it to my television.  It asked for my wifi password and then synced.  It then said that it needed to do a software update.  After that, it will no longer sync.  I've had it for a week and haven't been able to use it even after trying all of the troubleshooting tips.

  Received.... went to set up and it did the software updates, show the ""firetv"" symbol and went black. Called amazon and there is not technical support for this at all.... it was you send back to receive refund or we will send a replace and you have to send this back. I bought one before this and it lasted 6 months before it would come on and then go off then go and come back on. At 6 months its passed the return date. Totally unhappy!

  The manual said it came with a usb cable for power. The wall adapter was in the box but there was no cord. How do you forget the power cord? What's funny is even though there was no 2$ usb cable that should have been there, there was two fire sticks in the box instead of one. Jokes on you amazon I got a drawer full of cords! But seriously it was pretty annoying.

  Didn't research enough as to why it's the ""lite"" version of a normal firestick. Didn't like that you still need the tv control to turn on/off and change the volume. Otherwise, its similar to the ""normal"" firestick"".

  This Roku Stick with voice remote is the best device of 5 I've purchased over the years. It is faster and works well for streaming phone content to my TV. I got it on sale and, in hindsight, I should have purchased 2 or 3.This one allows adding the Xfinity Stream app. That app, however, doesn't allow functions like pause, rewind, etc but that's not the fault of Roku.

  
"

  Its a great product, easy setup and lots of channels to choose.  What I didn't like is Roku is a menu driven operating system where some channels are aggregates of many channels, such as Xfinity Streaming having over 500! The only way to get to channel 266 is to scroll to it.  Not terrible, but if I had one wish for the remote designers, I'd ask for a number pad.  Forget the fast keys to dedicated channels, that's a waste.  Overall, I'm still super happy with product.

  One, the remote will not turn on or off the TV and it has been. I can turn the TV on with the TV remote and get to the Roku page but I cannot go to any channel or any other feature. Amazon says it is beyond the time for return and I am stuck with a Roku that does not work.Update, embarrassing, batteries were bad in the remote.

  The remote control doesn't work anymore. Right about the time my return date expired is when it stopped working. It's so frustrating to have something that you depend on to watch TV with and it doesn't work. I've replaced the batteries I've done everything I could think of doing to get it to work and it still won't work. I can't send the remote control back because the time frame to send it back has expired. I honestly can't recommend anyone buy this product because of the remote control issue. You can't use the Roku without the remote control.

  I am very pleased with the streaming service options and the picture quality. Recently cut the cord  and this is a great way to consolidate all of the streaming services onto one platform for access individually. The voice recognition seems to work pretty well. I am happy with the purchase and ease of set up.

  Took a few minutes to setup, went off without a hitch. Very snappy and responsive. There is no calling to activate your roku device like you may see in some reviews, those people are *ahem* not suitably equipped to deal with the real world.The only complaint I can really lodge against it us how many different models there are to choose from, it's crazy.

  We have a Roku upstairs and our lower level tv never got used because it needed to be rewired for our new service so we only could use it for games or dvds.  We ordered this and our son was able to just hook it in and start watching. I wish we would have bought this sooner!

  Full menu of apps (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Disney+, etc.), tons of free TV shows and movies, compatible with our Google Home. Would have given it a 5 except for 2 things: it doesn’t work with our sound system so we have to use the TV’s speakers, and it gets very hot. But it’s a really great value for the money.

  Had it for just over a year and  four months and suddenly it stopped working. Can’t seem to get the roku remote or app remote to pair with the Roku stick. I even unplugged the darn thing for a day and still I got the same screen after it boots up”pair your remote”. This is usually an easy fix for me because I’ll usually unplug the power cord for a few minutes and replace the batteries with new ones. Looks like $60 down the garbage.

  Did ok for about a month but after that things went downhill FAST. Doesn't connect, video freezes up every 2-5 seconds, error messages around network connection are nonstop. Meanwhile all the other devices in the house are absolutely fine, network strength is fine, everything is working as it should except the roku. Not sure if we just got a defective one but overall impression is very bad.

  This roku was better then I thought it would be.  I got it on sale over the holidays and couldn't be more impressed.  I have always been a fan of the user interface which makes things very easy.  The setup took less than 10 minutes as well!  The remote with voice recognition was a sweet surprise and works extremely well!  Picture looks great and there is no lag in watching shows.

  I have been with Roku since their very first Roku box that was the size of 5 CD cases stacked on each other.  I liked the offering then, and I really like the Stick+.  The Stick+ is fast, easy to setup and use.  The only beef that I have is not the item itself but rather one of the Roku Channels, the Media player channel (Or App.  However you want to look at it.).  I wished it played more media formats than it does, but it's a very minor thing.  Overall the thing works great.

  You have to give them your DOB (why????) And a credit card (why .??) To get it set up.  If you have a smart TV, you do not need this.  This turns a TV into a smart TV.  Not sure that the so called free channels have much content that is not readily available elsewhere.  Voice works well.  You have to set up almost every channel you want to watch and link each channel to you home internet provider. But once setup, works well

  This streaming device knocks the Amazon fire stick out of the water. The picture quality is so much better and most importantly it does not drop the wireless connection every time you change a channel.  The set up was easy, anyone could do it. Highly recommend and will be buying more.

  I bought this product on May 20,2018 and have had it on TV since. It worked great until 10/8/18 when remote would not control the on/off/volume. I called Roku and they sent me another remote but it didn't work either. I continued using the remote without those features working. Recently another problem with Roku arrived. The unit will not connect to Spectrum unless I unplug the power cord and reboot it. Sometimes this takes several tries. This unit is very frustrating and I doubt I will buy another.

  Very easy to set up.  Screens are easy to customize.  Have not tried voice or Alexa.Minor irritation: the volume and mute buttons are on the side so I find myself frequently hitting them when I grip the remote.If I could change a feature I would allow for the headsets to work AND the TV volume to stay one so those of us who don’t hear as well can enjoy the show while others can hear it on TV...just sayingOne thing though...pay attention  to the price, I bought it for $59 and a week later it was $49.  Fortunately, Amazon is good about stuff like this and I was able to swap purchases.

  I've had a TV for years that I never really used, I always watched TV on my laptop or iPad. But this Roku makes it so I can watch TV on an actual TV! It linked all my apps (Hulu, Netflix, prime) in one place where I can easily watch. The only thing that didn't work with the Roku is volume control, but my TV (Westinghouse) is a weird brand I guess. But all other features are working, including voice control. Definitely worth the purchase in my opinion.

  Set easy and wifi connection simple.  Roku streaming device worked so well that I bought a second one for another TV.  Also dropped Comcast to basic on one TV and eliminated it on another as there are so many streaming channels that I hardly every us cable except for some live news reports.  Great to watch movies and TV shows, especially PBS.

  The first Roku Streaming Stick+ would not connect. A replacement was provided fairly quickly and installed easily.There's a bit of setup involved in connecting to subscription services, but as long as you have your passwords available, the process is straightforward and menu-driven.Navigating through other setup aspects, such as changing the order of channels, is not intuitive. Once the instructions are reviewed on Roku's website, the changes were pretty easy.I deducted one star because Roku support is email or community only, so effectively non-existent for any unusual issues, such as I experienced with my first Roku.

  Worked great with the items included in the package until this evening. it just so conveniently stops working after the 30 days are up to try to exchange or return. i try to call both roku and amazon help line and can't get thru. What a waste of money! Purchased 7/9/19 and quit working today, 8/13/19. Edit*** husband found out that it isn't getting power. when plugged directly into tv thru another hdmi port it works. So boils down to a faulty adapter plug or chord. Sucks that it is taking up a hdmi port that i could use for another device.

  This is the best Roku I've ever owned, and the first one I am pretty much completely happy with. The new power/volume buttons on the remote control are a game changer, it means you can put your old remotes away and do it all with Roku now. This unit is also much faster and more responsive than the previous generations. They had to really improve processor speed and memory to make sure it could handle 4k video. It also seems to have a much more reliable wifi connection, the one furthest away from my router has no problems streaming high definition content, unlike my old rokus.  I also love that you can plug the USB into the back of the TV and so don't need to use an outlet or have anything visibly connected to the TV. It's completely invisible.

  The remote stopped working 1.5 years after purchase. I tried all sorts of fixes from roku's webpage and didn't work. I downloaded roku app but my phone can't find the device, even though both devices are connected to the same internet signal. My last option is to buy another remote but I haven't decided if I really want to spend more money on it. I like roku better than Fire Stick but after a few years, my fire stick is still working with minor incidents here and there.

  Very happy with this device. It was the only device that gave me HDR with Dolby Digital 5.1 with Netflix, and Vudu with my Sony X900e  and Sonos 5.1 set up (Beam with ARC connected).  No need for any high speed HDMI cables, and able to cut down on wire clutter by having it powered by USB port right on my TV.  (Very little lag when waking)Previously, was using an Apple TV 4k which was spotty between needing the correct high speed HDMI cable, and most Itunes HDR movies only available in Dolby Vision ( not supported by the Sony 900e). The 900E built in apps did not allow me to get HDR  picture either (Have to cast from your phone to the TV)Highly recommended.

  The Roku Streaming Stick + is almost perfect!  This is my 6th Roku device. It is certainly the best. The install went very well. It correctly paired the power and volume controls with my old 32"" Samsung TV.The HDMI1 port on my TV sticks straight out the back of the TV. If I hadn't ordered the free HDMI EXTENDER from Roku, the TV wouldn't have fit close to the wall. I advise everyone to order the extender. This stick is so long, it likely would not fit the main HDMI port on many TVs without the extender. It should be included in the box. Took about a week to receive after I ordered it from Roku.I used the included power adapter rather than take a chance with my TV's USB port. Many TVs were designed not to deliver enough power from the USB port.The power and volume controls on the remote work great on my TV.The WiFi reception is very good.So far, I am very pleased with the Roku Streaming Stick +!UPDATE: I have bought a 2nd Stick+ and use it on a 39” Element TV powered by the TV’s USB port. When TV is first turned on, the TV frequently doesn’t have sound. To get sound, the TV must be repeatedly turned off and on until sound returns. Problem may be caused by the Roku being plugged into HDMI 3.

  Barely 5 months in and it continuously dropped the pairing between remote and stick, and now the remote has stopped working completely. I've had reset and paired the remote 6 times in the past 2 days and today it just stopped working. And there is no way to contact seller/support via Amazon?

  Another useless product.  Could not pair the remote.  After a search online, looks like this is a common problem.

  I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this stick.  I too, ran into a problem in activating the stick and called the number shown on the screen and was told by someone that I had to choose a ""package"" and pay a one time fee to activate it.  What a bait and switch.  Nothing in the description states there will be a charge to activate this service.  It should be written on the packaging and in the description for Amazon!  I'm returning the stick and won't consider anything from ROKU again.

  We bought this Roku stick to stream a channel we didn't otherwise get. Every time we try to use the stick, we have to unplug it, wait 10 seconds, and plug it back in. We have had other Roku boxes that work find and do not require a constant reset. I'd personally NOT purchase this item again.

  I've been using this ROKU since Jan and all of a sudden it started saying no input found. I would unplug and set back up. Now it just plays sounds,  says my HDMI cord (which I don't have.. it plugs directly into HDMI port) may be bad and is not 4k compatible. That's the main reason I bought this one. And I've tried YouTube and Google to correct issue with no luck.

  The roku stick itself is very easy to set up and use.  However the remote batteries die every few days.  This has become quite expensive to use with the battery issue. We have started leaving the batteries out until we need to use it (even while watching TV we remove the battery until we need to adjust volume). I bought two of the kits and both have the same issue so it does not seem to be a defect. Very disappointed with the battery issue

  This is my 3rd Roku device that I've owned over the years.  I started with the first gen a decade ago and now this.  This unit is replacing my Amazon Fire TV due to quality issues that was having.  This is my first streaming device that I'm using with wifi as I've always made a point to use an Ethernet cable for the best connection.  Setup was simple as usual and it connected to my 5ghz wifi with no issues.  I've been using it for a while now with absolutely no problems whatsoever.

  This used to be a device that you bought, you downloaded your services, and you streamed. You were the customer. Not any more. Now you buy the device, but you can only stream from services that Roku can monetize you with, either by taking a share of the advertising, forcing the service to integrate into and/or provide content for, the Roku Channel, or letting Roku take some of the service’s ads. You are now the product, not the customer. So if a service doesn’t cave to Roku’s demands, you can’t watch that service on Roku and need to buy an additional, neutral, streaming solution that let’s you watch your content.  Not cool.

  I gave up on my Apple TV box, which was (I think) 4th generation. The remote was awful. In comparison, this Roku stick is a pleasure to use (and a third of the price of the stupid Apple box). Easy navigation. Voice commands work quite well. Recommended.

  We RV and just bought a new 5th wheel.  It did not come with a smart tv like our previous trailer.  I did research and Roku was most recommended streaming stick.  This was the best price and arrived new in box in the time estimated.  I am very happy to have tv reception again.  Great product!

  Fairly easy to set up.  Mostly intuitive.  Do not use the voice recognition very much.  So far, seamless streaming with the Roku stick.  Content far exceeds what we had available through satellite television.  The monthly savings from switching from satellite tv to our Roku stick has enabled us to purchase a new tv and we are thrilled.  Can’t say enough good things about Roku.  If you can, cut the cord and go internet through Roku

  Came with a great remote that can control my panasonic TV; a must for me.  It is a lot more responsive than my old prime stick.  If you like the more expensive Ultra, get this one for cheaper.  Not comparable in performance with Ultra, but definitely will suffice

  Love it. It gave me stranger things!!!!! And X-Files. I loyX-Files. Special Agent Scilly is my first big girl crush, so it has a special place in my heart. And 11 just flat out rocks. Anyway, back to the device....Very easy set up. Great quality. No lag or interface differences from the roku box. I’m blind so I really appreciate the voice input search feature. Get it, you know you want to.... yeah!!!! Do it, Doug!!!!!!

  The Fire TV Stick Lite works perfect for our ""non-smart"" TV. The only difference compared to the regular Fire Stick is that you cannot control the volume and cannot shut the TV off with the remote. We don't even notice the difference to be honest. I would recommend especially if you're not ready to upgrade your TV.

  We upgraded our Fire Stick because our original version was slower than slo-mo videos. This version is super fast and user friendly.  However, one of the reasons we upgraded was to stream Apple TV.  It does not stream Apple TV - even though it has the Apple TV log on the packaging.  Google searches told us that this version has not received the upgrade in order to stream it - but it's likely coming.  So we are back to watching it on our iPads for now.

  Having a problem with the install. Wont work without going thru the blu-ray player... As a stand alone product this is unnecessary. This was going to be used instead of the blu-ray.

  This went to upgrade our projector with ROKU capabilities, but the bonus of the RF remote working while this is plugged in behind our receiver is excellent. We have a ROKU capable TV and this seems significantly more responsive than the TV remote itself.

  There was not enough space on the back of my TV and where my HDMI port is to plug in the HDMI Stick (the stick is too long).Its obviously an issue since ROKU offers a free ""HDMI extender"" and they note it in the set up guide.Its also an ongoing issue since its all over Youtube (I should have looked there before ordering).Bottom line is ROKU should include it in the package as a ""just in case you need it"" or at the very least put a warning up to measure the space available on the back of your TV.

  I couldn't love this more. We had two Roku TV's upstairs that were so cool we bought the streaming stick for our family room & finally cut the cord on our cable. ZERO regrets!

  Besides being delivered to the wrong apartment, the actual set up was super easy! This device brings ALL of my streaming services together & includes the movies/tv shows i bought from Itunes. Its so nice to have them all in once place. If i had one issue, it seems there can be a random lag & the quality of youtube video is not the best. But overall, this is definitely worth it!

  I have two of these and they are pretty excellent streaming sticks. Roku seems to have good support and there are an amazing number of 'channels' that can be added. Performance is great, most of the channel apps launch quickly (but some are slower than others). Only issue I've had is one of the devices had issues with the remote 'disconnecting'. Roku support recommended the HDMI extension to solve the problem - sounded like hooey to me, but it did resolve the issue. While not as cheap as some other streaming options, I have zero regrets.

  The roku is not all free streaming! There are add on apps that you have to subscribe to. Also much of the free content is old or movies even God has not heard of. The remote looses its interface very frequently so you have no control of the TV or Roku. Also BEWARE!!!! There are some Roku sites on the internet to help you set up RoKu for a FEE. FAKE sites!!!! If you need to contact Roku all of their help is FREE! Be forewarned!

  The unit works with the ROKU app on my iPhone. However the remote control  interaction with the streaming stick is quite unreliable.  Almost daily I have to remove the batteries from the remote and execute the steps to pair the unit with the remote. Sometimes this works the first time but often it takes more than 2 tries to reestablish the connection. I am returning the device.  I had the same problem with a ROKU 4 unit.

  This is a great product at a great price. But beware of two things:1.  The dedicated app keys on the remote are: Netflix/Hulu/ESPN/Sling.  This does not match the picture which has HBO NOW and Prime.....major disappointment.2.  Streaming Sticks do NOT work with OEM remotes that combine Roku keys with programmable TV/Sound bar keys into one single remote.

  It’s a pretty great product, but I got it for hotel travel and I struggle to get the Roku to connect to most hotel wifi.

  After trying different projects, Roku by far has been the best experience.  Setup was easy, and the wizard even how's through programming the remote with my tv.  I did not have to look up codes or anything. Roku also has all the applications that I needed, YouTube, YouTube TV, Netflix, Amazon prime video, sling, direct TV now, HBO go, Starz, showtime...  and many more.The device is fast there is almost no wait to open applications or even to start.For a cord cutter, this is the device I would recommend.

  Great product. I have used Roku for years, but this model is excellent. I was concerned at first that it may have difficulty with bandwidth for streaming, but it works perfectly. The remote control is a big differentiator, it not only pairs wirelessly (Not vie IR, Infrared) that allows control of the Roku without line of sight, but i also has an IR transmitter to allow control of the TV to turn on/off and volume control. So now I only need one remote control. It is fast to respond and was very easy to set up with many fine tuning features and options.

  The device works as intended - the only issue I have is that the remote feels very cheaply made and every time I depress the circle buttons I can hear the plastic shifting, especially the cover for the batteries.

  It’s so much better than the build-in Android TV system of my TV! It’s so easy to assemble and you don’t need to read a thick manual to know how to use it, it’s almost happened spontaneously. I love the app “downloader” in this fire tv stick that allows me to download and install those apps I want. The lite stick is enough for me cuz I don’t need 4K and Alexa voice controls. Everything so far is pretty good.

  I wanted to get a Roku for 4K/HDR streaming. Picked the wrong one at first and returned it. This one works very well with my system.

  I have two of these attached to older TVs (Vizio and HP) to use with the Spectrum app. The Roku was able to detect the TV type and set the remote to be able to turn the TV on/off and adjust the volume for both TVs.

  I have to pair the ""enhanced remote"" at least twice a day, which requires power cycling the roku, which needless to say is a PIA.

Since it's an issue that happens intermittently Roku isn't being very helpful.  I would buy an Amazon Fire instead.

  Although it does pretty much as advertised and is tons faster than our old Roku device, there have been a few minor issues that have led to restarting the device one or more times a week. These seem to be variations on a theme: Maintaining good Wi-Fi communication. Usually that is fine, but sometimes sound noticeably lags picture. On occasion a channel cannot be reached or we are told we do not have a subscription to it. Again restart fixes. So, though a big oimprovement over earlier, we do have inconveniences, some likely peculiar to our specific environment.

  This is plugged into our receiver and it has performed very well. This is placed too far to use 5.0 signal, but the 2.4 provides 20+ Mbps on our wireless WiFi. using 2.4 channels with no buffering or pauses. Voice is good but not as robust as Comcast's version. Highly recommended.

  I'm very biased about this.  The video quality is very very good but the interface sucks.  Roku really needs to redesign it's software interface.  Also, I use a HDHomeRun Over the Air TV tuner and it is not natively compatible with Roku.  I have to use software such as Plex to transcode the signal for the Roku wich degrades the picture quality. I also have an AppleTV and I find the experience with it to be much better.  The Roku is used in a room that doesn't get much use and it was a far cheaper alternative to the AppleTV.

  Using the USB power in the rear of the TV seemed like such a great idea as I would have one less wire that I needed to hide.  But I noticed that I was having issues with the remote and it pairing with the device and/or working at all or lagging a lot.  After unplugging a few times I got the Low Power screen that lead me to try the old fashion plug.  Once I changed to the power source everything worked great.  I suggest that if you have a TV that is more than a few years old don’t bother with the USB power source.

  My Roku Streaming Stick has a problem. Most of the time when commanded to move left/right or up/down nothing happens for 20 to 30 seconds, also there is a message that appears in the upper right corner of the TV screen ""Remote Control"".  I have  made many attempts to talk to Roku Support about the problem. The best they have to offer is extreamly long hold times or a connection to a person barely able to speak English and only able to provide the basic setup procedure. I have four Roku's and if it was not for this problem I would have never known how difficult it is to get help from Roku product support.

  Came late( it got lost ) but Amazon shipped out a new one and it works great so far. Decided to get this one since my TV is wall mounted and my other Roku required a shelf. I like that this one comes with a remote that allows you to turn up and down the volume, unlike my other Roku .

  Like many others have said before. Roku has an unresolved issue of the batteries being drained by the remote control.  Needed to change batteries after 1 week and contact support.

  Roku devices are great alternatives to expensive satellite or cable packages.  The stick is a nice clutter-free option.  I had 2 older sticks (3500 & 3600 that were getting very slow.  I bought 2 of the Stick+ to replace them.  Just read the clear directions, and installation/setup is very easy and mostly automated.  This remote also controls TV power and volume, which is very convenient.  I'm very pleased with Roku hardware and software.

  Ordered a ROKU+ about 6 months ago, worked fine for about 4 months when it began to require constant resetting to keep it operating. According to ROKU, it was a defective unit, and of course, out of warranty. Ordered a replacement, and right out of the box, the remote was defective, having some buttons that were totally non-functional and others that required a lot of pressure to operate. So, I wound up with one ROKU+ that had a defective streaming stick, and another that had a defective remote. I took the remote from the first unit and paired it to the second stick - everything now works like it should have in the first place! So, major problems in 2 out of 2 units! All I can say is, buyer beware! Bad QC? Made in China? How about all of the above?

  The only issue with this was powering it. The USB on the TV did not provide enough power to consistently power the stick. I had to use the included adaptor and USB extension cord. Easy setup, one remote use (used to have two, one for the BluRay player and one for the TV). Happy with this and will not be going back to connecting through the BluRay player.

  I already have 2 ROKU Ultra's for our home tv's. Preferred the Ultra for home use so I can connect hardwired to my ethernet wall outlets.

  Roku is better.  This seems to go to sleep and I keep having to unplug it to reset it because it won't wake up.  When I reset it, many times the sound doesn't work so I have to reset it a couple more times.  Tried it out for a couple weeks.  Decided to return it.  I'm often never happy with Amazon made products.  Go with the Roku.

  We have an older smart TV (2014) that doesn’t allow us to download certain streaming apps such as Disney plus. The fire stick is the perfect device to resolve this issue.

  Purchased to install on my late model LG tv. Easy to install and setup was as simple as can be. My main reason for purchasing was to use the Spectrum app to view Spectrum channels. Using the Roku stick you don’t need to rent a box from Spectrum. It’s definitely a money saver. And, I was able to log into my Amazon Prime account to view other movies and shows. The Roku stick is a great investment. The voice remote feature is great but You will need to spend a little time learning how to access various features with the remote, i.e full guide, previous channel, watch list, etc. overall I highly recommend this product.

  Love this! I chose to ditch the dish for the Roku stick and am glad I did. I’m saving a lot more money (paying about $50/month vs $200). If you’re used to cable, dish, etc is harder to just scan and find something to put the tv on because searching is done differently. But there are more shows/movies to choose from so it’s really a lot better!

  The remote stopped working in less than 3 months.When the app goes to sleep and you try to wake it up, it automatically starts loading a new app or channel randomly.

  Our Roku worked just fine for two months. We even liked it but now it locks up. Roku only warranties it for 30 days. Of course, Amazon can't do more than that. We're out $50. Shoulda bought the Protection Plan. Next time I'll know better.Be careful with calling Customer Support. There's some kind of a hack in their system and we talked to someone who wanted to charge $45 annual service. At least the Roku website says there's no charge for service. Not that anyone was available to talk us through whatever the heck the problems is.

  Since the stick is 3 3/4"" long and is intended to be portable I was surprised to find that an HDMI extender isn't included in the box. The extender is free but you have order it online then wait to get it by snail mail. Seems a little cheap to me.

  Roku is always awesome and this version is ever better. Replaced my 4k Apple TV.I just did not like having to look at the Apple TV black box. This Roku stick is nicely tucked away, and operates my TV and volume. Works great for my entire family.

  The Roku user interface is great but unfortunately the streaming stick does not always work. It frequently cuts out in the middle of streaming and goes back to the loading page for several minutes. I have been emailing with Roku customer service for months and none of their troubleshooting directions have worked so I have to assume something is wrong with the hardware itself.

  Works great, we now have 2. No cable bill, just Prime & have used Netflix, but now have Sling. U cant beat this, all u need is internet & u get plenty of channels. People on foodstamps can get discounted Prime $5.99 & internet $9.99 (or low income as well) so works great for low bills.

  I was already looking to purchase a new larger TV for a bunch more $$$.  Then I decided to try the Roku.  My only problem was deciding on which of the 30 or so models.  I decided to go with this -$70 model and couldn't be happier.  It has saved me close to $700 since I was only going to purchase the new TV to gain some of the new features that my eight year old one doesn't have.  For over a $600 price difference, I think I can live with what I have for a few more years!

  This thing is worth every penny. I have a Roku Smart TV and Apple TV. I love them both but I needed something else for a tv that didn’t have anything. This really has it all. If your looking for a cheaper alternative for smart tv or Apple TV this is what you want. It’s fast, it has all the apps you need. And what’s most important to me, I can mirror my phone to the tv. Pictures, videos, movies.Plug it in. Set up. Log in and your set!

  I bought this Roku then my husband became ill and I never got to properly install it. It is 9 months later and today I I spent hours trying to get it to recognize my Wifi. I  called Roku and the contract people they hired to troubleshoot it, asked for $69.99 to help me! Outrageous!! I called my cable provider who talked me through lots of tries and ended with a factory reset. All was to no avail. I cannot connect to the internet. What am I to do with this? I think it's awful that the best Roku can do is send you to a number that wants 70$ to talk about your problem.

  The remote stopped working after 3 weeks.  Amazon kindly credited me the amount for a new remote and I ordered it.  The new remote will not pair (light should flash but it doesn't) and roku has been searching for the remote for over 30 minutes now.  I only gave 2 start since I can use my tablet to control the screen but that is not convenient.

  I let the roku pair to my TV and my volume on my TV dropped to the point where I had to turn the volume up 5x normal to hear my network channels.  The roku channels were then way too loud.  Apparently this is a common complaint about this roku device.  I sent it back and got another fire stick.  That didn't mess with the volume when I hooked up my old one.

  The way the four HDMI ports are oriented and recessed into the back of my Samsung TV the stick is about a half inch too long to insert into the HDMI port. So I am using an Amazon Firestick adapter to make it work. Roku should include one in the box for the stick version. I found that I can go to the Roku website and place an order for a free adapter. Roku should have included one in the box.

  I've had this Roku stick for almost a year, and am still pleased with it.  Easy to install, just plug it into the tv's port.  The remote is simple to use (I like the quick-access buttons for Disney Plus and Netflix).  I really like that I can remove it from my regular tv and use it in a different tv/location.

  I loved the Roku streaming stick+ because of the 4K HDR capabilities, its very compact, and I dont need internet or wifi to stream anything from my phone, so I can download all the content I need on my phone and stream it on the Roku when on holiday, the only bad part is,  I am from Mexico and Roku Mexico has very limited access to some channels, I have Amazon prime here but Roku does not support Amazon in Mexico, or Fox etc, The two things that it does supports is Netflix and Youtube in 4k and HDR an with that I am happy.

  I was skeptical because there were no on/off tv controls in this version.  I put it on a tv that I was close enough to not need it and I have no issues with it.  Just as good as the regular firestick!!!  If you could wait I would but it when they have their special sales because right after I paid $29.99 it was on for Amazon Birthday sale for $17.99.  Other than that I love it!!!

  Roku user since 2010.  Been using Fire Stick Lite since release.  Fire Stick remote is alot more responsive and you don't have to point it directly at the dongle.  The only thing I don't like is the small amount of memory and the amount of preloaded Amazon apps installed that can't be removed which takes away memory and takes up some cache.  Otherwise love both of my Fire Sticks.

  When it works, it's great.  But you never know when you turn on the tv if there will be sound.  Have to unplug the fire stick from the tv and the connection.  Wait.  Then connect it all, turn on the tv and usually sound is back.  Had it for a month and have had to do this 3 times.  Read how other people have this problem.  Had my original fire stick for many years.  Never had this problem with it.

  This is simply not a good product. The remotes are incredibly spotty and the sound has gone out on the Roku we purchased.

  I love it, it is easy to use and very fast, it works great on any tv (even when it is a ghost brand TV, it works well). If you have a recognized brand it will allow you to control the volume with the remote control of Roku, but well the tv remote control has to be used for the volume.

  I bought this a couple months ago so now it's outside when I can return. I didn't hook it up until the start of the COVID-19 quarantine and was excited to have something I could use during that time. Unfortunately, the second time I used it, the remote wouldn't sync and I had to do a series of steps I looked up online involving taking out a battery and pushing three buttons at once, etc.  It's ridiculous. I've had to do that every time I've used it since. Needless to say, it's not what I had in mind for convenience and I'm never really sure if it's going to work at all the next time I want to use it. Unhappy is putting it mildly.

  This is our third Roku device and I had no problem activating it. We had a Roku 2 in 2011, and an upgraded Roku 2 in 2015. The streaming stick works so much faster than our previous Roku at a fraction of the price! So happy we upgraded.

  This was a replacement for my old Roku streaming stick that began to have glitches. I like that it also controls the TV without needing a separate controller. I haven't used voice recognition.

I usually only watch Netflix and Amazon and I want my Amazon button back. Otherwise works as intended.

  As a Roku fan, it pains me to say this. The device I received is garbage. I couldn't get past the system update portion (third step after language selection and wifi connection) without the device freezing up. The issues weren't always the same, but they always prevented me from getting to the next step of activation. Sometime factory resets were necessary. I have 5 other Roku's and they've been great. I don't think I'll ever buy a stick one again after this. Roku is just so easy, I really hope their quality isn't slipping.

  I'm impressed!  Simple to install and use,  It opens an untold number of TV accesses.

  I love these! They're so easy to install and use. I've bought 4 (1 I sent back but it wasn't the device, one TV just wasn't capable of working with the streaming service). These are wonderful and I love that the remote is the only remote you need to work your TV and your Roku device so I don't have to have a million remotes laying around. I highly recommend these if you're looking at going to streaming for your TV watching needs.

  Great user experience with the Roku stick. Simple home screen layout that isn't ruined by ads. Apps are easy to find, add, launch, and use.It would be really nice if you could install a few of the more tech-savvy apps like Firefox and Kodi (the Fire and Shield allow this). Also, the sticks do not include a headphone jack on the remote, unlike the Roku boxes. You can use Roku's phone app to do ""Private Listening"" and plug headphones into your phone to hear the Roku's output, but obviously then you need a phone handy whenever you're watching.

  We liked the roku stick while it worked. In less than a month of use, the stick stopped working. The stick would be plugged in with the power indicator light on, but no signal to the tv. We spent hours talking to tech support, unplugging, resetting, trying different TVs etc. but ultimately couldn't find a resolution. Since we were still under warranty, we sent the stick back and are waiting for our replacement to arrive. Unfortunately, we had to pay for shipping the stick back (which cost close to $10 plus the inconvenience).  It's really poor customer service that we have to foot the shipping bill for their defective product. Would not recommend.

  We had the rocku 3 and ordered this one to replace it. I love the compactness of this roku stick as well as the picture quality. Delivery was fast. We ordered a second one for our bed room. We also love the fact that the roku remote automatically sets its self to control our tv functions too. It’s wonderful to be able to turn our tv on and off, control the volume and the roku with one sleek remote. Our older one never did that. We highly recommend for picture quality and convenience.

I am trying to decide what to do.

  Upfront these are great. You get easy access to the streaming apps you like in HD quality.Unfortunately these sticks don't last very long and they lose the ability to connect to the internet. I've had two of these die within a year and half.

  I have 2 older roku boxes that I've had for years that have been ok. Also have every fire tv device there is. This stick is one of my favorite devices though. It works great and the picture quality is amazing. I love that I can power it with the usb port on the tv so I don't have any cords hanging. I'd like to get another one!

  When my family went streaming and updated to Hulu Live TV, we needed to update our Roku to go with it since the older version of Roku we had was not able to have this newest version of Hulu on it. Since the upgrade, everything moves very fast! We love the interface and the ease of downloading new channels. It was a little pricey but well worth the money for everything to be working so perfectly.

  We’ve had constant issues with connectivity. We just upgraded our internet to the fastest ATT offers, very surprising how bad this roku stick has operated. Our old roku box runs better. We’ll either need to get another roku box or scrap roku altogether.

  I cancelled my satellite tv service, subscribed to a streaming service, which cut my monthly in half. Then I added Roku. Lots of free channels.  Roku stick was extremely easy to install and use. Clear picture,  I own a smart tv and subscribe to internet. I recommend.

  What the F is the point of this?  All this does is provides you to other links to watch stuff.  You still have to pay for it!!Seriously, if you have Amazon Prime video, it's the same thing.  And that's already included in your plan.  Don't buy this.

  I'm not sure what's wrong with my firestick.  When it works, it works GREAT.  But about every 3rd time I turn it one.  I get no sound to any of my services.  Ill unplug it and replug it in, and it will freeze the picture, but continue to play sound.  Its becoming very frustrating.  And I haven't had this issue with my other streaming devices.

  I purchased this Fire TV Stick Lite for use on my tv (Vizio HDCP 1.4).  My tv keeps saying that there is no signal.Since the new device is HDCP 2.2, they must be incompatible.  Is that correct?  I've tried using a HDMI to component video converter, but the only ones I can find are HDMI 1.3 or 1.4 and do not seem to work either.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this work?

  My “smart” TV was just a little too old to add some of the newest apps. I had finally given up my cable TV and was switching to just streaming.

I’m not overly technologically savvy but the Firestick was very simple to set up and use.

  This was supposed to be the top dog, but the setup was not plug and play even on a standard newish tv and internet.  Had trouble connecting to wifi even though all my other devices connected fine at that range.  The online/tv setup connection stunk.  Sadly I would never buy this for my parents or inlaws because i know i would be over at their house for a few hours setting it up.  Other streamers they did on their own.

  I have an old Roku 3 and the new 4K stick. Both freeze and crash all the time and become unresponsive. I then have to unplug them and restart.

Maybe this is more recent. I’ve even engaged them on social media and they never respond. I’ll be trying FireStick next because Roku clearly has an issue in their OS and hasn’t fixed/ won’t help.

  The device is amazing, easy to install and use. My Tv experience is improved by a lot .The only issue I'm really pissed at which made me give it 2 stars is that most of the features do not exist for countries other than US and Canada, and some other countries I prosume.The device works perfectly with Netflix which is why I got it in the first place, but please for the love of god add the app to international iOS stores and don't hog on the features the device provides if you're in a different country ( it feels so discriminating)

  I love this model because it powers on my TV and has volume control.  There is little need for the remote that came with the TV.  I use this to replace my Spectrum cable box.

  Got this to replace one of the original Roku boxes in our house that was wearing out. It works just the same as the box did, but with a smaller remote and obviously just a stick instead of a whole box. Knocked off a star because the remote doesn't come with a handle to put on your wrist like the other ones do. And, the tag is so skinny I can't clip one on easily. This makes it fall and get lost into the couch more often because it's so thin and lightweight. Otherwise, it's great!

  This is a much better option than the Roku Express due to its duel band frequencies, its range and the volume control on the side. A great option for those wanting to make their regular TV a smart TV and much more economical than buying an Xbox or Apple box. Plus, it allows streaming for spectrum TV channels if you have that provider.

  2 thumbs down to Vizio - Only way to play Disney + is ""cast"" it. Bull Hockey to them - no native app in the offing.So bought and installed this guy. You will need access to a laptop to enter the ""link"" code that links the critter and your TV. The smartphone app will help - far easier to enter usernames and passwords on it than using the remote (makes phone act as remote - with a keyboard!)

  This product is awesome.  The apps are great and the picture is beautiful.  The only downfall is the remote (it's on your wifi).  Sometimes the roku and remote can't 'find' each other.  I use my phone so this isn't an issue.  However, if you don't want to use your phone, find another version that doesn't have the ""point anywhere"" remote.  I ordered a replacement and had the same issue.  Again if you use your phone/remote app, it's awesome.

  Cutting the cable ⁉️Roku is a great alternative to cable TV. I’ve installed 5 to replace the recurring monthly fees associated with the cable company box. Saving $100 dollars a month. I’ve also noted my Electric bill declined by $15 a month getting rid of those hot cableboxes so that’s another $180 in savings I didn’t account for.  The batteries last about a month in a heavily used Roku but a couple of AAA’s month.... pittance.

  These are absolutely the best stick type media players if not the best all around. The thing I most appreciate about the ROKU players is the basically incorporate everything including Amazon, Netflix, ROKU, and every other streaming media there is pretty much if it is not on the stick itself which most are including Google/Youtube you can get it through apps and ROKU works with all those as well specifically with this on it is capable of UHD and everything that goes with including Dolby Atmos capabilities etc.

  Really glad I got it. Only hiccup was Netflix stalling out, and had to unplug and restart. Other than that, Roku is incredible. Got it over Amazon stick because Amazon is all about pay this pay for that, but Roku has so much to offer like freebie channels. Main reason was to get Showtime to play without paying for it through Amazon, because I already have an account. Amazon is lacking in so much lately it's almost embarrassing be cause they have trillions to spend. Roku will always be supreme!

  Works quite well and easy to set up. I mainly only use it for NBA league pass and YouTube.I find the arrow pad on the remote a little difficult to use mainly because I'm used to this part of a remote being lower down so I can't always find the arrows by feel and have to look to make sure i have my finger on the right button. Once I have it in place though, it's fine.I also find some of the preset buttons a bit pointless because I don't use Sling, Hulu or Vue so these serve no purpose to me. Maybe these buttons should be programmable shortcuts?NBA League pass works really well. The interface isn't as clean as AppleTV and there is a little lag when switching between days to view games but this is only a minor thing.Once you select the game to play, it loads quickly and streams at the highest bitrate setting. It's easy to navigate through the stream but I wish the right arrow skipped 10 seconds without pausing the video and bringing up the time slider. Because it pauses the stream, you have to press the right arrow and then press enter so make it play which creates an extra step. This is annoying when watching a game a few hours after it has finished as it makes it tedious to skip through breaks in the game.YouTube works well and pretty much the same as on any smart TV. The only things I don't like (navigating, non-qwerty keyboard etc.) are due to the YouTube app itself, nothing to do with the Roku.Overall it's a great little device and works well for what I use it for (mainly NBA League Pass). Would probably give 4.5 or even 5 stars if the navigation of a stream was smoother as mentioned above.

  I've had this remote for just a bit over a year - it's not overused (I use another TV a lot more ) so I was surprised to find that the remote just stopped working!  There was some odd, honey-like substance in the battery compartment - I removed the existing batteries, cleaned the compartment and installed new batteries.  Still not working. Checking with friends who also have had issues with breakdown after only a year's use.  I think ONE YEAR is carrying 'planned obsolescence' a bit far.

  I have a roku express and an older 1080p JVC tv that came with a roku package. So far so good with those two. I really like them, they're reliable. My WiFi is working great also. This streaming stick+, however, has been almost nothing but problems. Between avoiding overheating, having to reset because of freezing, the remote constantly disconnecting, and most recently streaming distorting and going in and out, I finally am giving up and sending it back to Amazon. I also tried customer service to no avail. They were as helpful as they could be but the product just seems faulty.

  Without a doubt, this is the best streaming stick I've used. I also have the Amazon stick and that's fine, but the Roku let's me choose any of my streaming services without having to switch to a separate stick for Amazon. The interface is easy and the connection time is very fast. Because of my happiness with the Roku stick, I bought a TCL Roku TV, so now I don't need any sticks as the Roku is built-in. And on the Roku TV remote there is a plug in for my headset speakers. Very cool.

  We bought the Roku Streaming Stick + in March and everything was great until a few months ago when the remote started not working. We would have to ""reboot"" it by unplugging the stick from the TV and outlet, then let it ""find"" the remote again.  It's gotten to the point now that the remote will hardly work at all. It will let us start a show, but then when we try to pause, it will ""hang"" and stop working. Or it won't work but a foot in front of the TV, if you're lucky. My husband is about to throw the whole system away and just cast via phone apps. In the last hour I have had to unplug the stick twice, and go through the whole reboot process to get the remote to at least do something. So annoying!

  Cut the cord. This works better then I hoped for. Setup was quick and easy. The stick found my network and connected. It all took less then 20 minutes from opening the box to streaming Roku content. Installing apps is straight forward and easy. I’ve been using it for a month and still finding new things out. Paid $49 for the stick and saving $59 a month in cable costs. This is great. Our area has fiber running to each home. Streaming is fast. I should have done this a year ago.

  Throw that chrome cast to the garbage. I am so sorry that i was recommended it for all people around me. Roku is way better streaming than chrome-cast. If you are using PLEX NETFLIX OR SPOTIFY roku is your best choice.Plex: better quality faster and even easier to use with the remote control. YOU WILL HAVE THE 1080p you paid forNetflix: no more auto brightness adjustment no more auto lowering the resolutionI just love how ruko give you the things as it’s meant to beI am not mentioning the free channels which are good to have

  I am used to having a Roku. When I moved and needed a streaming device for my own TV, I researched both the Roku and Fire Stick and I ultimately decided on the Fire Stick. I use it daily and I love it! I don't typically use the voice recognition, and honestly I could go either way with it. It wasn't a hard adjustment to go from the Roku to the Fire Stick, and there isn't anything I miss that was on the Roku.

  The Streaming Stick+ is a great product but has a bad habit of freezing up. The TV will be playing a show and then the image will suddenly freeze in place. When reviewing Roku user forums the freezing problem seems to have been around for years and apparently Roku has not yet resolved the technical problem. The Streaming Stick+ gets five stars when it works and, of course, zero stars when it doesn't.

  I was able to hook this up myself. If you have problems unplug everything and start over. Check the date on the batteries in case the Roku control doesn't work. Also read the instructions exactly. If you take shortcuts and don't follow every step it will take longer to set up because you will miss a step. Don't get frustrated if you do mess up. Just start over and before you know it you will be watching your favorite shows.

  Super easy to install and setup was a breeze.  Just what I needed for an older, but still excellent, plasma TV that needed streaming capability.

My only gripe is the remote can only handle turning the TV off OR controlling the volume on my sound bar, but not both simultaneously...if anyone knows how to make that happen, then I would only need 1 remote.

  I love the features available on the new stick+ such as the option for 4K, faster processor and especially the attached wireless receiver. I think the stick+ is a great upgrade from the older models.  However, I did encounter a couple of issues.  First, this stick is longer than the older model I have and it doesn't fit into the HDMI port on the back of my television.  I have to order a separate 270 degree (right angle) adapter piece before I can install it.  I'm concerned that connecting with a generic adapter may either affect the fidelity of the connection or may not be fully compatible with my HMDI port.  Second, the power cable attaches to roku on the side, as opposed to the end of the stick as my previous roku, so the power cable sticks up and out from the side of my TV and looks awkward.  I would still recommend this stick+ for the more advanced features, but those are issues that I think roku and customers should be aware of.

The one gripe I have is that Roku threw errors that our brand new tv wasn’t compatible with HDMI 2.0 copyright and so we had to unplug everything a few times to get it to work. Picture quality is amazing.

  We have a strong WiFi connection with several devices throughout our home.  All devices remain consistently connected with the exception of the Roku Stick+.  In the 4 months we have used it, connection drops frequently.  Other devices in the same room do not drop connection.  That was frustrating enough, but now the remote has stopped working.  Roku has no customer support via chat or phone, only email.  I downloaded the Roku app on my smart phone, hoping for a solution.  Doesn't work.  Factory reset doesn't work either.

  This device ran at a temperature of 120 degrees when plugged into my TV's HDMI port, whether powered by USB or wall outlet. Too hot to touch and too hot for nearby TV components. I contacted ROKU and they sent me a replacement device but that one did the same thing.  I tried to call customer service and was told there would be a 12 minute wait.  20 minutes later the recording said the wait was 17 minutes so I hung up.  Very disappointing.  ROKU seems to be going downhill despite their excellent product reputation.  Stay away from this particular product if a running temperature of 120 degrees in your HDMI port scares you.

  It replaced an Apple TV as it is much easier to use and has the Amazon Prime programing as well as our other apps. Great product, only wish it came with 2 remotes for the battles with my spouse.The Apple is finding it's way to the trash.

  I knew what I was buying with this product. I knew there would be no TV controls. I was ok with that cause it was for a TV that isn't used as often but this barely functions. It won't come on unless I unplug the power cord and plug back in. It constantly freezes and and scrolling through the menu lags. I wish I would have spent a few more dollars on the standard one.

  I bought this to use with my tv in my bedroom. It was easy to set up and use.  I don’t use Alexa so I didn’t rate it for that.No issues.  Bought it on Qvc when they were selling it for $29.99.

  This is so easy to use and so easy to set up! I had some issues with the streaming services on my tv. I thought I would give Roku a try before buying an all new tv. Low and behold it not only fixed the issues, it made everything more accessible! Took all of about 20 minutes to set up everything.

  Love the Roku.  Allowed me to cut my cable bill.  But, one of my remores works when it wants to.  I've changed batteries 3 times in just the last month and it still works when wants to.Worked last night, but not this morning???

  Instead of paying for cable, I use roku for netflix, disney plus, hulu, and so much more. Having it on this one thing is so convenient and has so many different features that normal tv does not have. There's so many sports channels too if there's people wondering if it includes that, it goes above and beyond!

  This is THE BEST inexpensive streaming device available.  Roku overall has always been very good and this unit just gets better.  It allows you to use the 5g signal on your WiFi for improved performance and range.

  Has anyone else experienced multiple  problems within the first week of owning your Roku? Overheating in a well ventilated area, the screen going black and not returning, receiving multiple HDCP errors, etc..? I’ve literally used this thing 5 times over the past week for a few hours at a time. Two days ago, I started seeing the problems mentioned. Has this happened to you?

  I Love the technology Voice recognition is great that’s the first thing we tried. If you are a prime member it links to your account and all the perks my music , movie purchases are all linked to my fire stick. The volume control and Alexa integration is Great. I have no complaints I have brought 3 so far.

  This version comes with a remote that doesn't have tv controls.  However, if you are replacing an older, slower unit. The remote you currently have will work with this new one.  Just press and hold down the home key when instructed during setup.  Worked just fine.  And, boy... this one is so much faster than the old one.

  Had no issues whatsoever until recently when it just stopped connecting to WiFi. Its unfortunate because it’s outside the return window and just feels like a waste of money. I was better off using an hdmi cord and laptop to screen from. The price was good but likely because the quality isn’t there. I would not recommend for a longer streaming solution.

  I purchased this because it was on sale and our one downstairs needed a replacement. However, I really don't like the live button feature because I was so used to clicking the bottom button and pausing what I was watching. Don't use the live tv, don't need the button.  Everything else was fine. The live button just wasn't an option that mattered to me.

  Once I figured out how to install in to my system, it works great! It is super convenient to have all streaming on one device. I don't have Alexa, nor do I want it, but the controls are super easy to use. I would definitely recommend!

  Well it's only been a day, but it was easy to install, great streaming so far.And for the menu, and adding apps it was so simple.The Roku stick basically syncs everything for you.This just made my TV experience so much better :)

  
"

  I'm not particularly electronic-savvy, but I found this to take less than 5 minutes to set up.  I especially love that it comes with a USB power adapter that plugs right in to the USB port on my TV...one less wire dangling.  I already had one in my living room, and I wanted one for the bedroom.  Very easy to set up...step-by-step instructions are easy to follow.

  This was a replacement unit as our last unit overheated. (Errors displayed on TV warning of overheating).It’s a functional Roku, but it frequently loses connection to our Internet. I know it’s related to the unit as our phones continue to function on the WiFi.

  Repeatedly lost wifi connection, had to reboot and log in to services multiple times.  Remote froze. Wifi connection for other devices in the same area was fine. Disappointing.  First-time set-up, guidance through adding channels, etc., was fine - just weak connectivity.  In the trash after about the fifth reboot.

  I plugged in, and after a simple few set up screens, i was watching vivid video, and the speed to access compared to the apps on my DVD player, TV, and cable box is tremendous. Adding apps via PC website (can be done on phone, but i prefer the PC). was a breeze. Login  to pay for apps also easy. Go Buy This, you will love it.

  We have had the Roku express model for years, and got this streaming stick for another TV in the house. Within 3 months of light use, the remote constantly is draining batteries. I have to replace them every week to use the remote. Not worth the price, other models are more reliable.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I honestly cannot say enough positive things about this streaming stick and while there is quite a few selection offered by Roku, the streaming stick is by far, my choice. Smooth interface, easy set-up (even for non-techies like myself) and great picture! Roku hasn't failed me yet.... Another satisfying purchase.

  
"

  I was surprised that most every primetime show I would care to watch charged additional fees. I found it impossible to find a search area to add new channels, even though I researched blogs and read lots of instructions on different Roku sites. Maybe it is because I live in Mexico that is becomes a completely unmanueverable hard to navigate system.  I was going to subscribe to Startz to watch one particular show. One person said they subscribed thru Startz and could not unsubscribe successfully. Another person subscribed to Starz thru Roku, they could not unsubscribe either. If a device causes wasted time and frustration like this, why bother? I have a few days to return and I will find a better system, where I can watch shows when I want, with no commercials. Those systems costs about $120. USD equivalent with no monthly fees. Maybe it works for some, just not for me.

  Works great, Alexa seems to mind us.  can turn the tv on and off with the remote. The only thing I don't like is the volume control for the tv is right on the side where you hold it and I keep turning the volume down by accident.

  I have a TV in the upstairs living room that would lose Internet connection with my old Roku, saw this one with long-range connection and decided to give it a try. So glad I did! It streams perfectly, rarely freezes or loses connection. Definitely recommend!!

  Setting the firestick to work with older smart TV's isn't easy. Have to sacrifice some of the normal remote functionsto even have some control with the firestick. Found it was easier to use the old remote instead of asking Alexa to do it. If I had a newer model smart TV it might be fine but have to wait till this one breaks before I can test that out. Sorry, I couldn't be happier with the results but is what it is.

  This stick is fantastic. I runs smoothly and looks great. It set up quickly and I can turn my tv on and off and control the volume with the remote. So far this is my go to device for streaming. I have a couple fire sticks and a fire cube and a Intel NUC. I like the amazon cube , but talking to it does not always seem natural and you need to talk to it to control the volume and power. The ROKU feels better for my needs and I seem to use that the most.

  We have used Google Chromecast and the Amazon Firestick, and Roku is amazing!  This is our first time using Roku, but we thought we would give it a try and we absolutely love it!  It is super easy for the kids to use, it is easy to find things, the set up of each app is super nice and easy, there are a ton of free things you can watch...this is just absolutely amazing!  We will definitely be buying more Roku sticks in the future for other TVs! Love, love, love it!

  The device is good and does its job. There is no reason for Roku to collect date of birth and other personal information in the name of customizing user experience. It also collects gender as binary choice male or female.  The company needs to do better! The remote does not have a headphone jack in the new generation, a feature I used to love!

  i especially like the included 4k app where there's content exclusive to 4k sets. haven't watched it much but let's just say it's a feel-good thing. i have 2 sticks. one went belly-up but although it was well after the 30-day return period for the vendor, roku came through and replaced it! IMPRESSIVE.so why only 4 stars? it needs a mute button. and for that aggravation alone, a fire 4k is on order!

  I had this for less than 2 months and got an overheating message on tv.  I returned it within the return window because I did not want any hassles dealing with it.  I put my older one in same spot and works flawlessly.  I suspect this new model has an issue, since others have reported same problem.

  Constantly freezes and loses connection despite strong signals. I have to restart it at least once a day to get it working again. I've changed batteries, factory reset it, Uninstalled almost every channel, used different wifi signals. Only 6 months old and it's garbage. This is my 4th Roku, and I've never had these problems.

  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had a Roku stick that wasn't that old, but just worked like crap. I couldn't take all the lag, so I buckled and bought a new one. The price on this wasn't bad, and I can't complain so far. Apps all run fast. No problems with full 1080p streaming. I just hope it's a couple years before I have to buy another one.

I still can get to my Netflix and prime movies through ROKU too.

  I have spent a long time trying to perform the “easy setup” and keep getting the same error when it gets to the new updates phase. This isn’t the first time I have had tech problems but the complete lack of a customer service person to talk to as far as I can tell makes try to solve the problem feel impossible. It doesn’t even give you the option to not update so it is not useable at all unless I can fix it. I might as well have thrown my money in the trash.  I saw some reviews warning of this and should have listened

  Streams much faster and the picture is better than my old Roku. As always, easy setup. Only little irritant is if you are using a sound bar and you disable you tv sound, I always touch the volume control when I change channels and get a NOT AVAILABLE! message on the screen. Not a deal breaker. Roku, it's what we do!

  This was my 4th Firestick and I plan to continue using what works!  I enjoy Firestick on all my televisions. It gives me access to great entertainment without leaving my home.  Alexa is totally interactive and easy to use. The set-up is just as simple. I highly recommend the Firestick!

  I received the Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote Lite as a gift from my in-laws for Christmas. My husband and I enjoy the variety and options available. The Fire TV Stick is extremely easy to use too.

  Our old Vizio HDTV died suddenly, so we replaced it with a a Samsung UHDTV. Being cable cutters we were already using an HD Roku device to stream all of our TV channels, but now we needed a compatible Roku device for our UHDTV. We could not be happier. The new Roku Streaming Stick+ provides flawless 4K UHD through our home WiFi network without skipping a beat. Highly recommended!

  This saved my life LOL. I purchased Philo for the house but was unable to get it on the most important TV. I just plugged the Roku stick in and not only was able to get Philo but also Disney+ that I had been missing out on. LOVING it!

  Here are my experiences with the 2017 Streaming Stick+ Roku.First let me specify my setup.  I have a slow 2.4 (typically) Mbps Internet connection.  Previously I was using a Panasonic BMP110 Blu-Ray player for what little streaming I did.  That was mainly used for trying out the Vudu free movies.  It was marginal; with my slow connection, sometimes it would work pretty well, and sometimes it would complain and give up intermittently.I have a Yamaha VX-477 Receiver.And it all feeds into a 2011 Panasonic Plasma TV.Setup:It probably isn’t very important, but the remote uses AAA batteries, not AA.  I slapped in a couple of Eneloops and it’s happy.I see people complaining about having to give credit card information to activate their Roku.  This is not necessary.  Go to the page made for this option: my dot roku dot com/signup/nocc, and you can create a Roku account without entering any credit card or PayPal information.  I know, because I did it.If you’re wondering about using the Roku with an A/V receiver, that works.  I plugged the stick into one of the HDMI inputs on my Yamaha, and it works just fine.  4K wouldn’t cut it, because my receiver doesn’t really support it.  But my TV isn’t 4K anyway, so that isn’t a problem.Some people are complaining about HDCP errors.  This is probably because they’re trying to use 4K video on a TV that doesn’t support HDCP 2.2.  My five year old TV works just fine, because it’s only 1080p.  If you want to see 4K video, make sure your TV really supports HDCP2.2.  And you need an HDMI connection that also supports HDCP 2.2.  On some TVs that’s only one port.If 1080p24 is important to you, Roku says only the 4K devices can do it.  I had to turn it off; when the movie would break for commercials, the receiver usually flaked out.  I would have to switch HDMI inputs on the receiver, then switch back to the original.  The guide says the screen may flash black; mine mainly went to snow, and wouldn’t recover.  So I’m doing without 1080p24.  It might work better for people who plug it directly into the TV; I didn’t try that.The specs talk about 802.11ac, but it works just fine on my old router without ac.To set this thing up, look at the Quick Start Guide, or just go to the Roku page about your specific device.  Basically I just plugged the stick into an HDMI input, plugged the power adapter into my UPS, and connected the cables.  It started right up.I haven’t tried different models, so I can’t offer a comparison.  But the Streaming Stick+ works great.First you have to pick a wireless network, and provide the password.  Then the stick downloads the latest firmware.When it restarted, mine didn’t connect the first time, even though it indicated it still remembered the password. After sitting for a while with a spinning wheel, it finally gave a 014.40 error, and suggested some alternatives.  I just unplugged the power cable and plugged it back in.  It restarted, and everything was fine.It will go through a few screens, and give you a four letter code.  Go back to the page you end up at after creating your account online, or the page they refer you to.  Enter the code, and you’re all set.  You can select some channel options.  Your stick is now busy setting up channels.And things seem to be working great.  It does fine showing a movie in standard definition.  It  has trouble with the commercials; I wonder if they’re a higher definition.  But it gets over it quickly.Things like rewind and fast forward are far better than on my old Blu-Ray player.So far I’m just using things that are free.  Look around online at the Roku site, and you can see what’s available.So in summary:This thing works surprisingly well with a slow connection.  You don’t get 4K video, but it looks pretty good in old-fashioned 1080p (which is probably really a lot less, as in standard def upscaled to 1080).It works plugged into a receiver that then separates out the audio, and passes the video on to the TV.It works with old routers that don’t have 802.11ac.  And it works with new routers that have 5GHz ac.You can create an account without providing any credit card information.I recommend this device to anyone that needs a streaming connection.

  I already owned one and purchased a second for another tv. I also have Chromecast and a Firestick. I wish these had backlighting! The remote is hard to read in the dark. That's my only complaint. I bought mine on Prime Day and got a great deal.  I'm a happy customer!

  Set up is frustrating. it does not want you to go forward in the set up unless you feed them your CC personal information. i was able to proceed with out giving all my information. the device wants to know your birth date, gender and other personal information. you cannot continue with giving them that information. what are they doing with it you should ask yourself?

  This roku model is better than the other that I had previously. This one has much more clarity, doesn't have to have the controller in line of sight, and has the ability to turn the sound up and down ( I previously had to use a second controller for that). The only thing lacking IMO is a ""mute"" button

  The stick itself is fine my issue is with the remote. It stutters alot. I'm pressing it and it takes a while for it to work on stick. This is second stick, sent first one back for the same thing. I think it might be a default in the product. Anyone else having this issue.

  I don't know how Roku can bill the wifi as functional for 4k. I had to get an adapter that would let me connect directly to an ethernet cable. My wifi router had an excellent signal and was right next to it. I turned off everything using the wifi and the 4k still had blurry spots. Otherwise, it's very user friendly and wonderfully customizable.

  Didn’t like this version at all.  It would hardly ever load even if it would always show connected to WiFi.  We may have just gotten a faulty one but I think we’ll stuck to the regular fire stick instead of the lite.  Already returned ours.

  I really don't think I should submit a review as I have not been able to use this product.  I tried to set it up, but i don't think I fully understood how.  My son is coming to town soon, and he states he can set it up as he has one and he purchased mine as a gift.  After I get it set up, I can re-submit a fair review.  I'm sure it will be alright, as many other family members have the Fire stick and they all love it.

  I installed on an 1080p tv and the clarity of this Roku stick is really impressive. The only glitch, if it is a Roku glitch is that Youtube keeps on disconnecting, hence the 4 star rating.

  I use a Google home to control lights and the like and was excited to see that the Roku added support for Google Assistant.  There are only a couple of commands and they are not clearly documented.  I say this as someone who has spent the time to learn commands for different devices and platforms.Overall streaming works quite well but the 4K is a little pointless (on both the TV and Streaming Stick).

  I have an older Roku that did not work very well on my basement TV, which is the furthest point from my wireless router.  The Roku Streaming Stick + said it has long range wireless connectivity. It was easy to hookup and I was streaming in a few minutes.  Roku delivered.  No more time outs and restarts like I had to do with my older Roku.Shout out to Cosmos TECH, the seller, who worked with me to resolve an issue.

  Great wifi range and super easy set up.  I purchased to replace my amazon stick because it did not get good connection to wifi from the living room tv and this roku stick+ has no problems connecting to wifi to allow me to watch all my shows without buffering.  It connected to the tv sound super easy without using any codes and even controls the sound bar we have set up with the TV.  It is so easy to use that even my 75 year old father can work it with ease.  LOVE this product!

  I didn't know what to expect with ROKU, only knew I needed it to stream HULU since my 'smart' tv was no longer up to the newest technology.  ROKU was a breeze to install,  easy to follow instructions.  There are so many links to free TV stations with movies and series.  Best purchase that I've made in a while.  Most definitely recommend it.

  This product is not as reliable as the old models (one of which I have had for 5 years).  If the wireless connection is interrupted (uh - power blips), it does not connect as easily.  It has a propensity to display ""not connected"" and ""Missing advanced wireless receiver"" messages when this happens.  Am keeping it as a back up, but am buying the Roku Ultra.

  I ordered this after I had moved to Mexico with my older Roku device. I had little TV reception and couldn't stay on Roku due to lousy internet.

Once I did the EASY set up, Netflix and all my channels were immediately available. I could not be more please!!

  I gave this 3 stars due to the frustration of activation. Instead of the old method of entering a code you have to provide an email and wait for the link.It took 3 days to get an email. I attached this thing to 3 different SSIDs on two separate routers and nothing. I rebooted, resubmitted, nothing. I finally attempted another activation days later and got the code.Once it was activated the product itself was great but I was in the process of returning this when that final attempt was succesfull. Roku needs to fix their activation method.

  I wish I could give this a better review, but it began overheating as soon as I had it up and running.

  So rather than pay monthly for boxes on my additional tv’s I tried this and I am so happy I did! It is so simple to move that in seconds I can move it from one room to another. I use it in the kitchen during the day and my bedroom at night. Set up was very simple. I needed no help. The remote works my tv for on and off and volume as well as the Roku. I only wish it had page up and down so I could scan channels faster. I love it anyway. I believe it is the only stick that works for Comcast, however it works with other providers too.

  Roku is probably the most versatile streaming device that is compatible with the highest number of streaming services.  The streaming stick plus is capable of 4k.  It is very easy to connect and set up.  The remote has the capability of controlling your TV so it is the only remote you need.  Purchasing the stick gives you a lifetime subscription to the Roku channel that has interesting movies that change every month.

  It works as expected . I have run into issues where the interface freezes. A reboot of the Roku fixes the same. SInce i have bought it have done this couple of times. I have 150MBS download capability and even then i sometimes see the streaming is choppy for a while and then it recovers. I have a Netgear Nighthawk wireless router which within 3 meters of the Roku.

  Interface is really slow compared to other streaming devices. Drains batteries in under a week even if you dont use them. Customer support from Roku is abysmal.

  I hated having 2 remotes, one for Roku and one to turn the TV off and on and use for volume. This Roku solves that problem. I haven't tried the voice command yet, so no comments on that. Only downside is it doesn't connect to an external soundbar. But perfect for a bedroom if you are tired of multiple remotes. And got a great deal on Prime Day!

  I have 3 Roku Players in our home. 2 Roku Ultra's and the new streaming stick+.  I upgraded the the kiddo's to the new Roku streaming stick+. It works better than the previous roku express streaming media player. Turns the TV on and off without another remote. The picture quality is Great. It was easy to install. Easy to set up. You don't even know it's there.  We like the Roku layout. We like that you can require a pin to make purchases on the Roku or add channels. We love not paying for cable or satellite. We love being able to choose the channels we want to watch. Amazon Video, Netflix... you name it they are all available at your fingertips via the Roku. Something for everyone in the home to watch or listen to. Once we got the Roku's we ditched apple tv and all the others we used. No need for them. Roku ecosystem was better for us. We subscribe to Sling TV and have been very happy so far with that set up. We have good internet access throughout our home using google wifi. Would recommend that setup if you would like to do your whole home.

  Overall, the Roku streaming stick works as advertised. It is very simple to set up and the interface works very well. The only thing that I would like most is the ease of moving back and forth from TV (cable service) to streaming service. Every TV/service I currently have still has a learning curve and sometimes mind-numbing way of switching back and forth.

  Product overheats constantly. Starts to overheat within 5-10 minutes of turning it on.Roku said to put an extension cable on it. Tried that. Still overheats just as fast.Roku said to put it somewhere with airflow. Moved it to out in the open air in front of my entertainment center. It sticks out and has air flowing on all sides. Still overheats in 5-10 minutes.This appears to be a common issue with the 4K models.This is my fourth Roku stick. The previous ones were not 4K and worked very well. This one is not up the same level of quality.

  I was a DISH satellite girl for years until my son introduced me to the Roku streaming stick. I was hesitant for awhile. Truthfully, I bought the Roku streaming stick and procrastinated for literally a year to activate the stick. Finally, after getting frustrated with the monthly fees of over $150. per month I finally activated the stick and I'm kicking myself for not doing it when i bought it! I love streaming TV and only the channels I want, not paying for channels I never watch and subscribe to Live TV as well for under $60. per month! Love, Love the Roku and I will never go back to satellite or cable TV again!!

  This product is a bait and switch!!!!  They require a $75 activation fee to use the device or they will shut off all devices. So I bought a new Roku for the basement just to watch Netflix on and now my other Roku which was working perfectly has been disabled because I refused to pay the fee. Rokus channels are terrible I wouldn’t pay $3 for their service. Terrible!!!! Roku Customer service argued with me over paying for Prime. I’m sorry Roku you are not Prime and you will be promptly returned.

  Love my roku's.  No more cable boxes other than hd dvr.  Plus can take this anywhere and see my shows, recordings, access my media server, and see my digital content at my finger tips when traveling.

  It's great!  When we go on vacation we always hook it up to the room TV and many times you don't need the AC power cord because the TV can power it itself.  We pull up Netlfix and Amazon Prime and watch what we want without having to pay for premium channels.  It's easy to hook-up.  Great investment.  It's on our vacation packing list.

  It was suggested to us by our cable provider to purchase this product for our bedroom tv to save money so we didn't have to pay the monthly fee for a cable box.  We were skeptical but figured it was worth a try.  It was easy to hook up and works great!  We've not had any issues with streaming tv in our bedroom and our WIFI box is in our living room.  The only con....my husband wishes we could access our recorded items on our DVR but it's a small price to pay for saving money!

  I upgraded to this model from the original Streaming Stick specifically for the extended wifi range. Not impressed. I would say it's perhaps a 10% improvement, certainly not 4x. And the voice recognition is spotty at best. Reminds me of Siri. At some point you get frustrated and just quit trying.

  For the price at 2999 plus tax this is a bargain. You will have a remote that is voice operated with Amazon Alexa. The fire-stick does absolutely everything that the bigger 4K fire stick does yet at a very minimum price. I absolutely love this item and I've had this is zero problems

  This fire stick does not work. Within a few weeks of having it, it will no longer start. I have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to start. Now the sound is no longer working. I plugged in another fire stick and the sound was working so I know it’s not an issue with the tv.

  I have both the Amazon Firestick and the Roku stick.  I prefer the Roku as the remote allows us to control the TV.  Picture quality is good and streaming is good.UPDATE 01/28/19Both Roku streaming sticks I have have are now unusable.  After only a years time!  I’ve tried new batteries, different TV’s, unplugging them.....all kinds of things but they still freeze up or don’t respond.  I can no longer recommend Roku devices.  I’m back to my Amazon Firestick.

  To install this product, the seller requires the buyer to supply a credit card number for billing purposes. I don't want to be tethered to Roku and I refuse to be billed regularly for the use of the product. I will not be using the product.

  Nice device, very capable, with easy setup. But be aware of all the reviews, this one included, highlighting the very short battery life for the remote control. 3-4 days is typical. Roku is aware of this but there doesn't seem to be a fix out.

  simple design. my buy motivation was to stop the buffering issues on my generation one streaming stick. this 2nd generation solved the buffering problem. As simple as that. The remote review. Simple classic design. everyone can use and immediately understand it. can turn tv on and off, and adjust tv volume. no more multiple remotes needed. speed dial hulu and Netflix. This is my review after 2nd day. expect and hoping for long product life. Look and Feels like a quality product.

  Delivered just an hour ago, haven't even been able to even set up the product, as the left and right buttons on the remote are non-functional, up and down work and most other buttons work just fine. We can't even enter the Wi-Fi password to complete the setup, extremely frustrating. And ""due to COVID19, NO phone support AT ALL! Looks like this will end up being returned. Not worth $40 for a useless product...

  I like this a lot, very responsive & fast. I can watch my Xfinity sub anywhere within my wi-fi range. Apple TV, Disney +, prime video, Xfinity & Pluto free TV is all I need! And hundreds of other channels to add on.The stick has one end that plugs into the TV’s HDMI port & the other end plugs into a electrical wall socket - that’s it! Move it to any TV in the house or outside. Great to travel with too!

  Our Smart TV is so old that Hulu and Amazon are both no longer supported. I'm so glad that we decided to purchase the Roku instead of a whole new TV. Everything is working great now. Interface is so much better. Free channels are a huge bonus. I can see the national news now as well as see congress in session.

  This is the third Roku I have owned (Roku 2 & 3), and by far the easiest to install and immediately use!  Simply find a USB port on the back of your Smart TV and plug it in.  Within a few minutes of starting up, verifying most recent software update, and then logging into your account, you’re ready to start streaming!In addition, the remote can easily control the Roku, even though the stick is plugged into the back of the TV, without a direct line of sight.  No hiccups, no delays, just quick and easy control on the first click!I love the Roku Stick!!!

  This product functions well once setup but I found the setup process to be tedious and a little frustrating .For our display, the stick would not fit directly into the HDMI port due to the size of the Roku Stick.  Roku freely offers a cable extension but be aware that if you need this, you will have to order it on the Roku website which takes a few days to receive.

  After about three weeks I’ve experienced major pains to the point where I’ve decided to replace the item. The stick has crashed a few times where apps would have a delayed response and sometimes not even respond. In other scenarios the stick won’t even activate from the screen saver, which requires me to unplug the outlet and wait a few minutes to hard reboot. I generally recommend Roku but this is a piece of trash and I’d avoid this version of a Roku stick.

  This is a great upgrade from previous models.  What I didn’t know is that it can pair with my Apple devices!  So much better than paying for a Apple TV streaming device.  I am still learning to use the remote but the voice recognition working the way I thought it would with YouTube TV.  I was hoping to search for channels but instead it just try’s to open separate apps.  I do enjoy this device- especially the ability to control RV sound from the side remote.

  It works great! Very easy to use (my 4 year old quickly learned how to use it to get the shows that she wanted).  I love the quick access buttons on the bottom for netflicks and hulu.  It was very easy to set up.  I only wish it had a remote find feature like the ultra has, because I lost the clicker and it was never found.  To replace the remote, I had to pay almost $30, because it is not the same as other roku devices.  (However, there is a free phone app that works like a remote.)

  This is our third Roku device, we have been using them for years. The Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Voice Remote works great with our 1080p Television but does not work with our older 720p television. It causes the 720p TV to keep seeking a video resolution and the TV strobes on and off. The same 720p TV works fine with the older Roku unit. So, I only use it on the 1080p TV. I also think the voice remote should work in more areas on the Roku interface.

  This thing is my life. I use it daily to watch TV on a 4K TV. Zero lag, fast to navigate and picture quality is top notch for 4K programs. I had a Roku 3 and an old Roku stick which was one of the originals. This 4k stick packs a punch surpasses the speed in processor of all the Rokus that I've owned.  Roku has done outstanding in making their products more compact and even more powerful!

  I like the streaming stick, my only problem is that the remote quits working, an the only way to overcome it is to remove the batteries. Once reinserted it usually works, but it is a hassle to deal with everytime I use it. Not easy to get ahold of Roku.

  I am Roku fan, but normally I have the previous version of the streaming device which works very good and is cheaper. With this streaming stick, from time to time I have to disconnect the HDMI because is too hot. I am afraid it could cause damage to my TV or even a fire. In addition sometimes the device froze and again I have to disconnect it, it is annoying having to do this when it happens

  Super-easy to set up.  Have a Roku TV, so already a fan of the interface.Took 10 minutes total, to auto-recognize TV controls, set up all the streaming channels, and get Plex and NAS going.And, it has zero horizontal footprint: just a cable coming out of the back.At $29, it's a steal.

  I love Roku and this streaming stick was great for 1 1/2 years but the remote is not working right at all and a replacement is pricey cause its a wifi remote.Other models  remotes can be replaced for $8 compared to $25 for this one. I think  the premiere model looks fine and a whole set up only $9 more than the stick remote alone

  Really Roku?  You can't include and HDMI cable.  The stick is too long to fit into the area around my HDMI ports - so, unlike the  Firestick, which includes a short HDMI jumper, this is poorly designed and will not work.Sending back and sticking with Firestick

  The remote is not overwhelming for users who are intimidated by too many buttons.  Even my housemate, very tech-challenged is able to feel comfortable using the Roku.  Easily the best feature.

  Due to prices tripling, I cancelled cable four years ago. Then due to the world's worst customer service, I cancelled DIRECTV. I got Roku. I give it 9.5 out of 10. I can't criticize much. It would be nice if I could arrange my favorite channels in a place I could find them more easily. (A more organized channel manager might come later, though.) Pretty great overall. I love the range of the Wi-Fi. That's why I chose this streaming device over others. Very happy with it.

  it's a little bit not perfect, I have it being powered off one of the USB ports on the back of the TV, it does get enough power and everything was fine for a wile but now after power up the remote needs to be kept very close to the TV tell it links to the Roku. if your holding it wile sitting on the couch it wont link. kind of goofy in that regard but otherwise it's very good.

  After 52 days, the volume control stopped working properly -- the volume automatically went up continuously or down continuously -- it could not be adjusted to a specific level.  Other controller functions also stopped working.  I could not determine if the problem was with the controller or the streaming stick.  The problem was not with the TV or wireless/internet connections.

  This streaming stick is the best yet from Roku. 4K and fast response from a stick format is a definite leap ahead. This is the first Roku stick format that doesn't feel like a compromise. Powers fine off the USB port on the back of my TV - just takes several seconds to boot up when I turn the TV on. I also really like that there is now TV power and volume right on the remote. I have the TV mounted on the wall with an extremely thin cord track that runs down with only the power cord. Made for a very easy and clean looking install. Roku has an extremely extensive channel lineup. I just wish they would update their interface. Voice search and app launch also works well. Highly recommended!

  I love the Roku Streaming Stick!  We do still have one tv on cable and the roku replaced a box that was costing $ 8.00 a month.  Paid for itself in just a few months.  The new remote has volume and power buttons on it so we only need the tv remote if we need to change the input or menu items.

  I had an older generation Apple TV and was looking for other affordable options to stream apps & subscriptions. I really enjoyed using the fire stick AT FIRST..... when I try to watch movies, the audio is out of sync in about 15 minutes. I have to keep pausing and playing to (briefly) rectify the issue. I have tried every AV sync suggested fix out there and nothing seems to help. Frustrated beyond belief!!!!

  Great and easy to use product! So much content and much more flexible compare to the AppleTV. You just need to know the channel name you would like to watch and then you can add it on to your watchlist. Installation and setup was quite easy! Bought it for my parents and it was quite easy for them to use. There's an app you can download from Roku on your ios devices which you can control like the controller but from your phone.Would recommend anyone to purchase this.

  I have has this for 7 months and it has stopped working. The remote will not pair with the device and it turns out that's because the device (although it says it's connected) is not connected to anything and will not connect. I just saw other reviews stating that the roku plus just stops working or there is a $70 upgrade needed, which is completely ludicrous. No wonder the product is no longer available. I have roku's on all of my TVs but i will never purchase another and will warn others not to purchase as well.

  I really like my Roku. I had one about 10 years ago and loved it. A few years ago my daughters bought me a smart 4K tv and I gave my Roku to a friend (they love it, got rid of their Dish satellite). I had lots of problems with the smart tv apps and decided to go back to Roku. Glad I did. Love the 4K content. Still have Dish because I live in remote area and could not get local programs via antenna.

  We were looking for a way to cut our overpriced cable bill so my son recommend trying a Roku to replace the boxes the cable company supplies.  I ordered it and it was delivered the next day. The Roku was so easy to install, the entire process took me 15 minutes including online set up. The picture quality is amazing! Much better than what the cable company provides. I even re-watched the GoT episode Battle of Winterfell and were able to actually see it! I will be buying more to replace the cable boxes I have left in the house. It's worth every penny.

  I have a Vizio TV and it does not offer certain channels/apps that I really want, so I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick.

Delivery was fast and set up was easy. I like that I can control the power and volume with the Roku remote control too. I love it!

Now I've to buy another one for that bedroom tv.

  The Roku Streaming Stick+ has been a very positive experience thus far. This is the third different generation of Roku devices I have owned and probably my favorite so far. I like the ability to plug the stick directly into my TV through both the HDMI and USB for power. Doing so keeps the device hidden from view and doesn't take up any additional space. I was a little hesitant, at first, thinking the stick may not be sufficient for my household WiFi configuration, as I have gigabit fiber service, but this device would be utilized on a floor above the router in a room I previously used a hardwired streaming device. So far, though, the results have been great. Signal strength has been strong and I have not suffered any performance issues. I have also enjoyed the remote with this device. Private listening over the mobile app is a nice feature compared to the audio output on the remote on one of my other Roku devices.Overall, I have been impressed.

  Beware that you will not be able to use this on a wall mounted flatscreen if your tv doesn’t have the HDMI port where it’s parallel to the wall! It cannot stick out.

  These Roku sticks are required to plug into the wall. There advertised to plug into your television using a USB port however when you do the batteries only last two days and your remote control. Roku should really be doing something about this. I spent time going back-and-forth with their health department and their answer was to plug it into the wall. Kind of defeats the purpose when your TV is hanging on the wall and there’s no outlet available.

Sound would be a nice feature, but Roku Streaming Stick only offers sound for about 5 months, then it starts to garble and you have to reset the settings, unplug the stick and plug it back in, Eventually it will not make any sound at all.Crappy quality and the metal connections for HDMI TV and Audio components are not snug and secure.

  This worked fine for a few months and then it started giving me low USB power message and asking me to use an approved cable/power. It would keep crashing and most time would not restart even after unplugging and re-plugging it in. Tired waiting for a few mins between those operations as well. I am using the USB cable that came with it that plugs into the power outlet so there should be no issue with the power at all. Will be switching to a better product.

  This is a great product. I prefer the Roku over the Amazon Fire Stick. Very easy to set up and use. I got YouTube Tv for $40 a month to replace my cable boxes. Saving $100 a month from switching. I also have Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriptions. This is also good if your have wireless internet and the router is not in the same room. I bought 3 of these to replace cable.

  7 days in a week. If I turn the TV on twice a day, that means I'm using this 14 times a week. I have to struggle to get this thing to actually turn on 12/14 times I turn it on. I have to unplug it 6/14 times I turn it on.

  Bought the Roku Streaming Stick +  to replace a very old Roku device, and I love it!  Easy to install, set up, and love the new remote with voice activation.  Plus only need this one remote while watching Roku, whereas my old one had to toggle between 2 remotes.  Highly recommend!

  I have used other streaming devices in the past and this particular Roku gets my vote. Easy to install and use. Streaming movies and golf lessons continuously makes this a great device and the price is on the inexpensive side.

  After reading that Roku's new streaming stick + had voice search capability, 4K, enhanced WiFi connectivity, and the capability to power my TV with the remote, I bought this for master bedroom. Replaced an older Fire TV stick. So far, so good on this. Although I haven't really noticed better WiFi reception, but that could be my connection. I like both Roku and Fire TV products.

  I have a 2 year old 55"" Samsung Smart TV. My reaction to the Roku after using it for 24 hrs was ""WHY DIDN'T I GET THIS SOONER?!"" Samsung has one of the better smart TV softwares in the Tizen UI, but it does not hold a candle to the Roku. I recommend the Roku to everyone, even if you have a smart TV. Smart TV UI's can be laggy, hard to navigate, lack proper updates and app availability; whereas the Roku really shines. It is ZIPPY with a capital Z, no lagging. It has the most app availability of all platforms, and updates are constant and regular. The home screen is simple and easy to use. I wish I had bought the Roku when I purchased my smart TV, but I assumed I didn't need it, because after all- I was buying a smart TV. What I didn't know was that the Roku is much smarter.

  I have several Roku devices and this one has problems with the audio. While watching a program the sound will get a lot of static. Adjusting audio options does not help. The only way to fix is to do a system restart on the Roku.

  Worked as expected. I love but they added the volume control on the side of the remote for the TV that it is paired with. I hooked it up in my bedroom, which is quite a ways away from the Wi-Fi router so I couldn't plug the power source directly into the TV. I had to plug it into the wall, but I can't fault Roku for that though because the instructions said that that could happen the further you get away from your router, and it was right LOL.

  Worth every penny.1. It's a very easy platform to navigate, and see up is a breeze.2. Alexa integration is great. It does everything your other Alexa inabled devices can do. Also, being able to view your security cameras and smart doorbell from your TV is a nice perk.3. I would recommend it to anyone.

  For some reason it takes a while for Netflix and others to load and some shows only load to 24%, then stays there. My internet connection is fine on other devices so that's not the problem.  The volume also stopped working while using firestick.  Once I change over to dish, the volume is fine.  I do not have this trouble with my Roku.

I have never had an issue with WIFI signal in our home soI think this Stick has failed.I have tried to communicate this problem to Roku rep ""Prawinraj"" but have been unable to get a replacement under warranty.

  Love it.  $50 on BF you can't beat it.  Cant' beat it at full price either.  THIS is the gold standard for streaming sticks.  Crystal clear picture, intuitive interface, fast, 4K HDR and IR blaster in the remote.If you just need 1080p then the 3800 stick is probably the route you should go but I plan on buying a 4K TV next year and since it was the same price on BF why not?

  The Roku stick is awesome. I have a vacation home in a rural area without cable. We use Hughesnet for internet service and this device works great. I have cable service at my other home and I can see some of the channels I subscribe to like NBA League pass and don't miss a game. We would recommend Roku to everyone that would like to watch something other than regular tv. It is easy to set up. We are seniors and not very tech savvy and we set it up within a few minutes.

  Took over 2 weeks around Xmas for support to reply to me and another couple weeks to close the ticket after I told them I figured it out in my own. Hopefully that was just a time of year thing. Also it crashes about one a week, on random apps (Hulu, Disney+ etc not crap ones).

  These have been great gifts for work. Everyone that has received one is ECSTATIC to own one. I'm happy about this newest version because it supports up to 4K with HDR. This stick provides any TV with an HDMI port the chance to become a ""Smart TV.""I own a Smart TV and the OS on it is not as robust or fast as these standalone devices.I wish it had some hard line Ethernet capability but most people do not have that available near their TV.

  I've had Roku devices for over 10 years and they continue to be amazing.  I have smart TVs, but they are constantly having to buffer on Netflix, etc.  Yet when I use that same smart TV with my Roku - I have NO PROBLEMS STREAMING any service.  Their built-in wi-fi boosters are amazing.  I haven't yet used this in my travel trailer with camp wi-fi, but so far so good.  I refuse to use voice services on all devices so I have no opinion on this feature.

  Bought this specifically for the Spectrum app only to find Roku no longer offers it.  I wanted to give it fewer stars but realized that was due to my aggravation - This Roku did not do the one thing I purchased it for.  To be fair, and putting aside no Spectrum, this appears to be a very nice piece of equipment.  Installation went smoothly and it functioned very well.  I would have kept it and been very happy if I could access Spectrum with it.  Roku was returned and 1 star deducted for this reason.

  I love Rokus and have used them since 2011. Roku devices have enabled me to cut cable with the large and ever increasing cable bills. I got tired of having to pay for channels that I never watch.

  There is a known design flaw with Roku remotes that they are unwilling to admit. The remote drains batteries like crazy. I have replaced 4 pairs. This is is not a pairing issue.

Have tried to contact someone on the forum through PM, but lets see. Buyer beware...

  I prefer the Amazon Firestick interface hands down over this one.  The only problem with Firestick is the Spectrum TV app doesn't work with Firestick.  So I'm stuck with Roku.  It ok and works well.  I have no choice at this point.  Roku IS easier to do searches for channels.  I recommend but prefer the Amazon Firestick interface a bit better.

  I timely received this product.  I was having streaming issues with my regular Roku stick.  The Stick+ was the answer.  Better long range and WiFi connection.  Good processor on board the Stick+.  I have not had any more streaming issues since installing Stick+.  I cut the cord and use this to stream Internet video from subscribers with no problems.

  Fire is always giving low memory error. Roku is fine there. While I am glad there is now a mute button, it should be above the volume, not in the only area one can use to hold the device.

  We had a problem with it but after the cable company replace the router it streamed cable again.  It has to buffer occasionally which the live TV signal never did.  I suppose this thing is a good deal if you really like to stream content but I can watch everything I want at my desktop.

  Samsung 6200 does not detect the roku streaming stick +. Not sure why, but my guess is that the HDCP 2.2 on the streaming stick + is not compatible with the older HDMI on the TV.

  This is our second one of this model, and third ROKU stick. Could not be happier. They just work. We have a sound bar on the main TV so we use the older 3600R unit for that as controlling the TV and the soundbar via the Roku remote is not really possible. No big deal. But the other 2 TVs, we only ever use the Roku remote now for everything. Highly recommended.

  It was so easy to set up.  Someone suggested I set up my Roku account first. After that all I had to do was plug the Roku into the tv. Then plug the Roku into a power source. Then it had to type in my internet security password. Then added channels. Roku walks you thru everything! Easiest thing I have ever done. Wish I had done this sooner. I have so much to watch, I don't know how I will ever see it all! I have cancelled Hulu,Netflix, and Amazon Prime.

  I give this 4 stars because it wouldn't work without being plugged into my outlet. I have HDMI plugs on my t.v but it still had to be plugged in the outlet. Also doesn't work with my surround sound. Volume comes from t.v. only. Deciding on whether to return it at this time. Side note: Picture is clear and much better than when I had the Roku 3000x.

  I'm thrilled with this stick, it's streaming with no problems from a wifi connection my roku express wouldn't even detect at all, beyond that navigation is much, much faster and I love that the remote can turn the TV on/off and adjust volume, so I can actually put my TV remote away and just use this one.

  I love this thing. Setup was super fast, so easy to use it feels like I've been using it forever. My tv isn't a smart one but it is now! Voice search is cool and useful. I'm amazed that it programmed itself to the tv so the volume and power buttons on the roku remote operate it. If it had menu control it would be perfect. Feels like I got more than my money's worth so I def recommend it!

  This was a gift for my mother who absolutely loves it. She has not used the voice feature and does not have Alexa which is fine she has enough choices by using the remote. She is not as tech-savvy as some people, but this products works just fine for her. Would recommend for other less tech-savvy moms and dads it works great with very little instruction.

  Purchased this to use primarily with Youtube TV which we replaced cable with.  Compared to other devices we have on different TVs; the UI is a little slow to load the Youtube app and to get started streaming; but all in all for the price I would say this is very acceptable.

  Bought this in June of 2020, could not get to work on HD tv. It cost me 48.00 to get tech help to activate. Now every time we try to use we have to go through wi fi setup.

  Setup was a breeze and the usability is spectacularly easy. The wifi extender is useful and the always ON feature means the Roku is ready as quickly as your TV can turn on. Number of apps is pretty incredibly (haven't found an app to be missing that we wanted). The overall speed is great for a stick (no lag and loading apps is quick). Only minor note is there is no Amazon button, but cant fault a competitor for not applying a dedicated button for their app.

  So far so good! I'm using PlayStation Vue for my live TV and love it! Quick and friendly user database. Love the Roku app and being able to use phone as remote. Had to unplug Roku once to reset remote but was quick. Sling TV offers $50 credit and I'm comparing that to PlayStation Vue and it's also good but not as many live local channels. Highly recommend this Roku Streaming Stick Plus. Arrived quickly and no damage. Easy to install as well.

  I bought the streaming stick + because we went from having cable in every room to using Roku. I have had the Roku Ultra in the living room for 2 years and love it. The Streaming Stick + has all of the picture and streaming quality of the Ultra, without the DVR, earbuds, and ability to plug in an USB drive. The streaming stick + can also only get a signal through wifi while the Ultra can get a hardwire internet connection. The $40 price difference for the same performance without the unnecessary options sold it for me. I love the voice remote and the choices for channels is amazing.

  I used this on an older LCD TV and it works great.  It maintains a strong wireless connection with no buffering.

  I was liking the fact that I didn't have to manage a bunch of wires, but it turns out that the USB on my TV wouldn't power this, so I had to use the power adapter.  Other than that, it works very well and is about 50 feet from my modem, so that is a big plus.  I just wish one can turn it off and on so it doesn't have to be connected to wi-fi all day long.

  What a breeze! Compared to our antiquated Chromecast (maybe 5 years old?) the Roku stick is amazingly easy to use. No need to have a smart phone, tablet, or computer nearby-just plug it in and once you set the stick up (you do need one of the aforementioned items for setup), you do not even need the TV remote to turn the set on/off.  An unknown added bonus was the button that takes you immediately to Direct TV Now.  Only had the stick for two days, but might go out on a limb to say I like it better than my Apple TV!

  I've had the Apple TV for quite some time. I couldn't see the Live TV version of Hulu w/ my Apple TV 2nd generation - and had to upgrade to do so. After looking on the web and reading reviews, the Roku stood out as one of the best choices and at $80.00 less at that compare to the Apple TV 4th GEN. The set up was painless - programmed itself to control my TV - set up all it's internet connections itself, etc etc. I would buy this for my parents! ;-)

Setup was easy, it works great on my older LG 3D tv, that recently stopped support for HULU, prompting me to purchase(after reviewing the different Roku systems available, finding this one to suit my needs the best) this Roku, which now allows me not only access to HULU, but a host of other excellent stations. Worth every penny!

  It worked fine WHEN it works. I've only had this Roku for 2 months and had to replace the batteries twice. That's 3 sets of batteries because it came with a set and now the remote doesn't work at all. I contact Roku and they said they would send me another remote. Then in the next sentence they tell me the remote are on back order. Ugh!!! After ordering this Roku taken a month to find the best apps for me I canceled my DirecTV. Now I haven't been able to watch tv in 3 days because of a remote. SMH.

  Worst Roku I've ever had. The stick still has to be plugged in to a power source. It's grainy and very slow. Buffers all the time and my router/modem are right next to it. Loses volume and the remote quits working all the time. Apps have to deleted and reinstalled. I've had the original Roku, Roku plus, Roku 3 and Roku ultra. The stick is the biggest waste of money

  My first firestick stopped working after 4 months. It was a gift so I ended up purchasing one since I liked it. I enjoy it when it works properly, but I constantly have to get up and unplug the stick from the TV because of sound issues. Im on the second replacement. It seems like a common issue of you look it up. Had my Roku stick for 2 years with no issues.

  I have Apple boxes and remotes. The Firestick allowed me to get HBO Max, which was inaccessible on an older Vizio TV. The setup was easy. I did it with the instruction manual and didn’t need Amazon’s phone assistance. It’s small but has everything at your fingertips.

  Love this.  Only wish that when you power off the TV (which this does!) it would take the Roku to the Home screen.  If you turn off your TV without going home and are live streaming or are on a channel with autoplay, you will continue streaming even with the TV.  That can use up your bandwidth allotment pretty quick.  But other than that, love that this one controls TV on/off and volume, a truly one remote solution for cord cutters.

  Cut the cable long ago.  Roku is inexpensive and is very easy to set up and use with sufficient free tv & listening options like Pluto + access to pay options like amazon prime, netflix, et al.  If you're within distance of signals, get an antenna for local broadcast tv.

  Audio stops working no matter how many hacks I watch to repair it , I can't get it to turn back on.

  This stick works great.  I have a 4k on the wall tv, so the only drawback is that I have to leave where I am sitting to go to the tv and hit the remote in close proximity to the stick in order to get it to change from the first screen to the library of apps.  That is why I gave it 4 stars, but otherwise I love it.  So I get a little exercise.  So what.

  This is my 4th Roku (so I guess I really like them). I really love the ease of set-up and use. This one I use in a basement room with fairly dodgy wi-fi. So far, it works great. The only change I would make to the hardware is to ask that the male hdmi end be flexible. I have a tv that the length of the stick blocks it so I need to use a m to f adapter. Would I buy again? Yes.

  Well, if I could find a way to use it I would probably like it. Unfortunately, the Roku site says they would send a free HDMI extender in the booklet. I have tried since I bought it and they are always out of stock. My TV is older, 2007 and the stick won't fit in the back because it is a little cubby area. Why not just include them in the package? Or at least tell people you have to purchase more items to use. I can't even find a small one like they show in the booklet so it is still sitting in the box. Talk about frustrating. Not sure what to do now.

  We purchased the Roku Streaming Stick+ as our first step into a ""cable-free"" life.  It was a great decision.  We have been extremely pleased with the performance and content availability.  Selected this option as my TV was on a different level from my wifi router and I was concerned about speed and connectivity.  The extended range wifi capability of this unit has proven to be flawless.  We have had zero issues in 3+ months with streaming speed in HD.  Highly recommend this product and will likely buy another one for our 2nd TV.

  Worked fine for the first month.  Then the remote control stopped working and nothing would fix it.  I tried all the various instructions to reset it (removing batteries, pressing the reset button, etc.).

  I run a Plex server on a Synology NAS and was having transcode and bandwidth issues during 4K playback.

Youtube app also runs quicker on the Roku compared to the native smart TV app. Thanks, Roku.

  If I had known how easy this device would make cutting the cable, I’d have done it a really long time ago! This was an easy set up, plus I already have a roku premier that is in my living room, that I got about 10 days before, which made the sign in even easier. I love that the stick can be moved from tv to tv and you can wirelessly connect all your tvs. So glad I tried it!

  It can be unreliable and apps tend to not work well. It is cumbersome to navigate and the voice activated search is not up to par. I also have a 2nd Gen Apple TV and the amazon fire stick. The 2nd Gen Apple TV is so much better than both this stick and the Amazon fire stick. I got this to use with my TV in the study. Next time I will just spend the money and invest in another Apple TV.This Roku stock is so much better than the Amazon fire stick. You also don’t run the risk of having popular apps pulled (YouTube pulled off the fire stick by Google.)

  Love Roku. Simple interface without the Amazon commercials. Plus it has Vudu which I use frequently. The fire tv  products don't have apps it feels threatened by. It's much quicker than the FireTv products I own. In addition you  don't need to buy a sidecar accessory to control the tv.

  Totally love this product. Bought one a year ago and has made accessing app streaming such as Netflix, HBO +, Amazon Prime etc so easy and quick.  Easy to set up. If you get a Roku account, and if you change your channels on one device it also applies to the other device, so only had to customize with one of these. The only thing that didn't work so well was plugging into a usb to power. Worked at first, but then had trouble starting up. Easy fix, just plug the plug provided into a wall outlet, problem fixed. You won't be disappointing.

  Roku is great specially if you have reliable wifi and if you don't have a smart TV or gaming console to stream your video subscriptions. I did in fact have to buy a wifi range extender in order to not have any lag in streaming because my router is at the back of my house and my roku is in the front of the house in the living room. I have purchased other roku streamers, but I wanted to add this to my collection because it is great for traveling and it's perfect for hotel room TVs. Highly recommend.

  This replaces ones cable providers set top boxes and saves you money that can be put to use in other areas.  Great for us as retired and on a fixed income I'm only glad that I did my homework and since I'm retired IT Professional this was a breeze to setup.  It takes some getting used to but well worth the time and the savings!

  I've got one of these on each of my TV's. Love it so much better than the fire stick. Easy to navigate and never have connection issues. Only drawback is I wish I could sync up my soundbar for the audio. I don't use my TV speakers so it kinda makes that feature useless.

  My Samsung Smart TV needed to be repaired with a certain part.  It would not let me use the internet.  It would have cost about $170 to have the  part & be put in.  Someone suggested just buying a Roku & for $39 dollars I could stream everything I did when my smart/stupid TV was working!

  Easy to set up, easy to access, streaming is great!  I would recommend to anyone.  Note, plug into electrical outlet not USB port on TV - it makes a difference.  If all you want is easy streaming, this will do it.  Great picture.

  Easy to install and get setup. Only complaint I have is they say it connects to your tv so you won’t have to use your tv remote. But it’s missing an input button to change inputs and there is no mute button on my remote. You can change to the Roku input by pressing the OK button but you can’t change off of it that I have found. Would be nice to customize shortcut buttons but I know those companies pay to get their name there so that will probably never happen.

  The remote always lost connection to the Roku which was annoying so we ended up using our phones as a remote with the roku app. The user interface looks great but is very slow compared to the Fire 4K. I would not recommend this product because of those two things when the Amazon Fire 4K is so much better.

  They don't allow HBO Max app, because they want a cut from HBO's subscription fees. If you get HBO Max on Roku, you won't have access to all of HBO Max's content (like Studio Ghibli's productions such as Totoro or Spirited Away). Apple TV or Xbox allow that. This is because loyal customers like us have made Roku too greedy. Shame on them!

  These new generation remotes are made much cheaper and are very flimsy compared to my 3 previous generation remotes.  The new on screen interface is ok.  I have no interest in the voice recognition functions, so I am very disappointed that the remote creeks every time I press a button on it.

  Ive tried for hours now to activate this stupid streaming stick. I have many Rokus, but now, it seems as if the company may be having troubles. They don't answer their phone, they don't answer emails, their chat bot on their website is disabled. With a streaming stick, you are supposed to get a activation link sent to your email, that never comes. I am returning this. Beware- Roku may be going out of business. Don't buy!

  Good quality product. Good features, functionality. Cheaper than Apple TV, portable, better user interface than Amazon Fire products. The only noticeable downside is I lost Airplay functionality coming from the Apple TV, and the mirroring functionality on the Roku is sufficiently glitchy that it almost never works for me. Even when it does, I can't stream website videos from a mobile device unless I want to use a questionable 3rd party app/channel offered on Roku's app store. Still though, everything else is really great.

  We went from the express which works great, but we were hoping that having the stick would provide better quality and versatility.  The picture quality and streaming ability is good, but the remote loses its connection and forces us to move the TV out to unplug the power from the stick in order to get the remote to work again.  Our other Roku boxes never had a problem with the remotes.  Good Item, but the remotes are not worth it.

  I had a Roku in the past and loved it, but this one barely works if it’s power source is the tv. I suggest you do not use the usb option for power. Plus, I have to use my Roku app as a remote. The actual remote only works 50% of the time.

  The product arrived on time and immediately I realized I had ordered the wrong thing. I don't see the point of owning a firestick with a remote that doesn't control your TV. It was a waste of money. Upon plugging the fire stick up it didn't even work. It resets every 5 Seconds. I've spent two hours being disconnected from customer service just trying to get a refund. I'm very disappointed

  It does not work. It does not connect to any apps and shows the loading screen for each app but never can play a show. When I tried to get Amazon support I was told to unplug it and plug it back in so many times it is actually funny. It’s just a faulty product and Amazon does not care to rectify. A waste of money, try chromecast or roku.

  the streamer is great (!) but it does has a few problems to take into consideration when picking a streamer:1. No official support for Hebrew or for Israeli channels.2. unique interface (not an android device), so many apps are non-compatible to it.3. additional connection to the electricity is required on many TV sets that have insufficient power outlet from their USB port. (adds wires wondering about the house).4. needs very stable internet connection (tried using hotspot from a number of cell phones and it didn't work.

  Having a Roku in addition to a smart TV is a little redundant. The remote control is also buggy at times...

  The original HD streaming stick was already good, but this one is even better is that it can also do 4K videos and streaming. The remote is also better is that it can aim anywhere and still operates the channel.  Funny thing is, it also turns on my TV in the other room.  How powerful is that? Not sure if that's a feature or...anyway, get this thing.  You won't regret it.

  So much better than Amazon Fire Stick/Fire TV; because it doesn't limit what apps you can run it. It doesn't try to force their own programming on you.  Works great with YoutubeTV, VUDU, and Netflix.  4K and HDR works great as well.  Remote is convenient because it will control the volume on your TV or through your amp or sound bar (if using one). It will also turn your whole set up (TV, AMP, Soundbar) on and off.

  Things I love:1. On and off button on remote2. Volume control on remote3. Voice command using microphone on the remoteI have both Roku and Firestick. Roku wins. We couldn't use our FS a lot because of Amazon's squables with other companies, which lead to us not being able to use things like YouTube tv and YouTube. I love my Roku.

  Got this for a nice TV that doesn't have wireless. Roku worked right out of the box. No problems with creating a Roku account, no issues connecting to wireless. Steamed Netflix 30 minutes after I opened the box. Everything you need to steam is in this box.

  Very easy to install, modest price. Voice control only calls up applications, not specific items within a application (Ex: Youtube is application, specific video is item within Youtube). Voice control is future for this device....where is it Roku???

  I bought this for use in the United Arab Emirates.After setting it up, I was able to set up Netflix and YouTube, but nothing else of use.Prime video is not available on Roku here (even though I can access it on my other devices), and the ""search channel"" option is completely disabled.When I contacted customer service, their last suggestion was to use the decide in the USA tp enjoy its full capabilities.... Sure, I'll just change countries.I should have spent the money on a chromecast or a cheaper android based media player.Can't return it, it'll cost too much to return.

  This is my first experience with a device like this. After finding out my older blueray player won't support prime and netflix any longer, I bought the Roku. I am amazed at how much I was missing from trying to use the old blueray. The Roku is very easy to navigate. No extra advertising. No fuss setting it up. In fact, I still switch off to the old player to watch family DVDs and play some favorite cds. Its just that easy! Love it!

  I loved the Roku Streaming Stick at first -- the install was easy, the picture and sound was outstanding. But after about a month it began failing. No picture, no sound. Sometimes it would work, but it progressively got worse. Now it does not work at all and it's too late to return. It went from one of the best purchases I've ever made to one of the worst.

  I like the idea of a streaming stick, however the one I received is defective and my window for return was only 30 days. It took that long to get in touch with anyone by email or chat. Support for the ROKU products are nonexistent. The streaming stick overheats, throws errors and has to be unplugged and reset daily and still freezes up.

  I don't really know how to rate this Roku because clearly it's defective. I have a Roku 3 and I absolutely love it.  I got a great picture with this and I love the voice remote control however the audio kept cutting out on me so I had to return it.  If not for the audio issue I would say it's fantastic. I'm going to get another one and see what happens and then hopefully  I will be changing my rating to a five, if the audio issues no longer exists.

  I currently use Chrome Cast and my PS 3/4 but decided to give Roku a try and purchased a refurbished one which saved me about $10. This has to be the worst refurbished item I have ever received. Right out of the box it is disgustingly dirty and all scratched up. I get that it's not new but one would expect at the very least a cleaned product. I wouldn't even give it away in it's current condition. You've got to wonder about a company that would give a dirty product to customers. I cannot attest to it's functionality as I'm likely going to return it.

  So far so good, so much faster and no buffering like my 2017 firestick.I have( 4k) firestick in the bedroom works great. I tried using the $25 off code for firestick this holiday season and it wouldn't let me use it, so went to Roku. Glad I did!

  This is my 3rd roku stick, bought the smaller $35 ones previously, but was intrigued with the wireless claim, well it worked great, compared it to my previous ones and it lived up to its claim of extended wi-fi and faster speed.Will buy another and would definitely recommend.

  I bought two of these to replace my expensive cable setup, and I've been very happy with them. Set up was easy and straightforward, and the remote and menus are simple and user-friendly. Being able to watch live TV on PSN and videos on Youtube on the same device is very handy and something that wasn't possible with cable. This is a good low-cost option for cord-cutters.

  Reason for 4 stars was I got one that proved to be defective.  It kept looping back to Start over and over.  Used website support and after trying all the options, the answer was defective.  Used Amazon's Return and Swap for another.  The second one works fine.  No looping.

  Much faster and with a superior interface and remote, I am enjoying promotional offers and actually cancelled my satellite TV. Depends on internet speed of course, but overall great (my provider, Windstream, SUCKS). You will love it too. Lots of free TV, too.

  The extended WiFi range is what makes it worth spending the extra money to buy the + version.  Even the cable guy that came to my house for a service call was amazed.  It makes a big difference over the standard stick and I highly recommend it!

  I loved my new updated fire stick. Until it would not connect with my wifi. I woke up to watch tv and it will not connect back to my WiFi. It says strong signal but connection error.

  A lot of value for the cost. Small size fits directly to my HDMI port, with an option to get a free HDMI extension from Roku if it doesn’t.A surprising number of free channels (with tolerable Ads) plus the ability to link your premium channels.You may need to upgrade your router - we were good with our ASUS RT-AC68U but check yours.  Also, we are able to stream with a low 3Mb data rate / low end internet service - maybe lucky for us but it consistently works fine.Finally, we were so happy with the first one, we bought a second - and still pleased after 6 months of use.

  We have Dish but my wife's TV is connected via wireless to the Hopper so it wont bring up Netflix. The Roko was the answer since it goes directly online to connect to Netflix. The TV is just set to the HDMI port connected to the Roko and the rest is just following the instruction.

  Roku streaming stick + is a great little box for a very decent price.  The only thing to know is that most of what you want to watch costs extra money for subscriptions to hulu, amazon prime, netflix, HBO etc. I guess naively I thought there would be more interesting shows I could watch without paying for additional subscriptions. So I will invest in a few subscriptions, seeing as teh box itself comes with a few things but nothing I really care to watch.  But now at least I can watch TV and shows seeing as I did not have more do i want cable tv.

  I have used several Rokus on TVs that don't have the ability to add the YouTube TV app. (It is annoying that Samsung ""smart"" TVs that are only a couple of years old don't allow this.) I have now cut the cord on Comcast for cable and am saving thousands of dollars a year. It takes a little while to get used to the change but we have not looked back once with regret. I actually like the Roku interface better than the interface on Apple TV and on newer TVs that have YouTube TV already on them. We don't use Roku for much else other than YouTube TV, Netflix and Amazon Prime.

  Purchased for my daughter for college dorm room and this little stick is awesome.  Instant ability to connect to all your subscriptions and able to stream in local stations.  She loves it and nice way to take a break from studies especially with strict pandemic rules for students.  Ease of use is fantastic and simplistic.  Easy to set up and remote is intuitive and has nice feel to it.  Would recommend to anyone who does not want to pay for cable/satellite tv.

  It’s your standard Roku setup. Only took a minute to hook up. I like that I don’t need to connect it to power to work. Unfortunately we have an off brand tv that doesn’t work with the remote, so we still have to use 2 separate remotes, which is annoying. That’s really my only gripe so far.

  For the first week I had this item everything was fine. Then all of a sudden it kept dropping from the Internet. I have real strong Wi-Fi and my Wi-Fi modem box is right next to it. When it drops the Wi-Fi it takes a minute it restarts and then it’s frozen and you cannot use it. I would not recommend us it’s a waste of money!

  I got this product because my Vizio tv can’t seem to get Disney Plus and the built in Hulu app has basically become dysfunctional. The Roku stick solved both those problems for me, plus offers several additional apps, runs very fast and is overall a very easy device to use. The remote is nice too and I especially love how it can control volume and tv power, which allowed me to put away my original tv remote. Highly recommend this product, especially to those with older smart TVs that have outdated apps or better yet even dumb TVs

  We purchased Roku as we needed to convert one of the regular Tv’s at home into a smart tv and watch Netflix. It took only fewe minutes to install and connected immediately to wifi connection. We are very happy and satisfied with ROKU. The only reason I don’t give the 5 stars is because the function of voice recognition doesn’t work, but we think it is because the tv is old generation.

  I’m not sure if this is user error, or a device error, but the volume doesn’t work 50% of the time on one of our TVs. I constantly have to unplug the fire stick for at least 60 seconds to get it to work again which is frustrating. Never have to do this on the other two TVs so maybe it’s just our tv? Otherwise seems to work nicely.

Often the remote wont work at all even with fresh batteries until i remove them and reinstall them.  Very disappointed.

  I travel a lot for work and try to go the cord cutting route. I have accounts for most streaming services, but to be able to screen mirror to non-smart tv's is a blessing. Typically I would attach my laptop with an hdmi rendering my pc useless. This helps in so many ways and has made my life so much easier. the user interface is very good and being able to speak into the remote to find something has been working well for me. Love the product.

  This replaces a fire stick (2nd generation) to correct wifi connection issues. It works great and has additional free apps that we are enjoying. It does not have an internet app which we use to stream from websites. Also the mute button is on the side so I’m constantly accidentally muting but not a big deal.

  There is no headphone jack on the remote like the previous version I miss that. The previous version fit perfectly in your hand I don’t know why they changed it you will really notice a difference if you’re used to the old one

  I’ve had this roku stick+ for about a week now, and it’s great! The picture quality isn’t superior to my cable channel quality. Super easy/intuitive to use and I like that I can download the roku app/use my phone as the remote. It will initially say the power is too low when plugged into my TV, but in about 30 seconds it’s charged up and ready go. I haven’t had any issues with it going out even when watching a full length movie!

  I like it a lot but I don't like the new remote...too many unnecessary buttons (my flat screen TV remote has too many buttons on it, too, so...).  However, the buffering problems I had before are gone, and it was an easy install for a dummy like me, so (all in all) I'm very happy with it.

  The Roku Streaming Stick+ is just what I've dreamed of - so long cable boxes.  These are so good I put them on all my TVs.  The ability to power on/off the tv and control volume is terrific.  It even controls one if my old TVs when neither satellite or cable controller could do it.  My biggest complaint is the cost for the plus.  Drop the price and these are the only tv/streaming device you'll use.

Also their are games she downloaded for free that she loves to play! Definitely recommend.

  Everything works great, but the internal microphone arrived broken. The button to bring up the listening part works, but the mic obviously doesn't work. Too bad, because otherwise this is a great item. The volume and power buttons being included on the remote itself are fantastic. Much easier than needing the actual TV remote as well. Aside from the disappointing mic being broken upon arrival, it's a great product.

  Im very happy with this product. The imagery is sharp and clear and the content seems to load pretty fast too.

Setup was pretty simple and everything switched over from my other gen 1 firestick.

  Roku does not charge you for activating the device, no matter how many other Rokus you have. There are fraudulent websites out there that will charge you. Just be sure to go to the legitimate website: roku.com/link

  This is my 3rd Roku it is how we watch tv. I got this one for our living room because of the volume and power for the tv so we only have to use one remote .I love it, the only problem is this bad boy eats batteries about a set every 2 weeks so stock up.. It will pop up on the screen and let you know they are low I put a set out but only change them when they die. Even with that fact I will be getting one for the bedroom.

  Just had only the streaming stick but had to make sure the inferred box pointed toward the remote.  This one is hidden and the use of the wifi makes it easier to use as well as it controls some of my TV actions (sound/CC).  Would get this one or try another upgrade if I had more tv's.

  I bought two of these. One of them is working amazing the other the remote keeps not working. I have changed the battery 3 times now. The only thing that works is re-linking the remote everyday, which is a nuisance. You have to take out the batteries and unplug the power to the stick to reset it then reconnect it and put the batteries back into the remote.I do like the streaming application itself. It is very user friendly and easy to personalize. However, I am considering returning it due to the remote issue.

  I have one of these on 2 different tv's and the picture goes blurry constantly.  Also, the remotes tend to not work all the time.  Same thing happens on both tv's, which are different manufacturers, so I know it's the Roku.  If it weren't for needing the spectrum app, I would've just stuck with the Firestick.

  Really like the features of this stick. Using it on a Vizio tv and I like that I can turn on and off the tv and control the sound from the remote. I also like that if I press the home button it will switch to the hdmi port without my having to find my tv remote to do so. It immediately gives you the best picture quality your tv can handle. It is also very fast.

  I’ve got this, and I already had the google chromecast, and the fire tv stick so far it’s so much better, and if you have an alexa in your room, you don’t even need to use the remote control to turn it on/off the TV. It’s just a bummer that you’re not able to control the volume with alexa or even the Fire stick remote control.

  Picture quality is great. Unfortunately it seems like this version has a glitch that causes the video and audio to fall out of sync frequently. They need to be restarted in order to resolve the issue. I purchased two, and this is happening with both, but isn't happening with other models of Roku that we have.

  We set these up when our cable was installed after I move on June 2. One of the three quit working a week ago. We have replaced the batteries, we’ve reinstalled everything and it still will not work. Not sure why this one doesn’t work and the other to do. Disappointed we cannot figure it out. They only last for two months I’m hesitant to buy another one.  Also cannot get the pause or fast forward etc. to work.

  I love the Roku Streaming Stick +.  I had previously been using a Samsung Blu-ray dvd player for streaming until it would no longer support the HULU app.  The Roke is a vast upgrade.  It streams so much faster than my older dvd player.  Also, the image quality is greatly improved as well.  The only thing that I am not sure is that useful is the voice feature, which I think might be better on the Amazon cube.  It only seems to work in very limited context.  But, the price for the Rodu more than makes up for that drawback.

  I like it when technology outperforms my expectations. I've tried a lesser model of Roku and had a bad experience, but this one is a step in the right direction. It just flat-out performs well for just a little stick. Makes the sucky internet I use seem less sucky (ATT is the worst).

  Used this with my old 2003 13"" Sharp 720p with RGB inputs.  Used a HDMI to RGB convertor to connect to the stick, followed the instructions, and my old dusty Sharp was out of the closet and running again.  Great, and inexpensive way, to give up to date touch to old tech TV.

  This is my third set and this one is horrible. I have a hard time with the remote control. Sometimes it works great and sometimes it doesn't. I have changed and reset the remote and the USB and doesn't work. The other ones work really good but I really don't know why this one is bad.

  I like this a lot mainly because it's so easy to stream movies especially from my phone. They really made this user-friendly and easy to setup. My only reason for not giving it a full 5 stars is because sometimes the Roku cuts in and out with the audio because (not exactly sure why yet) but I believe it's because it has trouble trying to adapt to my speakers. Other than that, I would highly recommend this.

  This product didn't work due to a faulty remote. Reported it to Roku with whom I spent considerable time troubleshooting the issue. Bought another Roku and everything uploaded/downloaded perfectly. Tried to return item, however, family emergency prevented following up with a return item procedure. So, stuck with a non-working device. Very disappointing.Not the first time I've had quality issues with purchases. Grandson very disappointed in robot purchased a couple years ago, though he didn't tell me right away, so was stuck with that too.

Terrible support from this company.

  Just upgraded from a previous generation that doesn’t support 4K. I wanted to try this one because when I stream on a Plex server into my basement it will sometimes pause and have to rebuffer.  Netflix works fine in my basement, but on a Plex server when you’re trying to stream 20 megs a second… That’s a different story. I honestly didn’t believe that the suppose it four times more range that they’re busting would be sufficient, but it has worked flawlessly for me, which I am really happy with. I have had zero issues with this device, and I can definitely say the range is much better than the previous generation

  We love our Roku. The reason I am writing this review is because the remote that came with it no longer works. We have only had it for about 7 months. I have had other remotes that work for years and years. Unfortunately, without a working remote the Roku is worthless. Disappointed that it went bad so quick and not sure why.

  Solved the problem created when apps on an otherwise perfectly good smart TV and Blu Ray player are suddenly no longer supported. At least now the apps live on one device which is cheaper to replace should that scenario happen again. The Roku itself works great and has a nice user interface. Haven't used the voice feature however so can't comment on that. Glad I bought it.

  Worked for 5 months and then stopped connecting to wifi. Wifi issues started a couple months ago but would usually reconnect after a few hours. My much older Roku Stick still works fine but is much slower. There is an issue with the new sticks that Roku needs to fix. Unless the roku is connected to wifi the remote freezes and mostly will not respond to normal commands. Unfortunately Roku makes the process of receiving a replacement under warranty very difficult and not free. No longer a product I will recommend.

  Careful folks, this is not your Grand Fathers Roku. What was once a stable, well respected, class leading device has turned into a completely unstable, crash prone, piece of junk. When it works I give it a full 5 stars. Sadly that is about 2 hours out of a 24 hour day. My Streaming Stick + is constantly crashing/freezing. If it's not the remote, it's the device, if it's not the device, it's the remote. Need to unplug and reboot min 3 times a day. And I heard such great things about Roku before buying. Also, their support line is USELESS.

  I bought this unit to replace a (Roku) 3 on a wall mounted tv. The (Roku) 3 was moved to a different tv. The new Roku is excellent. Small size perfect for wall mount tv. Great WiFi reception. Finally able to control both Roku and tv with one remote. Less clutter! The processor speed seems faster than the roku3 . Overall for the money this is amazing technology and very glad I purchased it.

  I bought this to hook up an older tv to my Prime video and Youtube tv.  Even though Roku doesn't advertise Youtube tv, I found and downloaded the app in their app store and linked it to my account. Now the old tv is a smart tv.  and all on one roku remote or voice command.  Haven't tried to hook it up to Google Assistant yet.

  You get what you pay for this one is awesome I have another Roku stick that works great also. That one is in my living room and bought this one for my bedroom. It’s far from router so would kick off with amazon fire stick the internet. This one has better built wireless which is awesome. It has never dropped the signal and zero problems so far. None it’s amazing can’t say the same about the amazon stick. This one really is worth the money.

  I've owned my Roku Stick+ for a little less than a year (bought in October 2018).The Roku appears to enjoy randomly factory resetting itself, requiring me to go through the entire Roku reconfiguration, re-logging into accounts, reconnecting subscriptions to the Roku device, etc. etc.Overall, not an enjoyable experience. Would prefer a more stable system. Would not recommend this product to friends or family.

  Absolutely terrible product! I will not buy a roku device of any kind anymore. I bought this product to replace my fire tv cube that is having issues connecting to the internet. I could not even use this product! It was saying the device couldn’t connect to the internet, even though I was typing in the exact correct password every other device is connected to. Didn’t even get to use this product for a couple minutes without realizing how horrible it is.

  I had an old Roku Stick that I have given away, and now this Streaming Stick + seems much better to me. The ability to control the power and volume of my TV (a Sony bought more than 6 years ago) is an excellent extra, the quality of video seems better too. I tried to feed it only with the USB cable, but it is preferable to use the electric cable that it brings.

  Remote control stopped working after 2-months and is not covered by their very limited (30 day) warranty.  New batteries were inserted but not a single button on the remote control works.  Hopefully, the manufacturer can rectify this by sending a new remote. I expect devices to last longer that 2-months.

  Amazing device, especially when you consider the small form factor.Sometimes it has issues with stalling and freezing. Like, sometimes at random, upon opening YouTube TV, I’ll have to hit the home button, and it’ll act like it crashed and did a mini-reboot.

  Installed two cartridges.  Printed a couple of pages and then printer failed to work.  Followed all of the troubleshooting recommendations and not solved the problem.  Uniwork really needs to resolve the issues before putting this product on the market.  Too much trouble to mess with returning for the price paid.  I will consider it tuition on using non branded products.  I also will never buy another espon product.

  There's nothing really wrong with this product except for the fact I obviously you can't turn the TV on or off of it or use the volume control and clearing the cache and data on apps should go back to the way it was not where you could only do it partially and this product should only be $17.99 when It was on sale months ago that price should stay the same

  I can access Prime and Netflix subscriptions, plus youtube and many other apps both paid and free.

  Roku won't tell you which TV this thing won't work with.  Look at the picture that came up on my LG.  Call them ahead of time with your model info and see if they'll tell you.  If you want to gamble, go ahead and buy it.  I wouldn't suggest that.  Roku's customer service is awful.  Why don't they list the models that don't work with this thing?

  These products have come a long way since several of the original models that I have had.. moves very quick and paired up with a 4K TV it gives a better image than my local cable vendor.

  This product would be great, if it worked. Immediately, the cord connecting it to the television went bad and the device kept overheating. Roku provided a new one of those. Then, less than 6 months after I purchased it, the remote totally stopped working. Roku refused to replace it. Definitely purchase a different product if you want it to last more than 6 months! TUpdate: the new power cord they sent also quit working. This product is garbage.

  I have the cheap one and the expensive one. I accidentally bought the cheap one thinking I was buying the expensive one. The downside is that it does not turn the tv off and volume up and down on the cheap one. I think the firestick is one of the only ones that streams slingTV a big plus. Stream quality is better then roku in my opinion.

  Perfect fix for any TV or HDMI capable device.  It ran a couple updates upon receiving it but setup was very simple, and worked flawlessly.

  Bought this to replace an old Roku that I was unsing in my basement for a high-def flatscreen that was constantly buffering and cutting out. This one works flawlessly, and picks up both of my wi-fi signals, one of which is a 5G (the old one didn’t). Thought I’d get the best one Roku had to offer, and I’m glad I did. A cheaper newer model of Roku might’ve worked, but I didn’t want to take the chance. If it didn’t work, I’d have to look into a wi-fi repeater. Only complaint is that remote does not have a mute button.

  This saved me hundreds of dollars!  When researching how to get internet to our travel trailer that's going to be parked on our side lot, we ran in to many expensive installation options for a new antenna, satellites or various hubs.  I invested in a wireless range extender and read that this Roku+ also has a powerful Wifi extender.  With the two combined, I have flawless Wifi connection in the R-Pod and can stream all our favorite apps using the Roku+.  The Netgear Extender is plugged in an outlet on my back lanai.  Works perfectly!  The Roku remote is super easy to use and the setup took less than five minutes.  Would definitely recommend!

If you have a 4K TV this will support it with the limited content we still have for 4k. It has every single streaming app with no limitations such as YouTube on the Stick and so forth. Highly recommended and you won't be disappointed.

  Model 3810R, as shown on Roku.com has a mute volume button.  Amazon shows a remote with a mute volume button, the remote I received did not have the mute volume button.  What I purchased and what I received was different as described.

  I got the Roku because my LG TV does not have the Spectrum App.  I did a visual and audio test with Netflix through Roku  Vs. Netflix App that came installed on my LG tv.Using the Netflix App through the LG content store was at least 20% brighter and sharper.I had plenty of  bandwidth and confirmed my HDMI ports were enabled for UHD/4K.  While UHD and 4K work on the Roku the picture is lacking.

  Great product. It has a HDMI extension cable if you need one. Very cool that I can just plug it in and ply in the usb to my TV to power it in lieu of using the usb plug that also is in the box. Very cool.

  This device has never worked properly. For whatever reason, the remote will always turn the tv on and off and adjust the volume but will not let me select any other options (most of the time) unless I walk directly up to it a few minutes after it turns on and aim it behind the tv. Once the cursor actually moves once then it works ok when I am in front of and away from the tv.  It is super annoying. I would have returned the item but got it during Christmas and it got overlooked.

  So incredibly easy to set up. I was also able to download the Spectrum charter app which brought on all my cable channels on to this device. I actually found that I like watching the cable app rather than my actual cable box the menu is more user-friendly.If u have a Charter Spectrum box..... Use this to watch your cable through the app for a different tv without a box

  Simple, easy to set up, gets great internet connection. I researched all Roku models and the Streaming Stick Plus is awesome. Hidden behind the TV without ugly wires hanging down, no reception problems so far. Super simple to operate, with the volume & on/off controls on the Roku remote, Love it. Highly recommended!

  Bought 2 of them for my Parents Room and for myself! And already have them Setup in the rooms, and they’re are 10 out of 10 for me! Good Quality Picture, High Quality HD Picture and Color!The BEST thing about it is the Quad Core Processor built into the device, Runs 4x faster and captures the WiFi signal stronger than any other streaming device! Very easy to install and setup. No more Cable Boxes or having an extra Remote for volume or turning off the TV! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!

  it is not great for voice recognition, but otherwise this is a great device.  I had misunderstood from the description that this device extended throughout the house so would work as one Roku for multiple TVs but that is not the case.  It is only for the TV it is plugged into

  Cutting cost on cable and purchased this. It is great! Love all the free apps and the purpose it serves. I honestly wish Roku would just upgrade their remote. The reason for the 4 stars is that the remote sucks! Voice recognition doesn’t work for all apps and there are no numbers. It is difficult to navigate certain apps with no number options. Only complaint. Other than that great purchase!

  Only used it for Apple TV+. Both the original roku stick and the replacement had a lot of issues with audio cutting in and out and occasionally video would pause too. My WiFi is fine, all of my other devices stream with no problem. I’ve seen this issue mentioned online about roku sticks as well. Deal breaker!

  Thank you Roku for being my scissors as I cut away from my cable provider. The simplicity of this little „thing“ is in one word „amazing „.So now I’m stuck having to buy more units, one for my living room, one for the bedroom, one for the office, the list of great installations goes on.Thanks Roku for simplifying my life and for saving me (literally) hi dress of $$$ by helping me cut the cable.

  La interfaz de usuario es súper rápida y fácil de usar. No tiene nada que envidiarle a ningún televisor con tecnología smart.

  I am very disappointed with this item.  You can not adjust the volume and to replace the remote with one that does adjust the volume it will cost more than I paid for the firestick.  I would not have bought 2 of them if I knew I could adjust the volume.  This remote does not control tv.

  The Fire stick did not work. I plug it it and you can hear the start up sound and even the  sound but there was nothing shown on the screen. I got an no signal on my tv. This was frustrating. I’ve tried everything thing I possibly know to get this stick to work but it would not respond.

  I was going to go back to cable and decided to try the fire stick first.  What a great savings.  I love the free tv, but I also decided to add prime which gives me a lot to watch for a lot less then cable.  Alexa was an added bonus!

  Lite version is just what I needed. If you have an extra/spare tv in other rooms, then this is just perfect option. It does not have tv power button but the tv can be in standby (power save mode) and now most TVs can be controlled from smart phone.  Not much manipulation of tv controls needed when you are watching tv, most manipulation are done under the fire tv stick.

  When my husband went to the link for the help website, he was charged $100.  It turns out that you should only buy from the Roku website itself, or through Best Buy.

  Very disappointed with this Roku. I have always used Roku since the early days and never had any problems as the product developed with the industry. This time, however, I got stung.

Can I send it back?

  Have had this since the end of November 2019. The stick WILL turn on when plugged in, but will only stay on for about 30 seconds. If unplugged from an outlet, it will not stay on at all, nor hold a charge! I would have thought it would last longer than 4 months, and now it is outside the return window. Buy something that is way more sturdy than this thing!!

  While watching Netflix, every time we watch a show, the TV screen will flicker with a broad line flickering across.  We switched thinking it was our TV, even a new HDMI cable, we removed the connection to the sound bar, we tried every thing!

  Could not get Language Selection screen during initial setup. Instructed to press pair button in battery compartment, which did not respond. Replaced remote and same problem. Changed router settings to eliminate interference and went through the same troubleshooting as before, did not work. To add insult to injury, Roku allows you the pleasure of paying shipping costs to return their defective product, which is almost the cost to purchase the defective product.

  Worked well for about an hour. I was hoping for a longer product life. After about an hour, it no longer recognizes its own “advanced wireless receiver”, I suppose because of a bad connector or inadequate shielding from interference. I see it’s a common complaint, but no solution offered publicly.

  Amazing streaming device!! I have the fire stick in my bedroom set up on wifi and always had problem with my direct tv now service constantly buffering, i ran speed test on my fire stick and found that I was only getting 5mbps through my wifi (none of my other devices have this issue). I bought this Roku because it had the external wifi set up and my issue has been solved. This new remote rocks too, i can turn my tv on and off and adjust the volume now. couldn't do that with the fire stick so i always had to keep 2 remotes handy. I looked into apple tv and nvidia shield as well and those are awesome too but for the price point and just using it in my room, I feel like this is the best value.

  I've had numerous Rokus, including Roku 2 and 3. I bought this one for our guest room as it is further from the Wifi. Actually, that's not true, I bought it to use in our RV, but then I realized that my old Roku 3 had a USB port that would play the movies I have on flash sticks taped from Playon in my RV. So I moved the old Roku 3 to the RV and put this Stick+ in the guest bedroom. Hooray!

  I now have 3 ROKU dreaming units,  They save me over $300.00 a year on Xfinity TV.  If you don't mind the download pause, it is great.  I would recommend it to anyone watching TV.  Be aware, it takes a little time to set-up.

  Everything works well with this firestick except the volume.  I have to constantly restart the firestick and unplug it from the HDMI port on my tv to get the volume to work.  This is a problem with several streaming services.  I believe the problem is the new version of the firestick does work well with my older TV.

  La integración con Alexa, sin embargo, no tiene control de volumen, supongo que es la versión que adquirí. Anteriormente estaba viendo una serie en Prime Video en el Móvil, pero ahora no la encuentro en el FireTv.Así mismo, no he logrado transferir de mi móvil al FireTv, que fue una de las cosas que considere.

  The product works like it's suppose to 3 out of the 4 days a week.I have to keep unplugging it to reboot it to get sound.Not a big deal but annoying.Not worth the Hasale of sending it back but just something to keep in the back of my mind when buying amazon products

  This worked for our purpose, which is to view our Wyze cameras on the tv. The reason for 2 stars is because the sound doesn’t always work and I’m constantly having to unplug and plug it back in. I should have sent it back and tried a different one, but I had already recycled the box.

  So I love this the Roku system. No problems with it! But I bought this one for the living room (kids tv) and in the pictures it shows Disney+ on the quick buttons. Got my order in and it was espn instead. Sent it back and they sent a replacement. This unit also had the ESPN button on it. Not happy about this don’t show every picture with Disney+.

  I still have a 720p TV, so I don't benefit from 4K or HDR, but the Streaming Stick+ definitely loads Netflix faster and more reliably than my old Streaming Stick did.Setup was easy, and I haven't had any problems to date.

  Well my LG TV did not have an APP for the Discovery+ channel. I purchased the firestick in order to get it and also was able to download a few others.

  I had high hopes for this product and it was either this or Apple TV.  All works fine when the remote works but it will not stay paired.  Tech support is almost non existent except for chat.  They sent me an hdmi extender and said this would fix the problem and it didn't.  It's always a fight to pair the remote and every time you turn the tv off, when you turn it on, it needs to pair again which again is a fight and doesn't always work.  I followed everything advised and the tech couldn't figure it out.  Their other fix was to download the remote app which isn't ideal.  Disappointed and returning to get Apple TV 4K.

  I love my Roku because it pulls all my channels together in one place. What I don't like, is that most of the channels you have to subscribe for or pay for. I was looking for an alternative to having a lot of money paid out every month to watch movies

  
"

  It does take some time to set up if you are using apps to connect to other services you will have to log onto their website and active using a code provided.  The remote is not the best, I have to press the power button several times to get the set on...and that's just a few inches from the set.  Picture quality is great.  Many options to choose from without the high cost of cable.

  No negatives. I've owned 3 earlier models of Roku and I'm happy to report that this one is easily the best. First, it was by far the easiest internet- & TV-connected device I've ever set up. Second -- and the reason I upgraded -- it responds very quickly to the remote. Channels open faster. The built-in microphone for searching for shows works well too. Roku, you've hit a home run with this model. Congratulations.

  The strong reviews for the 4K Ultra were not wrong. Everything about the Roku is as advertised and described. It works well; the built-in volume controls and fast access buttons (such as Netflix) save time. I’m happy now after a huge disappointment and loss of purchase cost with the Fire Stick as a result of the fight between Google and Amazon which led to Google killing YouTube on the Fire Stick.

  The system works fine - great, even! But the remote is agonizing.

  This stick is junk. It worked barely six months. At first we thought it was the remote that went bad. Roku sent us a new remote. It seemed to work for one day. After that we can’t get the Roku to respond to more than 2 remote button pushes at a time, and there is a ten minute lag before it will accept another one or two button pushes. We can’t use Roku because of this so we’ll just watch through our smart tv and toss the Roku in the trash.

  The OS is closed OS and no easy installation of third party apps. The navigation is so confusing and not all apps or VPN is supported. Better buy other Android based streamer like Amazon fire stick and you can install VPN too. People outside US don't buy it. Better go for fire stick.

  This unit fixed every issue we were having with our old Roku and then some. Love,love, love the volume control on the remote. My only problem, and it's not much to complain about, is that the remote is so lightweight that it's a little tough to handle - feels like it wants to squirt out of my hand. For the price, you can't beat it.

  Overall, I haven't had any issue with it, wifi range although it says it's extended, works as usual but let me clarify that this may relate to my poor internet connection. When it is on range it rarely drops, I haven't seen any freezes, there's a bunch of free channels with good stuff.Additional notes:If you're buying from Mexico don't expect many channels in Spanish, there are a couple but I don't think there are enough to keep you entertained.Si planeas usarlo en México, no esperes muchos canales en español, hay unos cuantos pero no creo que sean suficientes para que valga la pena.

  Replaced an older Roku that has been giving us issues. I can see that even though the old one was supposed to be 1080p, this one seems clearer to us. As before very easy to set up, walks you right through. The biggest plus is now I can control my tv power and volume from the Roku remote. And talk about easy set up. It asked a few questions and bam, its working. 2 thumbs up Roku!

  I think that rokus are great. I have three of them. The worst part about them is that the remotes are good for a little over a year and then they stopped working for some reason. At least Amazon sells about 99 different replacements. They should last longer than that.

  I purchased a Roku TV a few months back and we love it.  I decided to go all in with Roku and buy 2 additional Roku sticks so we can use them around the house.  They work great.  The interface is simple.  WE LOVE PRIVATE LISTENING so you don't have to hear the TV if for example your partner is asleep.

  I love this device! I got one for Christmas & loved it so much I bought another for my bedroom TV. It’s so easy to set up & use. The apps on my smart TV would buffer, not load, or just quit on their own. So far I haven’t had any of those problems with my Roku. It starts up quickly without any loading or connection issues (which I always had with my chromecast). I also love that this new model has a Disney+ button on the remote!

  These sticks are prone to overheating, to the point where it displays an overheating message. This is with the HDMI extension, so I'm not sure if there are any other solutions to get around this.

  My husband bought me a roku tv a couple years ago for Christmas and I love it. I love how easy it is figure out how to use and there are so many choices to choose from.  We then decided to get rid of our Directv service and get a roku streaming stick.  It is a great product.  Would recommend it to all my friends and family as an alternative to paying for cable or dish.

  Bought this to stream HBO max on my TV and use mirroring of my laptop / phone with Apple Airplay.Overall, it works very seamlessly and the interface is very easy to use.The best function of this stick over the others is that you don't have to point the remote at the stick. Additionally, I love the voice feature as it makes navigating the device very easy.

  Does great for fast forwarding pre-recorded shows but not so good for rewinding to a point that you want to watch again. I'm getting some pixelation regularly. I really like that the remote turns my TV on and off and controls the volume. It's fast to load.

  I used this for two months, and then it stopped working. While it worked, it did its job. Now it’s just a piece of useless plastic which clearly isn’t worth the price of a functioning streaming tool.

  
"

  We took the plunge and ditched our cable/Direct TV, it was getting so expensive.  Did research and found that Roku had the options and features that we wanted.  So easy to set up.  We love Roku and have not regretted the switch.The only negative thing I would say is the remote is kinda cheap looking and small.  Could be a bit bigger and more sturdier.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have two of these in my home and absolutely love them.  The non-IR remote makes navigating a breeze and the ease of having all my streaming services right at my finger tips is second to none.  The claim to better wifi reception with this model is definitely valid as my home is laid out in a way that makes it very long.  As a result the wifi signal isn't the greatest in the master bedroom.  With other streaming sticks/boxes and even smart tvs this has been an issue, but with the new Roku Streaming Stick+, we no longer have this issue.  We are able to stream 4K video to that room with no buffering or grainy video.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is a great product.  I have several Rokus and have been very satisfied.  The only downside is that this version of the stick is not supported by Slingbox, but I understand that is because Slingbox does not support 4K.  I don't have a 4K TV (yet) so I haven't been able to see how streamingo try that feature yet.

  If you lose your remote and still have the Roku app you’re good until the device or Internet gets disconnected then you are locked out and have no way to use the device and the replacement remote cost almost as much as the device itself

  
"

  Works very well, very easy to use. Only thing I would note here is that if it's having any difficulties with Wi-Fi, connect it to external power instead of the USB port on the TV. It definitely gets better range and a much more solid signal that way. I already bought a second one and am considering replacing a couple of my cable boxes (monthly rental fees from cable company) with these.

  Fantastic device! Strong wireless signal (wireless-ac) and never a hiccup. Also have the older Roku 3 and this is a fantastic upgrade!

  This is awesome! We were able to do away with a cable box (which allowed more room). We now have more channels with a cheaper cable bill. Our son loves the voice recognition.

  I'm one of those types who hates paying for Cable.  My kids, however, want *ONLY* CN and Boomerang; mom ONLY wants Food or Travel Network; etc..  For years I was looking for a way to cut my cable bill - no joy... until today.  This looked too good to be true.  When I first bought this, I started out disappointed.  The video quality was excellent, install easy, no additional Roku hidden fees, connects to Amazon Prime, NetFlix, etc., but when I first hooked it up Thursday, the Roku channels weren't all they were cracked up to be.  However, after a little on-line research this morning, I stumbled onto Slack and a HDMI antenna.  Signed up on-line for $20/month (+5 per additional channel set) on Slack and broadcast HDTV, I was able to get *all* the channels we normally get through cable!  Kids have been watching all morning long and COULDN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE!!!  Now I can cut back to basic Internet for $30/month, etc.  True happiness.  DISLIKES: It's not a seamless experience - you can't pick 'channels' and surf them up and down.  The remotes do have jump to buttons for Sling, NetFlix, Hulu, and Vue - just not the same.  As an upgrade, I hope they add a 'channel surfing' feature where you can select which channels you want to surf.

  I own a number of Roku devices and with the exception of the older slower model(s), I have had great experiences with them. Due to my experiences, I have continued to upgrade to newer models as they become available. I am now using my new Roku Stick when I travel instead of my old first edition fire stick. I prefer having the same interface when I am at home, camping or in a hotel.

  We have used AppleTV for years and are actually happy with it until we purchased Roku. This stick surprised us by it's simplicity and versatility.

  It’s a ROKU, what more needs to said. It’s a snap to install. We recently bought a third TV and it now has a ROKU attached. Streaming is very good. Could not ask for anything more.

  Bought a 4k TV, needed a 4k Streamer.  The only drawback in my opinion is the power is no longer wall power, because the power-cube/power-brick is so large, it gets in the way when I push my tv back to the wall.  So I'm stuck with the onboard USB power, which means I have to wait for the stick to boot every time I fire up the tv.  In the non-4k model, the power cube was smaller, so it fit behind the tv.  Other than that, the quality is great, the remote works perfect, and the quality is perfect.

  Was working great and very clear picture but after 2 weeks the remote control stopped working for the roku stick features but it works fine to control the TV and audio surround sound. Clearly a defective product.

  We have a smart tv in our living room and got this for our den. It works ok. The tv is older so we have to use the power cord to plug it into the wall which makes it not as portable.

  I love that the Roku Stick+ has so many new and improved features over my last Roku table top device.  Not just by size but by features (can preview material on Netflix by just hovering over it, the remote can power on/off both TV and Roku, plus the remote controls TV volume without any complicated setup.  I've had older Roku Sticks and table top models of Roku but this is by far my favorite.

  Plug and Play.  I have 3 of these devices and this one is my favorite.  Since it plugs directly into the TV, out of sight with no connectivity issues.  Latest Roku features as well.  I would buy again and might for other TVs.

  Sorry Amazon, Roku rules as far as streaming devices go, not that the Firestick is bad it's just not as good as the Roku!!!Power On/Off and Volume Control is a HUGE plus for me.Ease of navigation, Roku has this one way figured out.

  I prefer this model over the ones that you have to point straight at the sensor.  My one issue is that from time to time the remote loses connection.  Somehow my kids figured out that if it isn't working, they go up to the back of the tv, hold the controller close to the Roku and press the home or OK button, and once it recognizes, you're good to go.

  This Roku streaming stick+ is a replacement for a defective one.  The first one only lasted a short time and now this one has burnt out.  I do not want a replacement, just wanted to let you know these are probably defective from the start.  I will eat this one and buy one elsewhere.

  I had a Roku 2 XD from quite a few years back and I absolutely loved it. However, recently it seemed to keep crashing, even with a strong wi-fi connection. I figured it was time to upgrade, and I'm glad I did. The streaming stick+ was just what I wanted, and was ridiculously easy to start up. Took about 2 minutes and it was up and running. All of my apps work flawlessly now with no crashing. Glad I made the choice to pick up a newer model. Hopefully it has the same lifespan as my previous model. Highly recommended for ease of installation, navigation, and picture quality. Also connects to the tv volume/power which is really convenient!

  The streaming stick is much faster than our old Roku box. We don't have to do anything to our TV before just pressing the OK button to instantly bring up all the Roku options. The only thing we don't like is that, when using the voice option to bring something up, it doesn't always recognize what we are asking for.

  Roku must have an agreement with Spectrum & Charter cable service company. the stick will not allow me to stream from my main home account when I travel to our second home. I was told that it would allow me to do so, but it does not. This is the ONLY reason that I wanted the stick, otherwise it is useless to me. I will be returning the product.

  I love this Roku stick especially being able to move it from one tv to another.  Picture is great.  I even tried it on my portable tv and had no problem. Originally had a Roku Tv but gave it to a family member.  One thing it offers that the fire tv stick doesn't is the cable provider app that allows access to the channels I get on my cable box on the tv that doesn't have a box on it.

  We switched off cable and this has been a great way to still access our streaming services like Netflix, Disney, Amazon Prime and Pandora. Very easy to set up and use. So much more economical than our outlandish cable charge each month.

  I now have 3 roku's for 3 separate rooms and I love them. The only slight downside is that for the initial setup it takes some patience to enter username and password with the remote but that is only on setup and the ease of use after that makes it more then worth it.

  For us Tech challenged users, installation was simple. In under 5 minutes we were streaming. The updated remote makes using this device easy.  Sound and picture are great. We did need to use the provided electric cord as we have an older TV.  Highly recommend.

  I replaced an older roku express with this.  The express model was right on the edge of having a good enough wifi signal (was experiencing intermittent buffering). The improved antenna on this model eliminated that issue.  Additionally, browsing the menu is much snappier.

  Because these were gifts and haven't been hooked up yet, I can't rate the performance of the items. The transaction, however, went well,was correct, was efficient and was delivered very promptly, and my own Roku device has been excellent so I expect no issues with performance. .

  My older ROKU (read 5-years old) was having problems staying connected to WIFI. This solved that challenge immediately. Very easy to set up. Picture quality definitely improved. Added bonus, is power switch that syncs with my screen. This eliminates one whole controller in my set-up. Does not have earphone jack in controller like my other ROKU, there is a higher priced model that does.

  This is the BEST! I have been using ROKU products off and on over the years, but this latest one with voice search is super and glad I purchased it.

  I bought two new Roku Streaming Stick+.  One of the roku's, when turned on, shows a night-time image with flashing screen.  It has to be powered off and powered back on a 2nd time to work.  When it powers on the 2nd time, there is a 30 second delay in the remote working.Roku Streaming Stick + #2 seems to work ok, but there is also a 15-20s delay in the remote working properly upon powering on.  The voice control would be good if it worked with all installed apps. ... but it doesn't appear to (could be user error).  But overall, there is a problem with both of them and it kinda sucks and I'm probably going back to satellite television.

  Love Roku interface. I have a couple other versions. I love the upgraded remote with tv controls. So nice not to deal with 2 remotes just to turn the tv on/off for control the volume. Replaced my spectrum tv box with the roku for streaming and have had no issues at all.

  I was ready to dump my 2007 flatscreen cos i wanted to get a smart tv. Luvky for me i was at a friends house and the UPS guy came around and delivered one while i was waiting.

  Great when it works but pray you don't need support.  Bought one on Amazon and three more directly from Roku.  Inside of about two months, one of the newest batch of three quit working - I filed a support ticket online and was emailed a support ticket number and told that I'd be contacted in the next 24 or 48 hours... It's been a week now and I've made additional attempts to get a response using the support ticket number.  Crickets...

  5 stars with this setup but a word of advice: The remote drains the two AAA batteries within one month on all three of my roku devices.  To avoid this you have to change the privacy voice settings.

  Works well with Xfinity Comcast, but voice commands do not work at all.  You have to manually search.  I got another one only because the volume buttons are included on the remote, and did not want to use 2 remotes for viewing pleasure.

  
"

  Honestly I love the product but it’s so FRUSTRATING. The cord for one is very shirt, and my biggest issue is the plug. Both prongs are the same size and since I have to run an extension cord to use the roku it is constantly falling out of the plug. If it had prongs of two sizes this wouldn’t be an issue . Instead it’s a constant pain.

  Updated 1/9/2018:  The remote started going wonky....some buttons would work one day, not work the next, and I would get some type of error the next time I used the included remote after using the Roku app's remote. Also, this Roku streaming stick+ will not work with the older remotes, such as those that came with the purple Roku LT.  So back it went.***********************************************It's nice to finally get 4K on my Sharp Aquos TV, which was purchased in 2015 (check your model, not all 4K TVs are HDCP 2.2 compatible). That's the only way you're getting true 4K streaming. This replaced a Roku 3 which wasn't made for 4K streaming.I'm also getting better streaming with PlayOn which used to do quite a bit of loading while streaming. Not due to my internet speed because all other streaming is top-notch quality with no lagging. From where my router is located, wireless had to go through 5 walls to my great room.The volume button on the Roku remote won't work with my LG sound bar, but will work with the Sharp TV.I have other Roku's I've purchased 5 years ago that still work great. Very reliable products.

  If you wanna be able to control the volume on your TV as well as turn it off and on from the fire stick TV remote, then get the other Fire Stick TV. But if you don’t care and have your TVs remote at hand, save money and get this one. The only difference from the other pricier Fire TV is those two things.

  Streaming is great, however in hindsight I would been better off with the Express. My universal remote doesn't work due to the lack of IR support, and much like my 2017 ROKU 4 the remote control absolutely devours AAA batteries. Sad to see they have made no progress in 3 years.

  Everyone needs to keep up with what Roku does.  It's not the amount of the item;  it's what you're getting for it.  Think about that.  You can do so much with TV as far as watching — no more cable or satellite.  No more hearing the voice prompt through one of those IP carriers.  No more promos.

  So here is the deal. I already have a Roku Streaming Stick 3600R (2016 version) in our family room. We liked it so much that we wanted our kids to have it for their play area TV, which was closer to the router. Since the family room now needed a new streaming device, I decided to go with the next logical step, the Roku Streaming Stick+ 3810.I am not new to the Roku experience and interface. It was still very snappy. The great content apps were still there. It's basically waiting for me to do a TV upgrade to 4K, which I don't know when it's going to happen. :)I also did discover that I can actually turn on/off the power to my Sony sound bar and also control its volume using only the Roku remote. This makes it very convenient.To feel good about this upgrade, I decided to do several tests related to the temperature, Wi-Fi signal (both using Roku secret menus) and then a speed test using Netflix. I know the Netflix test is not a pure speed test because it uses the Netflix servers, but it's an acceptable indicator for me.Please keep in mind that this is not a scientific test. It's more of a test to check for systematic changes between the two Rokus given other fixed factors. I did all testing within the span of 1-2 hours so I hope no major changes were introduced that affected the tests.Test Configuration (things that did not change during testing): - I did *not* change any advanced default settings in the Roku devices (e.g. interference mitigation, power, etc.) - For audio/video, Roku devices were connected via HDMI to a Sony sound bar HT-CT380, *not* directly into the TV. Both the sound bar and TV support only 1080p, not 4K. - For power, Roku devices were connected to Dish Network Hopper 3 receiver's USB port, which is nice because it is on all the time, whether Hopper is powered on or in standby. - For Wi-Fi, Roku devices were connected wirelessly to a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 (with custom Tomato Shibby firmware) which supports both bands: 2.4 and 5.0 GHz.Test Results*** Roku Streaming Stick (3600) ***Temperature: 74 C2.4 GHz Signal strength: 252.4 GHz Antenna 1: 292.4 GHz Antenna 2: 32Glitch/sec: 385.0 GHz Signal strength: 195.0 GHz Antenna 1: 175.0 GHz Antenna 2: 19Glitch/sec: 32.4 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 14.87 Mbps5.0 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 15.63 Mbps*** Roku Streaming Stick+ (3810) ***Temperature: 97 C2.4 GHz Signal strength: 212.4 GHz Antenna 1: 322.4 GHz Antenna 2: 34Glitch/sec: 1775.0 GHz Signal strength: 285.0 GHz Antenna 1: 345.0 GHz Antenna 2: 32Glitch/sec: 02.4 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 35.58 Mbps5.0 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 75.13 MbpsConclusions: - Roku 3810 runs about ~30% hotter than the Roku 3600. I hope it's still within acceptable range. I did not receive any warnings or anything during use. - With Roku 3810, 2.4 GHz overall Signal Strength decreased by ~16% compared to Roku 3600. - With Roku 3810, 5.0 GHz overall Signal Strength improved by ~47% compared to Roku 3600. - With Roku 3810, 2.4 Ghz Netflix connection speed improved by an impressive ~139% compared to Roku 3600. - With Roku 3810, 5.0 Ghz Netflix connection speed improved by an incredible ~380% compared to Roku 3600.Comments: - I noticed in one of the tests that the while the Antennas (1 and 2) signal strengths were higher, the overall Signal Strength was lower. Perhaps the overall Signal Strength takes into account other factors such as  glitch/sec, interference, etc.? I am not really sure. - Even though 2.4 GHz signal was poorer with the new Roku, I still got faster speeds with Netflix. This tells me that not only the antennas are different, but perhaps the Wi-Fi chipset is improved or something. - In general, using 2.4 GHz band produced way more glitches per second compared to 5.0 GHz, so in my situation, I recommend/prefer using the 5.0 GHz band, especially considering the speed test results in Netflix.Overall, I feel happy about the experience.

  Was great while it worked, however, stopped working yesterday which is kind of disappointing. Was watching a movie and all of a sudden the audio cuts off and sounds, for the lack of a better word, laggy? I thought it was the TV because it was pretty old, so I replaced it with my living room TV but the same thing ended up happening. Was flawless before, but the short life quality of the stick has to weigh down the rating.

  The new Fire Stick is a huge improvement, compared to the old version. Fast, with more options, setup takes less than 5 minutes. Alexa recognized my voice commands perfectly (spanish and english) and without any hazzle. The only negative point i can find is that Live Tv options doesn't work outside of the US territory.

  Installed it on the TV in my workshop which is more than 75 feet from our house and from our Wi-Fi router with one extender. It was easy to install and the extra powerful Wi-Fi that’s built into this Roku makes it easy to watch TV in my workshop.

  I had previously purchased the 'table top' version (slightly more expensive) for my daughter, but I decided to try the stick version for myself. Glad I did. It works every bit as good as the more expensive version, yet it is completely unobtrusive.  This baby is completely out of sight: plugs into the USB port on the back of the TV, and the power cord does also. So it's virtually invisible. Works like a charm too!

  Easy to install.  Using it to access Hulu Live.  Occasionally have buffering and sound out of sync.  But typically resolves if powered off and on again.  Takes a little time to set up favorite channels.  More stuff to watch than you could ever find on satellite TV for the price.  Works better than apps on smart TV.

  We like the Roku interface and options, but the remote is AWFUL. Maybe we just received a bum remote, but it constantly hangs up and has trouble connecting to the device. This may be a deal breaker. FireStick remote never had this issue. We switched because Roku has the Spectrum app.

  It was working fairly well, but the remote doesn’t work anymore after 1 year of service. Every time I put new batteries in it, it just drains them in a day. If you go to the Roku site to get a replacement it will cost $25...half the cost of the unit itself! My fire stick works fine after all these years.

  The homepage is way too busy! It's not very intuitive to find what you actually want. And surprisingly, some of the apps don't even work as well as they do on our Gen 1 AppleTV. We ""upgraded"" to this device hoping to love it, and that hasn't been the case.

  I couldnt be more happy. This affordable media player/streamer not only plays every streaming service in the world, it can play media and videos from a NAS with no problems. On the contrary, the user interface could use some improvements by simplifying the set up process or navigation. In conclusion, the apple tv is inferior to ROKU tv!

  Would turn on TV after several hours and lo and behold the screen was black. No HDMI signal detected. Kept having to unplug and plug USB power cable to restart the Roku. Now even that doesn't work. I reset the Roku and still loses signal. What a nightmare that was to sign back into all the apps. Junk. And the remote works poorly as well.

  Beware when you set up the stick. They try to sell you a subscription that you don't need. If you are using the stick for hulu,etc you don't need to purchase a roku subscription. If they tell you that you must have it, hang up and call hulu tech support. They are excellent. They can walk you through it.The stick works good.

  I have a earlier generation Roku and this is makes the experience so much better. The wireless connection is stable, the menus change without hesitation. Your USB port probably won't be able to power the stick, but the included power adapter will take care of that. I don't have a 4K TV, so I can't really comment on that aspect. Looks good on my plasma though.

  This product would have received five stars if it wasn't for the sound issue. When I turn it on there's no sound. According to my research this issue has been going on for a while and there are tons of ""fixes"" but the only thing that seems to work for me is unplugging it from the wall and plugging it back in. This as you can imagine is very annoying.

  This was very easy to install.  It provided access to Disney +  which was my reason for buying it.  Of course, it also has Netflix and a range of other apps, such as Amazon Prime that I also now access via ROKU.I have a HD Samsung TV that is WIFI enabled but my Samsung TV does not support Disney plus.  That was my reason for this purchase.

  Product was good.  Almost to the day (shipped Dec 4, 2017) (failed Dec 5, 2018), the unit failed.Thought it was the remote, but the volume still worked for the TV.  Did the complete reboot/reset of the main unit, couldn’t get any farther than the remote reset button.This is the same problem I had with a 3600 version.  I am now convinced this is not an isolated case but more common than “we” are aware.When spending $40+ or $50+, I frankly expect it to last for years, not months.

  Barely had it a week & today it warned of overheating. Trying to stream the Super Bowl caused frequent “loading” windows. Had to go get a Roku out of the kid’s room to watch the show. They’re sending me an extender for it, if that fixes it I’ll update. Otherwise I’ll be sending this back.

  Finally upgraded to Roku Streaming Stick+ after years of using the Roku Stick.  The buying point for me is the stronger WiFi connectivity and the voice command.  Not happy though that it is still laggy similar to my old Roku stick.  I still have to figure out how to use the voice command from the remote control.Still giving a 4 out of 5 as I'm not sure if it is my WiFi issue,

  We used this as a replacement to an older Roku. This version works with our TV and cable system better because it will turn on the TV and go to an available source automatically when you activate it. It also does not require the small box that the prior model from a few years ago needed. Instead the stick just plugs into a USB port on the back of the TV.

  I regret having bought this item. Partly my fault tho' because I did not do my research well before buying. Roku is just way behind in features with other android tv boxes. Had I known that this does not support VPN apps and is not capable of doing Bluetooth transmission, I should just bought instead an Amazon stick or any other android tv box.

  I’ve had this thing in operation about a year and I over the last two weeks I’ve had to pair the remote multiple times every single time I go to use it.  Waste of money if forced obsolescence is one year after activation.  I have a ten year old wireless blu ray player that is more reliable than this stick.

  Excellent device for cord cutters.  Only thing I would change would be the look of the home screen.  Feels a bit cluttered, but is easy to navigate and find what you want.  Also, wish they would add a feature to shut off a tv show or live tv when the tv is shut off, if the device is plugged into the wall for power.  If it is plugged into the tv for power it will shut off.  Some small updates would be great to improve this but overall very satisfied.  Got out of direct tv and went to hulu live tv and use this device regularly.

  Freezes constantly. Have to unplug and replug it in at least once a week. For PlayStation Vue, occasionally the info banner would never go away. No matter what I did unless I unplugged it, would make it go away.  Finally the remote would cease to work at times. Again, would have to reboot the stick to get everything to work again.

  At first it seemed to work ok but the longer we used it the worse it got. Whenever it would go into sleep mode I would push every button on the remote to try to wake it up and nothing would work, I would have to go directly to the roku stick and push the home button for it to finally come out of sleep mode. Also after time the audio would get behind the video and I would have to pause the show every 10 minutes for it to catch up. This stick would be good for a guest bedroom that doesn't get used daily. We have used a roku for years so I'm not dissing their company as a whole just the stick. I will be going back to the roku box.

  Great product, only issue I’ve had is that sometimes the remote becomes unpaired with the roku so I have to use the app on my phone instead to control it. The issue usually resolved after the roku is restarted. It has a way better interface than the main competitor and isn’t trying to push products to do.

  The Amazon stick is good but this roku stick is so much better. It has a Netflix, hulu, sling, and Directvnow button. Not only that the buttons are soft and dont hurt your fingers.

  I bought two at the same time about one year ago. The Roku itself works fine, but the remotes are infuriating. They stop working constantly. Sometimes reprogramming them works, but usually it seems like there isn't any rhyme or reason to it. The Roku can't be used without it, so the remote kind of ruins the whole product.

  The product is very good and I do like it but I am very upset because I bought it for $50 two weeks before it sold for $30. I am a very good Amazon prime purchaser and I think that maybe I should have been warned to wait another two weeks. Because I had no idea, I spent an extra $20.

  Streaming is great with this Firestick Lite. The only thing I notice is that I doesn't have the volume buttons or voice on the remote, but we have a Smart TV remote for that and can just tell Alexa to turn it up or down. It's well worth getting the Lite over the regular Firestick and easy to use.

  This product,the Fire Tv Stick Lite, does its job but I have to rate it a one for not having a Volume & On/Off button/Feature- which make this remote worthless because u have to get up and turn on/off the Tv and if ur tv has no volume button then this lite remote is Useless.But my other Fire Tv Stick with the Volume & Off/On Feature is 5 Stars❣️

  Overall its ok, its very basic and you can download plenty of apps which facilitates the experience.As a linguist who works with A.I I think the voice feature is good. I am giving it a 3 for the long wires. it is not aesthetically cute to have them plugged to a tiny drive.But get it if you just just want to watch your basic channels!

  You will need power for the stick. I though a HDMI was all it required, but you will need a USB port for an additional plug or plug it into a wall socket. I also had to order the free HDMI adapter as the design of the TV back was blocking the large stick from going in by itself.

  Roku is amazing. It just works! Very easy to navigate even my 75 year old father knows how to work it. I love the extra strong Wifi antenna included in this plus model. You also get the 4K support at a very reasonable price. This is the most value packed Roku model! Get it you won’t be disappointed!

  I have 3 other Rokus; 2,2's and 1,3. I needed an updated one for a TV. It's super fast in connection and surfing! I highly recommend this stick. No need to aim the remote at anything.

  Control feels cheap and it is not very responsive.  On top of that most of the options need to be paid by separate.  Once you subscribe, you have to pay for the movies on top of that and/or Premium subscriptions.  Trials are no longer for a month.  They’re giving you just 7 days.  They ask for too much information for what you are getting back.

  Upgrade from an old 2XS model. We LOVE the Roku family of products that work so well.Don't buy the extra USB cable that Amazon suggests. It's not necessary and all needed comes in the box.I've seen some reviews that the startup time for the Roku when using the TV's USB is a problem. I disagree. The startup time of this Roku stick is quite quick and I've never found myself waiting for it.

  Works well. This one is located upstairs, so it takes a short time to connect with the wifi.

  Faulty power cable!  Kept getting an “Insufficient Power” error.  Moved the stick to every HDMI port on the TV and plugged it directly into the wall, but kept happening.  I dig through an old stash of cables I keep and found a male to female USB cable (not common) and replaces the cable and VOILA!  Problem solved.  Wish they’d refund about 1/2 the purchase price for pain and suffering while I worked through the issue.

  I recently purchased 3 Roku streaming sticks.  I had to replace the original batteries in all 3 but 2 of the 3 remotes drain batteries within a few days.  There is no obvious reason for what causes the power drain which leads me to assume it's poor internal design or production quality.  The Roko support page has no solution other then send it back and we'll send you a replacement.

  Roku has changed my way to watch TV. User interface is awesome, easy to navigate, fast response. 4K clarity is very good. This has much more value than Chromecast while you pay less money for it.

  Got tired of cable prices going up so dropped it completely and got the roku stick with voice remote. Paired it with sling and get all the channels I had before, and a few I didn't. (not including the initial price of the roku stick my cost is less than 50 bucks, including cost of internet) picture, sound, ease of use, movies and tv, pause, record.  Should have done this switch long ago.  I would highly recommend going to roku.

  We finally cut the cord. So I purchased the Streaming Stick + to attach to my semi-smart Vizio 60"" TV. Even though it's not a 4K TV the picture looks good at 1080p. This is our 5th Roku in the house, so setup was easy even setting up to power on and off the TV and volume control.The reason for the 3 stars are for the following reasons:1. Voice control is a bust. All of us tried to use the voice control we all received different results. Not sure if it's a learning curve thing or it still needs to grow.2. Remote not responding after a cold startup. It can take anywhere from 15 seconds to a minute for the Remote Status prompt to pop up and then the remote will respond to commands. Now this could also be a side effect of powering up the Roku when the TV starts, as I use the USB port on the TV to power the Roku, because I know my family will not put the Roku in standby when they power the TV off, so the Roku will continue to stream.4/15/18. Update. After reading the Roku stick troubleshooting FAQ, I discovered that some TV's HDMI ports don't play well with the Roku sticks or cause inference. Roku recommends installing the HDMI extender cable. (you can order one from Roku for free) I bought a 3 and 1 HDMI spilter and set the Roku stick in plain view of the remote and no more remote issues.

  Here’s my suggestion: don’t go with roku. They hid a subscription from me and charged my account for it. I couldn’t even find the subscription on my account to cancel it.

  Honestly, we love our roku sticks in the beginning and then they just stop working.  We will NEVER buy another one again.  We also bought a roku tv and the roku doesn’t even work.  Disappointed.

  This is a great invention. I keep buying it over and over for every television at the office, at the house, at every room. Fire your cable company and watch almost anything and everything here on Roku. Now you can even talk to it and control the volume on the remote. I bought the first one ages ago and have continued to upgrade and you will too.

  We cut our cable and this is perfect. We have YoutubeTV so we can still watch love sports and this is one of the few devices that you can download the YoutibeTV app. My original Roku stick has a bad adapter cord and kept having to be restarted, but Amazon replaced it with no problem and it's worked great since. Very happy with this product.

  These new sticks are great.  The new remote is much more compatible with the TVs, so you don’t need 2 remotes, just this one.  Has all the features as the more expensive models but you can only use wifi (no LAN port) which works for me.

  Roku is far superior than AppleTV which has a “closed” ecosystem. Roku is agnostic and plays nice with all streaming services. Plus, Roku is not only better hardware, but a better value than Apple’s insultingly over priced products. Only complaint about Roku is the interface. It’s clear and easy, but is long overdue for a design upgrade. Looks “low rent” and cheap.

  Zero problems installing and using - and my TVs are relatively old. I rotate one Roku device between the living room TV and bedroom TV using Century Link DSL (recommended.) I share Showtime and Netflix subscriptions with a friend across town who also uses Roku with Cox Cable - no problems. I have to change batteries about every 4 months. I will never go back to old-fashioned cable TV watching. #CordCutter #LoveRoku

  The stick itself I haven't had any problems with but the remote lasted about a month when it suddenly stopped working. I thought it was the batteries so they were replaced but I had to keep slapping the remote in the palm of my hand to get it to work. I'd give it 4 stars if the remote wasn't so cheap and ill conceived!!

  Bought this specifically for the ability to use the Spectrum TV app in areas of my house (patio & garage) that do not have coax cable outlets.  It works perfectly, super easy setup!  I have found this little stick is capable of so much more, if I didn't work for the cable company and get free service, I would absolutely cut the cord and go 100% Roku.  Must have solid wifi signal, otherwise poor quality.

  I ordered the Roku Streaming Stick because I just had Spectrum TV put in my home. The agent I talked with when ordering Spectrum suggested that I might want to consider the Roku for TVs that don't have a box or TVs that I don't want the box showing. The Spectrum app on the Roku is actually easer to use than the remotes on TVs with the box and I get the benefit of all the other TV available on Roku. I love it!

  We now own 3 Roku and love the ease of it. Roku works great! Easy to install and set up. I am using it with an old tv.  I had to plug it into the wall instead of the tv for a better connection. I only wish the remote was backlit. I added the Roku app to my phone and I am able to use my phone as a remote. I tried the voice recognition. It was easy to use. Streaming quality is good. I don’t use Alexa.

  Purchased this item in May 2019. The Roku streaming stick is working as expected. However, the remote is having issues. It freezes up and none of the buttons on the face of the remote work (power button, OK button, Home, Back, nothing works). The volume buttons on the side are the only things that will work. I have reset the remote several times and the issue reoccurs on a daily bases.

  Ditch your extra Charter boxes and get this instead. Not only will it save you money (will only have to pay for one box), but you also get the benefit of additional apps. All you need is one Charter box in order to use the Spectrum app to watch the cable you already pay for.

  Nice that it integrates the tv power and volume into one remote.  This is a really nice bonus.  I did not find the wireless to be long range at all.  A fire stick has much better range than this.

  This is soooooo much better than an Amazon Fire Stick.  I had a Fire Stick for a few years.  It got to the point of being a very frustrating experience.  I really wanted to throw it out the window.  Oh wait, I did!  But before I did that, I got a Roku.  This is such an easy device to use.  Plus there are many stations you can load onto this, not to mention the paid content (Netflix, Hulu, etc.).  My TV experience is much more enjoyable now.

  The only way I can use this is if I re-pair the remote every single time! Completely pointless! I have changed batteries, increased my wifi strength, and tried all the advice online. Nothing will keep this remote paired and now it is too late to return. I am very disappointed!

  After 7 months of use, it is keep disconnecting from the network. It is so frustrating to buy 60$ worth of device and this experience. My TV is 7 years old (smart TV) and runs amazing but this small stick gives me lot of hard time. On Roku technical support makes me wait for 20 mins. I wish there was simple return process.It has good functionality and support Xfinity app, Netflix, Prime etc but all this functionality becomes no use if it if keeps disconnecting from network. I have changed battery 4-5 times in 7 months. Reason I didnt buy Chromecast as it does not have remote and your remote keeps acting up.

  Before buying this device we had a computer connected to the TV. The remote makes it easier than a computer to control what you are viewing but then without a keyboard YouTube is sort of limited. I haven't tried the voice function, will update when I do. Also I have a slow connection and because of that, I think, most of the channels don't work. Though two of our favorite channels, YouTube and Netflix works nicely. Another pro is the small size and easy setup.

  Been troubleshooting with Roku ""support"" for months now. Basically they just don't answer me and tell me they'll check back in soon and don't. Run a quick google on ""roku sound issues"" and you'll see that it's a rampant problem across the platform that they've done nothing to address for months now. Wish I could return but too late.

  I like that this mode allows for no hanging wires. What I don’t like is how quickly the remote burns through batteries. I have two rooms with the same Roku and they both have the same problem. I’ve even tried buying extra pricey batteries and it doesn’t make much difference.

  This is my third and favorite Roku. The device itself is small and easy to set up. It is very responsive. The ability to control TV power and volume is a game changer. The voice search is accurate, fast, and so convenient it is fun. My only suggestion for improvement is to get rid of the dedicated channel buttons on the bottom or make them programmable.

  Got this specifically for the extended WiFi range feature. My router is in 2nd floor of my home, and the streaming devices I've had downstairs have always had difficulty streaming due to a weaker signal. The most problematic has been Amazon Video, but that's another story. With this Roku I've had 0 issues. Everything streams perfectly in HD.

  Roku is the best streaming solution on the market with many apps available.  We own 9 Roku units in 2 homes and bought our first one over 4 years ago to handle Netflix. Since then we have expanded to several other apps with Plex our choice to handle DVR recording and manage our video, photos and movies...  Definitely worth the expense!

  I like the product that you could just hit a tv channel button and it bring up a tv guide but I didn't like it that it has no tv controls to turn on or off or turn the volume up or down on the tv making you have to use 2 remotes.

  Me and my daughter love our fire stick. Don't know how we ever lived without it! Its better than my old Cox Contour has more variety! Old or new, you'll never tell the difference. Volume control, no volume control you'll still use two remotes at some point.

  DiSLiKe.. I would rather pay a little extra $$ for the upgraded version. You don't realize how convenient it is to have the power & volume on the same/one remote.The menu is also different from the regular fire stick. But no hard to get used to.

  This is much slower than the Roku box it replaced. The stick is constantly hot (not warm) too the touch. I think the hardware just overheats and they didn't think of heat dissipation when designing this product.

  I am not sure as I did not get any information when I received the control. I do not use it often at all. Have been having trouble with the fire stick as it seems I have to reset it each time I want to use it, then several times Netflix picture has frozen and the volume is ok???? Weird.

  Not a fan of this at all. It has its “eco” mode but you can never tell if the tv is on or off. If left on for too long, the audio doesn’t work. You have to unplug it from the TV and then back in and play around with it for the audio to come back. I switched back to my 6 year old roku stick. Works much better than this!

  Works great! Easy to plug into our vizio and with a quick hit of the input key we can get over to the Roku feature. There’s not a mute key on the remote and we have to go to input scroll to the hdmi input and change over to use. Not a huge hassle but a design flaw to fix.

  The Roku Streaming Stick is easy to use, controls TV on/off and volume, and offers the best streaming experience we've had, even better than our smart Samsung and smart Vizio TVs.

  I might as well have just flushed $50 in the toilet.  The whole point of getting this was to have use of VPN while I used it.  Doesn't have built in VPN or DNS functionality.

  After spending over an hour trying to activate an account online and contacting them twice in the process for help, the Roku is still not activated. I already have an Apple TV for another television in our home, so I will gladly purchase another one for the ease of setup.

  The Roku turned my dumb TV into a Smart one. I switched from cable to a streaming service after my bill became astronomical. I can get all the channels I had before, local channels, sports, on demand, and DVR from a couple of subscriptions all with the Roku. And I can take it with me to other locations.

  The best streaming device out there right now.  The wifi is great, I've had no problems with signal.  It's much faster than the previous generation Rokus.  I don't even have a 4K TV, but the improved wifi made it worth it to upgrade to the + version.

  Best thing ever created... until it stopped working and apparently it is a regular thing for these devices. It'll attempt to download an update and as a result it turns the device into a ""brick"", as its commonly called online, rendering it and the money you spent on it useless.

  
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This product is okay but I think the flow and the look of the Firestick is better. The one thing I do like about Roku is the Roku channel. What I don’t like about the Roku is the remote is cheaply made or at least sounds like it when I’m pressing the buttons.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Scammers DO interfere with the activation process. To prevent this, you need to set up an account with Roku before trying to activate your device, AND read the directions which state there is no activation fee and BEWARE of Scammers.

  I won't bother to review the streaming stick itself, as other reviewers have already done a great job; I just want to point out two huge issues with the Roku remote: you can power your tv on/off and control volume, but there is no Mute button! Seriously?! I also wish that the shortcut buttons for Netflix, Sling, Hulu, and Vudu could be reprogrammed with your own favorite apps. I don't use a single one of those services. I have a workaround for the Mute button: use the Roku app on your smartphone. Turn your Media volume to ""off"", then press the Headphones icon (private listening) to mute. A bit of a pain, but at least it keeps me from having to use the TV remote for the sole purpose of muting.

  I was looking for a way to ""cut the cord"" and save money on my satellite bill. The Roku Stick was the perfect way to do just that. Set up was easy. Once I plugged it in, there were only a few easy steps to follow and the remote even automatically synced with my television, making the Roku remote the only one I need to use. Once it is connected, you have access to Hulu, Netfix and YouTubeTV to name a few. The voice remote works great if you want to navigate the Roku menu that way.

  It was pretty good comparing it to the 4K version I have I liked it and just wasn't a big fan of the small menu set up special since this was more built for the kids room they're not too familiar with the tiny print so if there's a way to fix that I'd appreciate it.

  The firestick gives you access to the same apps as that of the regular firestick. However, you might miss the convenience of using the ""fire"" remote to operate the volume and on/off features of your TV. But, if you have not had a firestick before, you won't miss it.

  I have a 4K Roku streaming box that works great. I was hesitant about buying this one because of my wifi signal not being strong in the part of the house I wanted to use it in. It works great! No signal drop at all. It was simple to install and updates rather quickly. I am super happy with this purchase and may buy another one in the future.

  I got this on Amazon Day for $17.99 and it was well worth it. I ""cut the cord"" 10 years ago. Being stuck in due to COVID-19 in a NE winter is hard enough, this winter will go much faster. The picture quality is great and buffering is minimal. I say give it a try, your winter will go much faster!

  As I have not owned a fire stick before I assume that it's working properly. I never realized it would cost almost as much as cable to view programs using a fire stick. I am not returning it.  So much of what I am viewing are old programs. Maybe as I learn to use it better I will change my mind.

  The product is really cool. I have it n my bedroom and it's really easy to setup and use. The only issue that I had was it didn't have the USB power cord in the box so I chatted with Amazon online and was told that since it wasn't n box I needed 2 purchase one seperately even though it clearly showed on box that it was included.

  I have a Samsung Smart TV, but this is even smarter. The Samsung is frequently slow and stops to reload the buffer. It no longer supports Youtube and has limited channels. The Roku is much faster using the same wifi connection. I'm very impressed with all the channels available. I'll have to spend some time researching which are the most interesting. The streaming stick plugs into the back of my tv and the remote works fine.

  I really like the product and highly recommend it.

  This product gave us problems from the beginning. Whern I contacted Amazon, they said we would have to get in touch with a Roku. After a long wait,i finally got a Roku rep on the phone. He said they would send a HDMI extender to fix the problem. It did not fix the problem. We have emailed as directed to and have received NO response. I will try once again to call them which is no easy feat, but I’m not expecting any help. This product is still under warranty. I would never recommend this streaming device to anyone.

  This is my second Roku for our house... I prefer Roku over other similar devices. Easy to use and to navigate through the menus, etc.My only improvement is to have a central area that keeps track of what you watched and your show's progress no matter what channel it was on. I don't always remember what I was watching or which channel it was on.

  Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Often I will turn on my TV just for the product not to work. I will have to continually restart my tv just for the remote to do anything. Also, when I am on YouTube, the device will change videos randomly for no apparent reason. I recommend buying a chromecast over this product.

  The only hard thing about setting up the Roku and using it was that it was so easy.  I kept thinking there had to be more to it.  Nope, just point and click.  If I can get this this plugged in and running than anybody can do it.  It looks just like the app menu on my phone too so really easy to use for all of us.

  i like roku .  but our remote works inconsistently.  sometimes it won't control volume, sometimes it won't control anything.  we have to reset it through the unit multiple times and it works for a while.  we have changed the batteries, etc.  this is so disappointing for something we have only owned for a couple months.

  Amazon should be ashamed for selling this product without putting in bold headlines that it won't work with Spectrum TV.  No app exists in their app list, but you are led to believe you can install it from the internet.  You can, but the version requires an upgrade to work, which is NOT available.

  We upgraded from an older Roku that didn’t like being powered via USB. THIS ONE WORKS GREAT THROUGH USB! “Open Pluto TV” and it opens the app (what? I like 70’s and 80’s game shows!). OMG, I’m so spoiled now I don’t even have to scroll! Picture is amazing. Very happy.

  I have two problems with this product. One is that I have to hit the power button a couple of times before the tv turns on. It may work better if I put the device on the hdmi port on the side of the tv but I haven't tried that yet (don't really want to). The other issue is there in no mute button on the remote. Not happy about that. Other than those issues it works ok

  I needed a streaming device for the camper and went with Roku this time. I have amazon fire tv at home and am pleased but I think the picture quality with roku is better and it resonates a bit faster than the fire.Set up took all of five minutes and I’m not having any trouble navigating through it.

  We have both a fire stick and a roku and we definitely love the roku more. Easy to use, everything is accessible on one screen, the only one minor hiccup we’ve had is sometimes the voice and video is a little off... then we have to completely disconnect from the tv and reboot it. I’m not sure what causes that but other than that, we love it!

  Had issues with the first gen FireStick no longer functioning well. This includes apps crashing, running slow, and needing constant reboots and resets just to keep it working. So I went ahead and bought this device and I have to say for using it on a 15 year old tv and it runs amazingly fast.

  This product works even better than I expected. Easy, easy install. Remote is very intuitive and the voice operation works perfectly, even when I speak softly. We bought it to use with YouTube TV - we finally cut the cable! Roku is perfect to manage our YouTube TV, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video, as well as all the other apps available. After this experience, we are never going back to cable TV or Direct TV.

  I used an Apple TV for years but randomly bought a TV with the Roku system built in. That pretty much sold me on Roku going forward. Way less expensive and far easier to conceal than ATV.We’ve also had a Fire TV stick and this Roku is superior to that as well.If Roku ever managed to get iTunes (probably never )it would be basically perfect.

  This didn't work with my 4k Vizio TV initially. It only detected 1080p during setup, and It gave me the purple HDCP error when trying to stream anything and everything. I bought a cheap 3ft HDMI extender that supports HDCP 2.2 for $5.95; plugged it into my HDMI 1/ ARC port; did the video auto-detectand on the roku setup again, where it detected 4k and HDCP successfully; and now it streams video just fine....

  Works great, lots of stuff to surf the tv now that I have it.  Added Youtubetv for the local channels and a couple extras Roku and the free channels like Pluto don't have.  Makes a nice assortment.  Lacks a search engine, hopefully they'll add one.

  Great selection of ‘channels’ to watch.  Sound quality is awe full though. The picture and the sound are constantly out of sync and it’s not just one or two ‘channels’ it all of them.  Our DVD player and TV do not have this issue.

  I bought this for my 74 year old mother to give her more options for watching shows while she is homebound due to the pandemic.  I was worried she would have trouble using it, but it turns out it was simple and easy to use.  It gives her tons of options to find programming that fits her interests..  She loves it.

  Had this Roku for just over a year, and 1 year after purchasing it, it died.  Keep getting an ""overheating"" message on it now. Roku says return to place of purchase (Amazon) and Amazon says warranty expired.

  This replaced a Roku we already had. We were experiencing lags and weird picture issues, likely because it was on the opposite side of the house  and down a floor than the router. The Roku Streaming Stick+ cleared up all those issues. All the issues from the first Roku (which was several years old) disappeared.

  Didn't come in the original packaging like amazon said it would.Was not the streaming stick plus. It was ""streaming stick"" (last gen)Didn't come with the remote, although description said nothing about missing remote.First time that I tried Amazon warehouse. I guess they can't be trusted.

  We have a flat screen in a bedroom up On the next level about as far away from the router as the TV could be. We tried the basic Roku receiver and we could not get a connection from WiFi. We tried the Roku streaming stick and no problem getting a signal to watch Netflix, Disney +

  I bought this in March 2020 for Disney Plus and we could not get this to work.  We decided to get You Tube TV in October 2020 and the power cord with the long-range wireless adapter would not maintain a connection with the streaming stick.  It is a piece of junk and I would give it less than one star if I could.

  After 34 days, the unit just quit.  Hit the re-set button on the unit, and the Roku emblem comes up on the screen for about 20 seconds, then it just shuts down.  Can't get into the menus or anything.  Just a paperweight.  Tried on 3 different TV's.....no signal.

  Didn't realize I had to plug a.c. into the stick. However works great. Have an old smart tv which was extremely slow in streaming netflix and amazon prime. The roku stick however is very fast like it is plugged right into the internet. Quite pleased.

  I’ve had nothing but problems with Roku and terrible support from their customer service. My enhanced remote rarely pairs with the streaming stick and it completely died last week.

  Much easier menu system than my older fire stick.  Like the voice control and the buttons for Netflix and Hulu on the remote. Speeds time to actually streaming.  It even is able to turn on my TV, so no separate remote.

  I upgraded my old roku into this one and have made one of the best decisions yet! My tv is a secondhand and doesn’t have a controller, so the roku streaming stick+ is able to prove the power, volume control, voice recognition, etc. Which is absolutely perfect. It streams really well, and I’m just so happy with the upgrade I made!

  This runs faster then the Roku TVs we own.  Integrates and operates a not-smart TV better than a smart TV.

  This is as good as other, more expensive, streaming devices.  The only downside is that you cannot stream music.  I have iTV for that.  Intuitive remote, all the parts integrate seamlessly.  Highly recommend this as you get such quality at a fair price.

  The Roku streaming stick arrived on time as pictured.  it was simple to set up.  Insert stick in HDMI input of your television, attach power cable to power source then follow the on screen prompts.  Plenty of content, free and pay to view, to be found through the Roku service.

  I have several Roku Ultras and I was looking for something less expensive to put in my daughter's room.  The Roku Streaming Stick was so easy to set up and works just as well as the more expensive Ultra.  I liked it so much I may buy another one for my other daughter's room.

  Previously we used our ""smart"" TV, which is, quite frankly, pretty dumb.  The Roku is easy to set up, easy to use, easy to control with the remote or with your smart phone, fast, responsive, intuitive... Can I say any more?  We waited until it was on sale (Black Friday), so the mega-discount didn't hurt either.

  We have only used it for a week, but so far, great.  Prior to this we used a fire TV stick.  This is twice as fast, has better picture quality, is easier to use.  The best is reception of our wi-fi signal due to the antennae in the cord.

  Fantastic product. Works great for 4K streaming. Easy setup. Unlike a lot of folks, I like the interface. I've seen reviews elsewhere suggest other products instead that have better voice control. I can say from using those products that the voice control is mostly awful. Just stick with what works in the Roku here.

  
"

  If you do not put this on a 4K TV, it will refresh about every 5-10 min for an hour. No matter the settings. Tried putting it on my Samsung 3D 1080 TV and it does it every time. It’s ok on my 4K TV!!

  
"

  Works great....when it works which is 10% of the time. The other 90% the app for Spectrum is unavailable. What's the point if I only get to use it 10% of the time. I think this was a waste of money unless someone can help me with my issues....Spectrum doesn't seem to want to help! They want you to rent their cable box for a price.

  Incredible device in every way. It does all it claims, including 4k, hdr, vastly superior connectivity and speed to an already superior wifi, vast speed increases everywhere. The 1080p is even an extreme improvement. Don't go home without one!

  This works great when it works. Often it will not respond to the remote. to get it to work I remove the batteries and put them back and all is well. I was changing the batteries then I realized they were not dead it needed to reset. so I have two of these one is prefect the other is an issue,

  The Fire TV Stick Lite does the job of streaming your favorites.  I found setting it up to be fairly simple.  My only issue is inconsistency with connecting to my Wifi.

  After 5 months of use, internet gets disconnected all the time and I have to reboot the system for it to start working.  When I contact the customer service, they blame my internet service provider which is bogus because i check connectivity and strength of connectivity with a wireless tablet and it works fine.The remote control is another issue which freezes all the time and have to wait few minutes for it to start working and if waiting doesn't solve the issue then I have to reboot the whole device again.

  Worked beautifully for four months and then developed a horrible buzzing sound and lag in video which made it unusable.

  I bought this thing 3 months ago and rarely use it because it's in a spare bedroom and the remote already stopped working. I switched the batteries, and tried pairing it, and nothing. There is literally no light on the top of the remote nor in the reset area. This is highly disappointing when you have maybe used something 10 times and it's already broken.

  I purchased the Roku Streaming Stick + a few months back but have been having persistent HDCP Errors.  The Error would happen every few minutes and was extremely annoying.  I really wanted this $56 device to work so I researched several solutions and found this one on some geek page.  I don’t know what that says about me but, long story short here’s what you can do if returning your Roku Streaming Stick +  is no longer an option and you have an extra $40 to spend.In able to use a HDMI cable that is HDCP 2.2 compliant as the Error page indicates, you must first plug your ROKU SS+ into the input of a HDCP 2.2 compliant HDMI splitter, then connect your 2.2 compliant cable to one of the outputs on the splitter to a HDMI input on your TV.  Since the Roku SS+ derives it’s power through a very short usb cable, I simply kept the splitter/Stick union close to the USB port on the back of the TV to allow use of the provided cable front the Roku SS+ to the usb port.  I happened to already have a 3D brand splitter that worked just fine but I suspect others will work as well as long as they are HDCP 2.2 compliant.I’ve included some pics.  Note you can see both ends of my new, black colored HDMI cable running from the splitter output to the HDMI input on the TV (the HDMI input on my tv is sort of hidden behind the Roku in the picture) and the short usb cable running from the Roku SS+ to the USB port on my LG tv for power.  The splitter has a stand alone power source but when I plugged the USB powered Roku into the splitter it provided power to both the splitter and the Roku and I did not need to use it.  Hope this helps!Two days since I added the splitter to my cable arrangement and so far no more HDCP Errors!  The picture and sound is fantastic.  Finally working like it should have on its own.  Would have gotten 5 stars if it had!

  The remote control is not compatible with my 2-year old Samsung Smart TV. I bought the stick to be able to view YouTubeTV since old Samsung TVs dont support. I called the tech support. After waiting for 15 min, an oversease agent told me that it is only compatible with Android TV. This is a very important feature and is not included in product description. Will be returing the device shortly.

  I’m on a fence with Roku products. This one works well with my Sonicview tv but fails to work with my Sony Bravia KDL 19M4000 tv.  It makes no sense that it can’t control the volume and power on the Sony TV.  It seems like Sony has been making TVs forever.

  I have two of these stick Rokus and a Roku Ultra.  The Ultra is more reliable and the remote works better.  The stick Rokus need to be rebooted at least once a week. I wish they were as reliable as the Apple TV box in my Home Theater room, but that sucker is 5 times the cost of the Roku sticks, so the bedrooms get Rokus.

  When it works properly, it's great. The remote will randomly only partially work (volume keys work, nothing else), even after different batteries the problem will randomly reappear.

  I bought a Fire TV stick a year and half ago but the two 2020 Fire TV stick I bought a month ago with the voice recognition is everything. Instead of typing in what I want to watch, all I have to do is say what I want and the remote will do the work for me 😀. I’m glad that they added this feature 👍🏽

  After purchasing 4 of these, sadly disappointed. I rather use my old Fire stick. Apps are weirdly put on Lite Fire Stick. Cost was low where I purchased, so okay for $10 each. Just NOT what I expected. Good thing I got a Old Fire Stick. Added the Lite to an Extra room.

  This the third fire stick to get for my TV’s location in my house. Regardless how far from the router network, all Fire sticks receive strong signal. Very smooth streaming with crystal clear streaming. It is easy to set up and download  app from different sources. I highly recommend it over any other streaming device

  This product worked well up until about a week ago. It loads slow or not at all. Has issues connecting to wireless network for some reason. I have done all of the trouble shooting through roku manual and wireless provider. Ive had it for a year so perhaps this device is a short term product. Wishing it had a warranty. Very disappointed.😔

  There’s nothing to dislike about this product. Roku is such a better option than cable, satellite or anything. The apps are endless, you have every TV show you can ask for with Hulu and Netflix which makes binge watching a piece of cake. You can go with sling for live tv. It’s all a flat rate and won’t go up by $120 after the first year. Roku and it’s apps make cable and satellite look like Cinderella’s step sisters. Thank you roku!

  This really worked well for me for a secondary TV that was at a little farther distance from my WiFi modem. No complaints, works great and love that the sound and power are all on the roku controller, so you don’t need to use two controllers.

  Have owned older model Rokus and a Fire TV, but none of these delivered  a picture on large screens that was comparable to Dish. This Roku stick produces an outstanding picture to my television, great audio, and is very easy to install. Just a matter of time before the dish comes down now.

  This thing is great for making older TVs smart. The voice recognition is decent but if I’m looking for something particular it fumbles my words up which can be frustrating, but overall this device is a great value for anyone who doesn’t want or need to invest in a brand new smart TV.

  Misleading advertising. When you try to activate the device, you get an activation error asking you to call Roku Customer Service. Then Customer Service (from the Phillipines) tells you to ignore the on-screen message about free activation. Their new policy requires a payment of $99.00. Disgusting business practice...

  We are so pleased with this Roku Streaming Stick.

  I researched CNET to see which product would suit me best: Roku or Amazon Fire Stick. Seeing as our TV in the living room is the furthest point away from the WIFI, there was a very weak signal. CNET stated this product was very good at pulling in the signal and of course the built in features were good as well. As soon as I plugged it in, the WIFI had no problem at all and streaming content didn't have to buffer, along with the quicker downloading. So I ordered a second one for another TV and plan on ordering two more for the rest of the house. Soon....no more Directv and their high pricing!

  It’s easy to setup and very nice to use...when it works. I say 50% of the time I get no audio and have to completely restart the device. Searching the internet shows it’s a very common issue.

  The attach point on the stick for the power cord was faulty with loose connection.  It worked OK for a couple months, but  gravity finally won as the power cord would start falling out of the socket and connection was lost.  It gradually got worse and finally failed completely.

  I'm a longtime Roku owner. This is a disaster. It won't deliver anything higher than 720. My high end wireless D-Link router is 20' away. Roku wanted me to work too hard diagnosing what was clearly their problem & I had no time or desire to investigate. Every previous Roku working perfectly instantly. Disaster.

  I love these Roku devices so much. We've had Roku devices for years on every TV in the house. I bought this one to replace an old one that worked just fine, but I wanted to new NETFLIX app, which only comes with the newer Roku's. (""Skip Intro"" was a feature worth paying for.)

  What more do I need to say.  It plugs directly into the TV, using the power directly from the TV. It does come with a power cord for external plug in. I chose to not use external plug in. This way I don't have to turn on individual devices.

  Was forced to upgrade when switching from Sling to DirectTV Now (my old Roku sticks weren't compatible) and was a little bitter, but oh my, the quality of stream is soooo much better with the new sticks.  Worth the cost of the upgrade!  I've been using the Roku for 2 years now and I love it!

  I have yet to try the voice recognition feature. I had to order a free ""jump cable""  for this item to work on my smart tv, which must be a common issue. Not sure why they don't include this item with the kit. Waited an additional 5 days after ordering to receive part so I could set up tv.

  Works great now that I bought a 6ft usb extension so that I can power it.  Was a little frustrated to learn that neither my TV or Verizon Cable Box produce enough power thru the USB ports to run the Roku stick.  Great picture and fast menu.  Also appreciate that it works well without a super strong WiFi signal.

  Extremely compact and easy to set up, if you are adding or replacing this with a older Roku it will even install your old channels on the new device.  Remote is comfortable and easy to use, Interface is straight forward and intuitive, and extremely responsive, no or low wait items for apps to start. I have tested out around 90% of all streaming devices out there from apple tv. to gaming devices and always go back to Roku because of the price and performance.

  Roku is the easiest in terms of set up and features. I like how this streaming stick can control the power and volume on the TV, literally the only remote I need. The Roku in my opinion is the best since it’s platform agnostic and you don’t have to choose Apple, Google or Amazon!

Finally bought the Roku stick and it has simplified/streamlined my whole streaming experience. And setting up the stick was so easy I couldn't believe it. I was streaming on my TV in about 10 mins. Can't recommend this product highly enough.

  First off I love Roku but and this thing is a good product but with 600+ channels and no way to enter a channel number or store favorites -sucks. Voice feature to go to a channel does not work that way.

  Is it possible to give this a lower score than 1 star?  In less than a week I have had to unplug the fire stick four times due to no sound.  This is beyond ridiculous. This needs to be replaced.

  I only use this for YouTube TV and it works great.  YouTube TV has all the cable stations I watched on my much more expensive Direct TV plan. I can stream 3 TV's at a time over my high speed internet connection with no boxes required. Love the unlimited cloud DVR from YouTube TV.  Stores every episode of all my shows for nine months. Ordered Amazon Fire Stick first but it did not work with YouTube TV so I sent it back and ordered this which works wonderfully. The included Remote works good too.

  I had major connectivity problems since my modem is on the other side of the house and I live in an unincorporated area of my city.  The service technician from Spectrum advised me to look into something to boost my internet capability, so I went on Amazon and starting reading about what was available.  The Roku stick was one of the least expensive and also plugs right into the side of the TV, so I don't need more space to place it.  Immediately, I was streaming without interruption like never before.  I am sold and highly recommend this item.

  I bought this to watch the superbowl and Roku drops Fox 2 days before the game, when it was specifically advertised by both Roku and Fox that it would stream the game in 4k HDR. Returning for a firestick, which is apparently now the only way to get the game in 4k without paying for a service.

  Who needs cable or satellite especially if you can’t afford it? This is my second Roku streaming stick and I couldn’t be happier. It’s too cumbersome to move my current Roku streaming stick from the living room TV to bedroom TV every time I want to watch one or the other so I snatched this one up for a great Black Friday price. Just like the other one it was a snap to set up and took less than fifteen minutes from start to finish. And that included downloading the 265 channels already in my account. Cheap, endless entertainment for all tastes with much of it free, at a nominal cost or for small monthly fee (like Netflix, etc). Spend as much or as little as you like. Cheap, quick and easy. What’s not to love? One note though: you must have internet and you’ll need the code for your WiFi for set up. Once you enter that code and follow the onscreen instructions you’re done. You have to login to Roku’s website to set up an account and also enter a code that will appear on your TV screen during setup. No worries, it’s all good. And very easy.

  The stick doesn't seem to work well with my 55"" LG TV. After the first day the screen would occasionally just reboot itself as if it had lost its power source temporarily. I moved the stick to a smaller set in my bedroom and it performs extremely well. The problem might have been caused by something I did but I can't imagine what it may have been. I ordered a ROKU Premiere for the larger (55"") set and it is working great.The product was shipped right away and arrived in perfect condition but because of the problems I had with it's performance on the larger screen I can only give it 3 stars.

  Overall I like the Roku products, but there are a couple of challenges I have faced with this.1) It doesn't like my Samsung TV's HDMI port, despite it being HDCP 2.2 port.  Thus it refuses to do 5.1 surround playback.  I had to hook it up to my receiver to get surround.2) I'm seeing some strange issues where video cuts out to a black screen periodically during playback.  It only lasts a split second, but still distracting.  Not sure if this is a compatibility issue with this and the TV or what, but the older streaming stick didn't seem to have issues.  My native smart TV also doesn't have issues.

  I love Roku, but this model infuriates me because of the number of times I have to re sync the remote. It's not even a simple sync where I just push and hold the button in the battery chamber. Each time I must do a hard reset by unplugging it from behind the TV. I would have rather kept the older model with the remote receiver.

  Not possible to connect to an external audio device, Bluetooth or otherwise, except over the Roku app, which would in turn require a second smart device at all times. The next model up has an audio jack, which wasn't a luxury worth the extra $40 before planned obsolescence took over every new product in your house.

  The Roku is great, but obviously Roku doesn't make sure the supplied remote batteries are fresh. Received Roku on Nov. 22. On Friday Nov. 24 I could see the home screen but could not make any selections. Figured it was bad batteries. Luckily I had some AAA in the junk drawer. I live 45 minutes from town and it would have been unfortunate to make that drive for 2 lousy batteries. I figure new product, new batteries.

  Watch twitch on this and it will eventually start buffering and get frozen.

  Plus, there isn't a number to call to speak to anyone!!  Even though you have to have it for Spectrum, I can't believe there isn'y a quick way to be able to contact customer service!  In my opinion, they are hiding something. you can only email the company.

  Two months after getting it, my Roku Stick has already stopped working.

  I really like the Roku Streaming Stick.  It is easy to set up, and Roku does not have conflicts with services like the other leading streaming app does, (no not Slingbox, the other one).  Easy to use.

  After a few hours using it, the device overheats and shuts down.I also did a search on internet and this is a very common problem with this design.It looks like this version has a design problem I had an older version and I never got overheating issues, big disappointment from Roku.

  This product won’t sync with the phone app and when I’m on a channel and turn it off it resets to the “popular” channel of their choice, categories that I’ve never watched. I warn all my friends not to buy this

  Love it! Great for streaming directtvnow. Ordered three and also have a roku tv. Easy user intuitive interface. Easy to understand why a Roku owns the market. Have used Apple TV 3 and 4, fire stick and chromecast. The roku stick + remote controls power, volume, inputs, changes channels. Fire stick remote doesn’t control sound, Apple TV 4+ touch pad is too sensitive I’m inadvertently  changing channels.

  I wanted to love it as a second Roku for the bedroon, but it will not connect to wi-fi.  An older version works fine on every tv, this new one won’t connect with any tv in the house.  Called Amazon tech and the only solution was a refund.  Back to the older model.

  I love my Roku stick. I don't think I would pay the extra money again to have one with a voice remote. That part is a little awkward to use. I have 3 televisions in my house and I have purchased this product for all 3 of them.

  This item is installed in a tv directly above a router. Wireless function has never worked. Within less than 2 months it doesn’t work at all. I am concerned I was sold a used product when I ordered a new product. Now it is past the time when I can return it.

  
"

  The device itself is fine.  Trouble is, the remote kills a set of batteries in just a couple of days even when left on a desktop unused.  The Roku app for iOS tells me I'm not connected to wifi every few seconds despite having a strong wifi signal that works fine for every other device I own, so I have to go to settings and then back to the Roku app.  Oh joy.

  I love the ease of installation/registration of the device.  Also, since we purchased this particular device after much research, I love that there is a button on the remote for Hulu, Sling, and Netflix.  I don't have to constantly click back and forth to the Roku home screen.

  I had this set-up on one TV, inches away from the router, and it was iffy.  Powering the unit from the TV is hit or miss, and using the device was not a joy in any event.  So I move it to the kitchen, in a nearby room.  Set-up has proven impossible.  First, the Roku is a thoughtful object, often pausing to consider its next move for a good half a minute.  Restart the unit.  Good idea, except now you pass by one option which, without choosing it, prompts the device to ""Connect to Network"" which the whole point of the restart is it's not connected.  After satisfying itself that it was not connected, I was permitted to go to wireless set up.  The device often paused for another half minute between password character entries to contemplate the wonders of the universe.  The installation guide says the remote will work through a TV, necessary since the device connects to the back and I, for one, prefer to watch from the front.  It does.  Sometimes.  This is with pretty fresh Duracell batteries and a small kitchen TV.  The device said it had a strong signal. but never connected in the other room.  But I least with have a new remote, so there's that.I give it two stars because the idea of Roku is much better than paying the cable company $100 a year, per TV, for the privilege of watching what you already pay for, and it did sort of work on one TV.

  Even with the extended range attachment the connection was spotty at best, the mouth and sound was off on Netflix, hulu, and definitely on prime, then they wouldn't even connect, except for a lagged out prime where everything costs money to watch.  I would most likely go with Roku over this piece of junk.

  I bought this to replace my first Roku which I have had for about five years.  So far, I have had no problems with it.  I have plugged into the 4K HDMI socket on my 60"" Visio.  I get great quality video and have had no problems with the WIFI connection.  With my older Roku, I was not able to upgrade various channels like Netflix or Hulu or MLBTV.  With the Roku streaming stick, I can now have multiple users on Netflix and Hulu.

  The remote battery drains in a week or so. I changed it and it happened again. I am not using enhanced remote.

  Spectrum has made it where the consumer has to rent one of Spectrum's cable boxes for each television.  If a TV is mounted on the wall, it makes it very difficult to have one of their boxes without unsightly wires and some type of table by the TV.  Plus, if you have several televisions, the cost  adds up rather quickly.  Roku is a great alternative since there is a Spectrum app that comes with the Roku products.  Now we watch cable TV wirelessly.

  Dislike the fact that if you buy 2 of these units or more you have to pat an additional charge of over $100 to use both units.  Typical amazon they leave off the fine details like this.  Roku you might have a good product, but your false/misleading advertising is typical of ALL tv services.  Hidden Fees!!!!

  It’s awful.  We almost replaced a TV because we thought the HDMI ports were bad.  Then we had issues with a brand new Samsung TV In our bedroom.  I’ve literally tried everything to get the remote to work on both televisions, hard reset then  repaired it, changed the batteries, changed WiFi networks, changed HDMI extender, bought a new unit.  Nothing works.  The technology is awful.  Our experience has been so bad we stopped watching television.

  The product works great overall.  We wanted to use it on our home theater system but it won't work.  The sound only goes through the tv.

  The interface and options on the TV are great. We love having everything in one place BUT the remote itself does not work. Everyone in my family has downloaded the remote app, which works just fine but does not turn our tv on and off. Frankly, it doesn’t matter how great the interface is if you can’t access any of it with the remote. Note that we actually have 3 of them and bought extenders that supposedly helps the remote work.. total waist of money.

  Perfect if you don’t care to waste your money on cable TV. Only problem is every once in awhile when you click a title to watch to sound goes mute. You have to back out of the title and click back on it then it works just fine. Not sure what that’s about but other than that no complaints.

  Its great for streaming wherever you go only downfall is ruku don’t have vpn so your accounts gets blocked in foreign country so you have to bring a wireless travel router with vpn or use phone hotspot with vpn on. lot's of data used 35 gb in a week and that was late nights and mornings for kids.

  Have used this a month and find it to be an exceptional addition to my my Smart TV.  It's function is intuitive and it is quite quickly responsive.  Have used two previous Roku and an Apple TV.  Much prefer this device and the price is very good.

  I am not happy with this stick. It seems to overheat and I keep getting an overheating warning. A few months had elapsed since my purchase and use. Amazon doesn’t let me return this.

  Good product.  I have not integrated with Amazon.

  
"

  I’ve been wanting a roku for awhile and researched the different options available and decided to go with this stick version. Very happy with it so far and was surprised to see how many free titles roku offers themselves for free too.

  
"

"

  Ended up replaceing this with a Roku

  
"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Amazon fire stick is waaaaay better and easier to use than the Roku.  The software is clunky and not user friendly.

  
"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  ... got a replacement from Amazon, followed ALL instructions/efforts with Am. tech rep. , still no joy. Very frustrating... so much for plug n play ... researching on web, lots of sites/pages have 'support' for all thes ROKU connection issues. Not worth to time, effort and money

  
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The remote compatible with the stick stopped operating properly after only 15 - 16 months.  Both power button and volume control ceased to function first, followed by the other operating buttons.  Does not seem to last long and not sure what to do ?  Should they be sending us a replacement or do we have to search out the correct replacement.  Something like this should not just cease to work after such a short period of time.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This roku stick is so simple to use. Just plug it in and watch your shows!  No box sitting out on your tv. Voice search is awesome. You dont have to do all that typing in....  i would definitely buy this again.

  This long range version is so fantastic... I have other Roku devices and this is by far the best even though they are all great... I wish they were all this style... Works so well even far from the WiFi router

  
"

  I didn't have to do anything like jumping through hoops with this device. Plug and play. I dont know why I didnt do this a long time ago. Thank you Roku. No more paying for crap I will never watch. Rock on

  Only negative is that it interferes w/ my digital antenna signal.  I have to unplug it in order to watch regular/network/local TV thru my digital antenna w/o losing video/audio signal.

"

  This is also perfect I tried many others however no frustrations, it plugs and play and it gets on the channels no hassle, nothing else to buy, unless you want Bluetooth even that easy plug and play. I have mine hooked up to it a projector perfect.

  Great way to help cut the cord.  Lots of free options.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I bought this one to replace an older version. One of the streaming shows I watch was loading very slowly. This one is very fast and has voice command, which makes browsing much easier. It works great with my Onkyo receiver. Highly recommend it.

"

  After a couple months, all the sudden the remote wont work the roku.  When I reset and follow the online problem solving instructions,  it goes back to the setup screen and it just freezes.  The remote willnkot pair with the devise I'm assuming but I get no response from Roku support.

  I had a small TV not in use because I wasn't paying to get another cable box. Put it on my kitchen counter with fire stick & it's perfect. I love that it's portable. If I need the space I can unplug & move it!

  Bought this when building cable bundle expired and prices were going to be even higher. Does just what I need, offers streaming apps for everything so far. One of the best features is it integrates with my Harmony Home Control, so except for a few functions I don’t need to use the roku remote.

"

  Works great. I don’t like how some channels log you out and you have to go to the website to log back in but other than that it’s great.

  Worked fine for the first month, then I was unable to establish a connection. Followed all of their suggestions to enable me to get a connection to no avail. They expect you to pay shipping back to them for a replacement. I would have preferred to have received help by phone but was unable to connect with them. I am now out $50 but I am able to connect to Amazon and Netflix using my tv's  wifi and therefore don't even need the Roku without any aggravation. I have read other reviewers ratings reporting the same problem I ran into.

  It’s Forcing me to give it one star I give it zero. I thought I could buy the device and I could hook it to my Element TV. Could not get the remote to work so called “FREE” support. Turns out they want a one time $70.00 setup charge. Not a chance!! This should  advertised when selling this product. Going to return it. What a rip off!!

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  It's a great stick for streaming. For us, the Roku stick one step down worked as well. We didn't need the 4k. But love the results we are getting- clear picture, sound, easy to use remote.If you don't need the 4k, save $10

  
"

  This stick saves me 10 dollars a month paying rent for a Xfinity box plus alot of other free streaming live TV and movies. I liked the 1 so I purchised another. Saving 20 dollars a month for Xfinity boxes

  Tried giving this product a chance after hearing and reading some reviews of how this product works. And I hate it. It’s a waste of time and money. It wouldn’t connect to my internet no matter what I do to fix it. I have 3 amazon fire sticks and they are way better than this. Would like to return this item. Would not be giving roku any more of my money.

  DO NOT BUY!!!! The remote NEVER works. Every time I try to use it the remote refuses to respond. What is the point of having this if you can’t use the remote when you want to? I talked to amazon about this and they told me this is normal. Save your money have buy a different brand than a fire stick.

  I wasn't sure what to expect. After installation, I was hoping for more options on the remote such as program information on each show. Also, I thought there would be more recent movies and programs, however it does work well and is fine for my secondary tv.

  I purchased the roku stick to replace an amazon fire stick that went bad. In fact I had 2 amazon fire sticks that went bad in less than a year.  I now prefer the Roku over the Amazon fire stick.  Do your self a favor and get the roku.

  I am not a huge techy so I honestly didn't think I would like this. But it's awesome! I love having the voice remote as it makes things a lot simpler. Why pay for cable with something like this? LOL

  I'm happy to use the Roku stick as an alternative to buying all new smart TV's. The newer features on the remote like voice command, volume control and power on/off are nice. However my remote only lasted 5-6 months before failing. Something inside is loose and rattling around. I can use the Roku app on my phone temporarily but now have to buy a new remote.

  Unfortunately our remote and roku don’t seem to be working correctly and although we can get it to work sometimes, it is not consistent which is an unfortunate quality in a remote. Upon realizing that the issue was not something I can correct, it was too late to return, therefore I am very disappointed as I am stuck with a device that does not work correctly.

  Had constant problems kicks itself off the Internet.  The remote control has to be continuously reset.  Roku technical support is not that helpful, Call them multiple times in spend 40 minutes on the phone resetting everything.  I'm expecting them to be broken again within 2 to 3 days.  I have had for 3 weeks and they seem to break every couple .  Something brand new and not refurbish should last a lot longer than this

  I am a user in Japan and am only able to use Netflix and Youtube. Nothing else!! There was no such prompt at the time of purchasing, which I think should have been mandatory. Its just over a week or so that I am using the product, and so far the streaming quality is quite admirable and the set up was quite easy; however, I would not have purchased this product had I known that most of what is being touted cannot be used outside US. Have paid too much for too little......but like they say in these parts .....Shoganai!

  I originally got the Ultra, but after months of frustration with HDMI connectivity issues with the Ultra, i decided to get the stick in order to avoid connecting with an HDMI cable. It worked.  The Roku stick works great.  The Roku interface is the most intuitive....much better than Apple TV (which goes for cool rather than intuitive) or various smart TV interfaces which are generally awful.  Roku is able to get all the apps you want.  I have yet to find a channel it doesn't get.As to the Ultra, I would avoid it.  It works for a while and then out of nowhere it tells you your HDMI cable is not compatible. You need version 2.2.  I kept buying new HDMI cables to meet the stated requirements.  But it was always the same story.  After a while the Ultra would reject my new cable and refuse to show the streaming video I was trying to watch.  It did this on YouTube TV, HBO, Showrime and Amazon Prime channels.  I changed screen resolution settings, rebooted, reset...nothing worked as the Ultra is a flawed design.So save youself the headache and buy the Roku stick, which works very well.

  I have xfinity and is used on a second TV.  It mirrors the cable on the first TV.  If you have a DVR on the first TV and record shows, they will also be available on the second TV.  Nice features and you own it so you do not have to rent additional box from the cable company.  Voice commands do not seem to work well.

  ZERO stars is what this company deserves. I bought a Roku Streaming Stick+ from Amazon on 10/16/17. It worked flawlessly for about five months. Now the remote disconnects regularly and I have to reconnect it several times each evening. In addition, I constantly get a message on my TV screen that the Advanced Wireless Receiver is not detected. Sometimes, I have to to unplug and re-plug the Advanced Wireless Receiver as many as a dozen times before it will work...briefly before it malfunctions again. These problems with the remote and the Advanced Wireless Receiver (both items covered by Roku's One-Year Warranty) have persisted for weeks.I got in touch with customer service quoting the device number and explained the problems with the defective Roku in detail. The only response I received were silly suggestions that other Bluetooth devices may be interfering with my Roku. This is ridiculous. The Roku worked perfectly for months and I have not introduced any new devices with Bluetooth into the room. My recent problems are due entirely to malfunctioning Roku components, not interference from other devices. My internet connection is working just fine as well. I'm not having issues with any other devices in my home that connect to the Internet.I have repeatedly emailed Roku to ask them to honor their One-Year Warranty and send me a new device to replace the broken one. Thus far, they have acknowledged my emails with ""Your request has been updated. To add additional comments, reply to this email."" but no further response.I have tried calling Roku's toll-free customer number, but over several hours it has been a constant busy signal. I got in touch with Amazon Customer Service to see if they could help me speak to someone at Roku. They tried to contact Roku over the phone, but got only the same busy signal as I did.I have bought many Roku products in the past and - until recently - I would have recommended them to anyone. My opinion of this company has changed completely. They make an inferior product which malfunctions in less than a year. They do not honor their clearly advertised One-Year Warranty against defective parts. Roku employees instead give long-standing customers the run-around and refuse to deal with their legitimate complaints. They withdraw customers' ability to contact the company by telephone. They are behaving very much like a company that is about to go bankrupt and can only hide and cower from irate, dissatisfied customers. I would strongly advise against spending your hard-earned money on any Roku product. Unless Roku's response to customers improves dramatically, Amazon should seriously consider withdrawing all Roku products for sale on their website.UPDATE: 5/8/2018 To date, Roku has STILL not honored their warranty. Roku tech support is the worst! I will never again buy a Roku product. At least with the Amazon Fire TV Stick, I know Amazon will stand behind their product and that I will be able to talk to an actual human being on the phone if ever I experience a problem with my device.

  I would like to give this more stars because it is good...when it operates like it should. My problem is that I keep getting error messages stating some error with the HDCP then the screen turns purple. It's so annoying. I have called Roku several times and Everytime I am instructed to unplug everything then reconnect...which helps for like half a day then the message appears again. I demanded something else other than temporary measures to be done to fix this and all I have so far is ""we'll get back to you"" but they haven't

  We recently switched from SlingTV to YouTubeTV and our older generation Streaming Stick didn't provide the YouTube TV app. It would work by streaming from our iOS device to the stick, but that was not the preferred method for our family. Amazon offered same day delivery, and the cost is still very appealing, so we upgraded and have been extremely satisfied. We have download speeds in the neighborhood of 6mbps, butYouTube TV through the Roku delivers a great picture. It's typically better than what the hardwired Xbox One delivers.

  This is the best streaming device I've ever owned. The setup was simple and fast and I was very happy that the Roku remote was able to identify the older 720p obscure brand TV I've got it hooked up too at the moment. The Roku user interface is quicker than I imagined it would be, navigation is fast and lag free.

  The only thing that I do not like is that while something is playing it skips or has a slight delay where as if someone is talking it will skip a few words every 10 to 15 seconds. You will completely miss the meaning of a sentence.

  Truly the perfect product for streaming apps at home. Instructions state  for best quality to have the power going from a wall outlet instead of the tv. I was a little concerned but I went ahead and use the tv as the power source and the quality is great still and no issues.

  stick+ is definitely better than stick, if you don't care much about the price, it's sure bet to get this version, better signal, picture quality, and I think the antenna boost/HDMI cable works

  Great product.  Too bad streaming services lock each other out of streaming channel apps.  Xfinity stream is supported by Roku, but not by Android TV.  Vis-versa for other services.  But Roku gets the job done.  It does however seem to experience hiccups.  Reseting the device makes them go away.

"

  I like the Roku but if you are using it to replace your cable provider think twice. Alot of the channels from cable are only accessible with your cable service. You have to request a code. Might as well just watch it on cable. HBO A&E VH1 need codes. (That I know of so far) Look at the android boxes instead.

  Functionally this a great Roku and one of the best I've used..  The remote has volume and power controls which completely eliminates the need for the TV remove, it even programmed itself by talking to the TV over HDMI.  It's magic!The problem however is that the stupid thing is too long and won't plug into some ports on the back of my Vizio TV because they're in a recessed hole.  This is incredibly annoying because the TV only has one HDMI port capable of 4k @ 60 Hz @ 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 color, guess where it's located?In order to use this on my TV at the best quality I have to buy an adapter that costs like $10-15.  Roku could have included something like this in the box for pennies.

  Sad 2 fire sticks for my tv both wont work.I'll give it to roku it works but be aware, Roku is only wanting to make you pay. Very limited content that is free. Just now used voice control, for Entourage free on prime.Roku routed me out of prime and put me in a 2.99 am episode, if you are not on your toes Roku will make you pay where its free. If you have netflix. Hulu or prime.

  It worked great (5 out of 5 great) for a week, and then the mini USB port broke on Roku's proprietary wireless signal extender cable; now the device is useless because replacement cables are unavailable, and standard mini USB to USB cables are incompatible.  Perhaps the rating would be higher the provided hardware held up longer than a week, and if replacement cables were readily available.

  the fire stick is a good device for streaming I like how you can use Alexa  as part the feature . the stuff that the fire stick can improve on is add more variety on the app store for streaming app and possibly have a volume button  built-in to the remote as shortcut for user.

  Fantastic streaming player.  We went through two Amazon Fire Sticks with Alexa and they both froze up constantly.  I know networking so I knew the problem was not my network nor my internet provider.  I struggled with the Fire sticks for 6 months. They both froze up every 5-15 minutes and finally I caved and bought the Roku.  I have had the Roku for four days now,  it was worked perfectly,  has not frozen up once,  great device

  This is amazing. My first usage of Roku and it couldn't be easier. The set-up is done within minutes and most importantly, the range for Wi-Fi is terrific.

  PROS:  Better than expected picture and easy setupCONS:  Can't do voice search for videos, only movies and TV.  Every week at least one channel drops out and you have to re-enter an activation code.

  Best option out their if you want to make your TV a smart TV.  Great product, but they should send the extension with it, so you don't have to find one when you find out you can not plug in without hitting into other parts of the TV.

  Got this for my mom so she could stream Sling and Hulu instead of using cable. Not only did she love it because of the lack of cables or bulkiness, but she’s not tech savvy and was able to figure out the roku quickly. The fact that the remote can function as the tv remote to change volume and power it on and off is a plus.

  Roku has totally changed the way we watch TV! We are so happy with the variety of options! Most of the content we watch is free, and there is a significant amount of free movies and TV shows to watch! Pluto TV was especially helpful when first transitioning, and keeps growing and adding more content. And the kids content is incredible too. Roku Rocks!

  I am brand new to streaming x 2 weeks, am NOT a technophile and this is the only device I’ve used.  Although nervous about the setup it was super easy and probably took 15 minutes.

  Definitely think roku is more user friendly (but that’s also what I started out with so I guess I am biased), but still definitely worth it! Comes with all kinds of apps you can watch tv in for free without paying for subscriptions. Definitely worth the buy.

  Seems pricey for this little thing.  Roku however is my new jam, lol! I'm still discovering features/content a month in.I do not even use my TV's apps anymore. Those apps and more are here and this supports 4k. I also like roku's formatting of my Netflix, Hulu, etc. apps as well.I paid around $55 +/- I think. That's a lot!While you do get a lot. That's a lot of money.

  This is a great little streaming stick. I have all my favorite digital channels on this stick. I have notice that one channel  that I always had trouble with no longer tells me it can not stream.  And the stick back of my t.v. and out of sight.

  Not really what I expected! Doesn’t have as much as channels as what it shows on the pictures. I am not going to say that wasting your money. Basically 80% of the shows inside need to pay for monthly! If so, open an AT&T’s cable for monthly will be more worth ！

  I have never owned a Roku before and always used my Wii for Netflix.  I love this for several reasons.  It plugs into the back of the tv so I don't have an additional box to contend with and it is so easy to use.  Now I can use not only Netflix but a number of other free channels for movies etc. and if I choose some to purchase.  It was easy to install and configure and that is saying a lot for someone that is technically challenged.  I am considering purchasing another one for my bedroom as well.

  After 20+ years of high cost DirecTV we are finally cutting the cord. Started with one Roku streaming stick as I had to convince my husband that he would still be able to watch all of the sports channels through YouTubeTV and add Philo for the Paramount Network and Hallmark for the girls for half the cost of DirecTV. Just ordered our second stick and will be adding more I am sure!

  I never write reviews, but I felt inclined because I’m honestly blown away. I considered buying an Apple TV (I’m an iPhone/Mac owner) but I’m glad that I went this route instead. I was worried about not being able to cast content from my phone to the tv but it does that seamlessly. It also has voice commands so you don’t always have to type out what you search which is a blessing.

  You already know it’s a good product but let me tell you about the remote. It’s awesome. It’s so compact and simple, the buttons are tight, no wobble but they press easily, at this point I’m rambling but it just fits so nicely in your palm.

  Excelente servicio. Muy serios. Embalaje cuidadoso. Llegó antes de la fecha esperada.El único defecto es que el control no se integró con mi televisor Kalley. (Ojalá en una actualización puedan incluir más métodos de configuración). En definitiva una adquisición sin problemas.

  I purchased a NEW product and gave to someone out of state as a Christmas present.  This product came used, when they hooked up to their tv many of the apps were already signed in and registered to the same user, not allowing them to be logged out of.

  The remote control has no mute button. Having to manually lower the volume when the incessant and obligatory pharmaceutical commercials barrage you is an annoying, battery draining, deal breaker for me.

  Remote keeps losing pairing to the streaming stick +.  If I want to pair the remote again I have to power cycle the streaming stick +.I followed the help on Roku's site and ordered the HDMI extender.  Didn't help.The Roku app will still control the streaming stick +, even after the remote loses pairing.

  It is everything I was looking for, small, portable, easy to set-up,lots of channels available, and the voice control option completes the streaming experience.  Would highly recommend this product and certainly would purchase it again.

  First off I didn’t want a “repackaged “ I bought it brand new. It arrived ripped open and either the remote or the stick is missing. Extremely angry about this.

  
"

  We bought this Roku stick because our new small tv didn't have Roku installed, but we otherwise liked it. The stick was reasonably priced, arrived quickly, and was incredibly easy to install and sync with Roku on our other TVs. Wholeheartedly recommend this product!

  The Roku stick controls the television sound, which is nice,  but for some reason they did not include a mute button.Seems a strange and annoying omission.

  Works great, easy to use, and I love that I can watch shows and movies on so many different apps. Occasionally an error message will appear and my show will turn off, but I’m not sure if that has to do with my internet connection or the Roku. Either way, I can get back into it with no problem.

  I just love my Roku! It beats Fire Stick all to hell. I have NOT had any trouble with it at all. Fire TV Stick I was having all kinds of problems with. It kept throwing me off my WiFi and it work just stop working whenever it felt like it. Roku is the very best! You won’t be sorry if you buy it.

  I’m so glad I finally purchased a Fire Stick. Now it is so much easier to watch shows on Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube. It has taken my older TV to a hole new level of entertainment. And it was easy to connect.

  If you want to save money than the firestick lite is the way to go. You get almost everything you would get with the regular firestick except you don't get TV controls on your remote. Other than that it's good for the money!

  I love being able to access numerous live channels and apps on my t.v.,that was too old to update, until I used this fire stick.  I was able to avoid buying a new television.  Although I have not taken advantage of the voice remote, I will in the future.

  Easy hook up just beed to know how to log in to your wifi, and streaming preferences like Netflix, Amazon, etc.. Also, the power option lets you just use one remote for powering up your tv (doesn’t have to be a roku tv) and eliminates having to use several remotes to only one.

  I am not talking about Youtube TV or Youtube Red here and some times I Utube instead of Youtube, eh? Yesterday the UPS delivered my ""Roku streaming stick + 4K HDR/HD"" $54 on Amazon; so last night I hooked it up; my Smart dumbed down by Google TV is old; it can't take advantage of the + stuff nor will its usb provide enough power to run the Roku stick; they include a 110 power adapter & cord just in case. I knew all this before but bought it to get VOICE CONTROL and the extra Wi-Fi range. I give it three stars; there is NO web browser on this version! You can sign in to youtube on it with your PC. Google will not let Roku access to your accounts; so none of your history or favorite channels show up nor can you up load videos via Roku. It is hard work finding and moving the Utube app to where you can use it. Every thing else on Roku except Utube works PERFECTLY. Big disappointment ""voice control"" won't find any thing on Utube but, it will find anything else that is in there; it will find the Utube app after you get it installed; which is real good because it is impossible to find. I was hoping that I could just say ""Hickok45"" and it would find him; no luck on that but, it does find Utube. Once in Utube with out Google support I can find my favorite channels, add them to a list so they will be there every time(the one thing I could not do with out Roku) it is very hard to work with the Utube app; there are no instructions but before I went to bed I added Hickok45, nutnfancy, some others to a list on Roku/Utube. Very hard work! I did notice as I worked with youtube; Roku was modifying its recommendations for me to watch. So I guess it will improve over time?The ONLY reason for any one with a smart TV to buy Roku is to use the Youtube app and/or Pornhub (Pornhub has the instructions on it on how to install it on Roku; I will up date when I try it, eh?) on your TV. It ain't Roku's fault that they can't make it perfect. They are fighting Google to get it at all and Google will not let me/you give Roku access to our Google accounts to Roku. However Roku knows why we buy it! They could put the Utube app and Pornhub app right in there next to Amazon so we could just click on it to install it. Instead of spending an hour just to find&install Utube, eh? If you have a smart TV Roku is only necessary if you watch Youtube. If you do have Wi-Fi in you house and a dumb TV you might be able to turn that TV into a smart TV if it has ""HDMI"" slot/slots with even a cheaper Roku stick.

  Extremely convenient, portable -this is important because we live temporarily in a furnished rental with no control over TV channel lineup and can take this with us.

  Moved into our new home and wanted to tighten the monthly costs, so we cut the cable cord and are using two of these. One in the main living room and one in the master bedroom. I use Spectrum and Roku has an app that is almost identical to the actual spectrum guides. Happy with this product

  Works perfectly for me. Great price. I had a couple old ones but the remote on one was missing the back and the other was just missing the remote. It was all most cheaper to buy this than a replacement remote.

  This is the second one of this stick and my third Roku device.  I love this one.  Easy to set up and the wifi does seem to work better.  I use one of these on a TV I move around, including outside.  I have not had an issue of it not picking up the wifi.

  Because I don't watch the upstairs TV that often, I chose a stick. It is finicky and doesn't always connect easily to my smart TV. I have to overly manipulate the control to get the Roku on. Once it is on, it works fine.

  Love this!!!!  So easy to use.  You just put the streaming stick in the USB port on the TV, and it automatically starts doing everything for you.  I love that you can speak and it will look for the movie or TV show that you are looking for.

  Excellent product. Very fast and responsive. It made my regular HDMI TV into a smart TV. I love how it uses only one remote to power off/on the TV and is able to control the volume. I don’t even use the remote my TV came with anymore! Set up is very quick and easy. Basically plug and play.

  Works great once it launches but I find it doesn’t come on automatically when I switch from TV to the hdmi port for fire. I always have to get up and physically unplug it, replug it in then it launches the app. Not a huge deal but a bit hokey. Expect more from Amazon.

  I like the overall performance of the fire stick lite it’s streaming is fast not the best like the 4K fire stick but it gets the job done. I think the fire stick lite is for beginners to the streaming world or that young family member that you want to get a gift for.

  We had an original ROKU device which was used on an analog tv, when that tv died we purchased a new HDTV and although the ROKU worked with the new tv, it did not provide HD and that is the reason we purchased the Streaming Stick+.  Love ROKU!

  Worked great for about 2 months and now everytime you want to use Netflix, disney+, or any app, you have to log in again. I have 2 other roku's that don't have this issue.

  Nice portable device with compatibility with nearly all of the streaming service.  Have several other streaming devices and this is the best.  A remote that can control the TV.  Not in wars with other vendors with blocked or unavailable apps.  Great quality and ease of use when compared with other streaming sticks.

  I love Amazon products, works great, the basic firestick has a great price, good image quality, works with the remote control of the TV, the cellphone. For me if you have an older of TV with HDMI this is the best option.

  Don't get the firestick lite. The volume does work unless uou keep unplugging the hdmi cord on the back of the tv. You have to unplug and plug back up for the firestick to come on.

  The setup was a breeze and it has everything that I need to enjoy my time off of work and school. I'm a college student and on a budget, so the fire stick lite was perfect for me.

  
"

  Although I did rely on my son to set it up, I was delighted to have the streaming access on our TV.  I find the controls easy to use and especially like the voice search function.

  
"

  Switched from DirecTV to using fire stick with apps like Hulu, HBOMax, Discovery+. Get everything we watched before plus some for a fraction of the cost. Plus we chose subscriptions with no advertisements. Liked it so much we bought a 2nd fire stick.

  
"

  Very easy to install. Easy handling. Very fast. Voice remote is good. Remote with power and volume is a plus. Overall, great product.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  No more switching remotes for volume and it has lots of great features. I like being able to get to Sling and Netflix with a single button. Controlling the TV power, volume, apps, etc.. with same remote is very convenient. Using other apps like Amazon Prime Video, Pluto, PBS Kids made it easy to cut cable.

  The remote seems to have to somehow re-sync at close proximity (<3 FEET)after the TV has been turned on. This defeats some of the purpose of the remote. Very FRUSTRATING!

  
"

  This was wonderful.  Just wish it came with an instruction manual for the remote buttons.  I had to do an online search for instructions.

  It started freezing only when using certain live streaming apps (FUBO, Paramount+). Now it seems to freeze every time I use it, no matter the app. When it freezes, the only way to get it to work again is to unplug the device from the wall and plugging it back in.

  Device will not connect to network, Roku customer support is nearly nonexistent and the totality of there wisdom is turn it off and back on again. This seems to be a problem with all of there devices after the last update according to the comments we read while trying to address the issue. People shouldn’t buy this.

  I bought this Roku stick for the distance it provides. I originally bought the basic Roku stick and I live in a quad level home, so it would constantly disconnect. This version solved everything and it been great. Perfect picture and never disconnects from the wireless! Highly recommend

  It would be 5 stars if they had a keyboard on the back of the remote to type on, like when you're searching for a show.  Also, it seems like whenever the remote falls on the floor, the systems goes back to ""Home"".

  The problem was that it continually lost its internet connection. It was connected wirelessly, the router less than 5 feet from the Roku stick, with over 400 mbps download speed. I kept getting messages about low bandwidth and that the router was too far from the Roku. Eventually it wouldn't connect at all. That's when I had enough and returned it.

  We connected the stick to a downstairs bedroom wall TV....we have Spectrum cable and wanted to stream our cable to other home areas without paying more cable connections.  We needed to upgrade our WiFi (Netgear) also as it was 5 years old and too weak to cover a large home area.  The stick works great and we love this option of streaming sports games, etc.  A great option for us.

  This fire stick sucks I have 3 other ones and this one by far is the worse. The other ones work fine this one gets hot to easyily and you have to unplug it to get it to work. The other i have are the little box type one and they work perfectly.

  I purchased this item about 2 weeks ago and it delivers as promised. We use a streaming service for most of our TV watching needs, but still wanted access to local channels. Very easy installation(it took less than 5 minutes from package open to ready to use). Reasonably priced and works great!

  Only knock is that the remote doesn't have the numbers to go directly to a station on my local tv app.

  Wish these would last longer. Have to replace a dead remote for $25 then this thing died....It's still way better than cable or Directv

  This started having to be unplugged and restarted soon after purchase. It works but you have to unplug and plug back into hdmi periodically to use, kinda annoying.

  I had a previous version of a ROKU product but this is much better. I was surprised at how fast the stick connected to my wifi. Also the response to voice commands was great. It makes it easier to find programs.

  Audio book is a plus, I would like to see the remote a little bigger, but no deal breaker because my Tv remote works with fire stick so when I misplace my original I am not at a lost. Well done Amazon

  Doesn’t work with Westinghouse tv. Have to unplug the stick from power just to get device to wake up. Roku blows these things out of the water. Fire stick Not even worth my time to get $20 refund it was that trash.

  This Roku makes streaming easy.  I use it to watch Disney+ and Hulu and it works great.  The voice remote works great too!

  I bought a roku for one tv and fire stick for the other. The self-powering fiction through the tv is inconsistent as sometimes it works and sometimes I get a low battery screen. I like the interface of fire stick much better plus fire stick is half the cost.

  Overheats constantly. I have it away from all other electronics sitting by itself and after two shows or a movie I get an error saying it is overheating. I have the other non 4k Roku as well and receive the same issue.Other than that, the streaming quality is good, interface is easy and setup was a breeze.

  I am old school, so I don't have a smart tv. I purchased this after I gave up satellite tv, and it works great. Turned my old tv into a smart tv in a matter of seconds. The apps are basically endless, and it is easy to navigate.

  It works great! Very smooth. I've owned two of the previous versions of the fire stick and this one definitely works better.. I have it in a dorm, where I share wifi with tons of people, and I never have any lag or anything. Plus this one is cheaper than the previous models!

  
"

  It was very easy to install and although there are many features still to explore the initial use is simple. There are so many options for watching your TV preferences and options on pricing for everyone's budget. A good 1st venture into online/streaming TV... mega cool :)))

  This product lasted 6 months and then starting having problems connecting or staying connected to internet. After trying everything under the sun to get it to work.

  I purchased this streaming stick last November and now middle of February and it no longer works. Unfortunately, I didn’t purchase the extended warranty as I’ve never had problems with the Rokus I’ve purchased in the past. HULU offers live tv so I had to upgrade my Roku. Thinking of trying an Amazon streaming stick.

  Was getting screen black outs as often as once every ten seconds when plugged into any of the 4K enabled ports on my Vizio P Series Quantum. I tried all of the supposed ""fixes"", like switching between HDCP 2.0/2.2 and buying an extension cable. Nothing fixed the issue. I had to return it, hopefully will have better luck with a different streaming device.

  Don’t use voice recognition, Interface a little touchy for over 50-60 ish crowd. Must go back and retry again. Love being off cable but wish for Fox News or some straight news channels, even alt news like Newsmax or OAN would be nice.

  Happy to have a Roku that supports 4k hdr10. Disappointed they took features away that were features on my ancient Roku 3 4200x, such as HDMI-CEC, meaning if you now have a tv with a universal remote setting, you can't use it to control the Roku.

  Dislike the fact that it automatically goes to Amazon when you turn the TV on. The previous version left the TV setting the same as when the tv was turned off. Which is better because most time we wish to watch something other than Amazon.

  Excellent product.  Great WiFi range and excellent response.  Also, great to only use the Roku remote for tv volume and power control.  I have this version on two tv.  Great product.  Highly recommended.

  Great product, but be advised that if you want to use the Hd HomeRun app, it is not available. It is available on the Fire Stick and 4K version, but not here. I use this app primarily for my live tv and dvr. I returned the Firestick Lite because of this.

"

  Works fantastically with no noticeable lag or buffering issues.  I got it to replace my chromecast, which stopped loading shows from multiple streaming services and seamed to be overheating when touched.

  The Roku stick just keeps getting better & better ! Ive been with Roku through generations of players & I love each one more & more. Easier to use,  better options, quality & choices. Cable ? Who needs cable!!

  
"

  No smart TV? Not a problem. This takes care of that. Highly recommend. Slight 1 time additional cost to go to the voice command model worth it.

  
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Good but could be better. I love the new remote but I only bought this to use with Plex thinking it's newer so it must be faster that my Roku premiere but I was wrong.

  
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have an older version without voice recognition that works fine (at another location). This version has a mute button on the side that activates too easily when remote picked up-workable but annoying.  Though it was just the way I held the remote but has happen to 2 others while selecting a channel.

  Get any other model. If your power cord goes out you HAVE to get their special cable or the entire thing does not work. Only had mine 6 months and the cord has gone out. New cord is 20% Of the price of a new stick. If I had known I couldn’t use other power cords I never would have gotten this model.

  I love the Roku. Product works very well, no complaints.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I use the streaming stick on the smart TV in the bedroom.  I was concerned that it may not work because our wi-fi is so weak, but luckily it does. It's perfect for my needs and it was a breeze to install.

  
"

"

  I choose this after I bought a Fire stick that didn't had keys to control TV volume and Power. i'm a bit disapointed because it can control the volume but it doesn't have a mute key.It only works with power plug on the wall. and it loads kinda weird.

  I really like that you can stream audio to a Bluetooth device. That allows me to watch while my wife is sleeping.

  This stick will cut out and my TV will say that nothing is connected even though it is still plugged into the back of my TV. Worked well for a while but now is useless unless I keep unplugging and plugging it back in to the HDMI.

  It is the only way I could watch Discovery +. It works just fine. And my photos from my Amazon photo app on my phone is my TVs screen saver when using the Fire stick. That could be questionable depending on your photos! Lol

  
"

  I’m very disappointed in this device. I have two other TVs in my house that have Roku that work great so I thought I would try the fire stick on my third tv. It’s terrible in comparison. It is always “buffering”. Can’t get through a show.

"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I bought this for our tv in our bedroom because our router is too far to reach the other Roku.  Since we installed it, we haven't had any streaming problems.  Terrific and would buy another one.

  Was replacing an older unit with ""New Improved Roku Stick +""  Couldn't connect without their help and all of a sudden I was on a corrupt network that a $179 for three months from Roku could fix for ME.  I questioned this problem to no satisfactory conclusion.  Immediately contacted Amazon for  complete refund.  If they want a subscription cost to allow use the should ask for it up front. not thru the back door.......

  I bought another one for another TV

  
"

  Honestly the best value, I got rid of cable to use the fire stick and I'm honestly happy so far. Everything is great, although the voice recognition can slip up sometimes but that's ok. If you want TV controls get the regular fire stick although it really isn't needed.

  I like most of it but what I don't like is that there is no numbers on the channels. I have to always go into guide to find what's on currently and it takes a great amount of time. If I just ask for it they always just give me things that I have to wait for or record.

  Super easy setup, it loaded all my channels automatically when I signed in to the stick. The only hiccup was the stick would not fit the back of my TV and I needed to order the extender from Roku directly. They shipped it free of charge and I had it in a couple days.

  Firestick was laggy and the amazon/google beef killed the youtube app forcing me to get a new streaming stick. Roku is way faster, smooth crisp streaming, easy interface and simple controller. The choice is easy, go roku.

  I bought this ROKU Streaming Stick because I had the latest version of the same product and that I already knew what ROKU products were. This year my sister wanted to watch Netflix on her HD TV, and this is what I chose to buy for her on sale at Amazon.com for Christmas. Until now, it seems satisfying and it works fine, but for Canadians, the choice of interesting channels is really limited. In Quebec, the most interesting channel is Netflix, and a few rudimentary games. This product is good for Netflix, The Weather Network, but TunIn is a rudimentary App, there is no Spotify for free, no HULU and other similar Apps just like in United States, no Amazon Fire TV App, No Oviguide App, no ROKU Streaming Channel and other interesting American channels as they are not available in the downloads section. Else other things, nothing negative to say, the thing works fine for Netflix.  For Canadians or people from the Quebec Province that do not have cable TV, there is one interesting channel named CanadaTV for 1.99$ CAD/month that is available and with this service you can have main English and French TV channels available in Ontario and Quebec. It is worth it for the price as I do not have CBC on the cable TV in Quebec. I wish that the ACORN TV APP for British series would be 1.99 $ CAD/month too, but it's 4.99$ CAD/month and I can't have it as it is too much paid for combined services such as cable TV, phone and Internet.

  The remote is constantly going out. The volume control will work, but we can't do anything else with it.

  Excellent product. Better than the fire stick. So many different uses. Only issue, if you have a soundbar, you can’t control that volume with this Roku remote. You need to buy the sidekick for $25.

  One week down with “cutting the cord”!  Love it with the Roku. It’s not like cable but our “cable” bill is now $45 per month and not over $200 and we have very fast internet. Comcast..... suck it!!!

  We use it primarily for streaming Prime video and Netflix on our TV. Works way better than the TV's native apps.

  I love this Roku stick, my grandkids love to watch PBS kids on it and I love that I can go right to DisneyNOW or Hulu, etc. I also love Roku TV, they have some great movies! It’s so fun, we’re really enjoying it, it’s well worth the money!

  This Roku streaming stick has really expanded our choice of available  shows.  The only thing we don't like is the number of advertisements.

  It's not that I dislike anything about it it's just the fact of trying to learn a new program. As far as the guide it's just completely different than what I've been used to but we'll definitely figure it out because we are enjoying it way much more than our DirecTV.

  I was unclear whether to buy this one (a deal at $17.99) or the fully integrated fire stick (I already have a few of those).  This works perfectly, and at that price was a steal.

  Without an option to turn the fire stick off, I need to unplug it frequently, otherwise it slows down to the point that is is practically unusable. Otherwise, there’s no complaints. When it is working, it works great and the minor inconvenience isn’t worth being upset over.

  Love it bought a 2nd one planning on a 3rd one cancelled direct TV!

  This device is just what we wanted.  We have a tv in our sunroom on the back of the house and didn't have access to a cable box, so this was the ideal solution.  We stream live with our cable service without having to get another cable box.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  We use this on our tv in our living room, it’s on older LED model, not a Smart TV like we have in our bedroom. I can stream all the same channels I stream in my bedroom, it was easy to set up and have been streaming shows every night since we got it!

  Even with a 4K tv, the change in resolution is negligible. I hardly notice a difference. One issue I have with this roku that I didn't have with the other is the video skips, audio goes out, and I need to reset the Roku unit on a regular basis. Pretty frsutrating. The volume adjustment on the remote is a bonus.

  It would be helpful if there were at least one TV control feature - Volume Control. It's a bit bothersome to switch to the TV remote to turn the volume up or down. Otherwise, everything else I've experienced when using the Fire ""TV"" Lite is of exceptional quality.

  
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Primarily used by my wife, she is not a ""technology"" person especially when it comes to voice controls.  So, the issue is no TV controls for her.  However the price was acceptable and I don't have issues with the device. So, the device as a  compromise works well.

  This product lasted less than 2 years....on crutches. Issues started early on with signal, but a unplugging and plugging back in worked once in a while. The remote did not communicate with the Roku well. Based on my experience with this Roku, PS3, Xbox One, and Apple TV, and Google TV, I would rank this in last place.

  This Roku Streaming Stick Plus will turn any TV into  a Roku TV.  Setup, activation and control of TV no hassle, very easy and quick (under 5 minutes).  Just follow the very simple included directions - that's it.  I have or have had Roku 1, 2, 3, Purple Stick, Black Stick and TCL Roku TVs.  Loved them all and all still work I'm just a tech device junkie.  This Roku is the absolute best Roku I've used yet.  I was amazed that it actually make my super cheap old bedroom TV perform the same as my TCL Roku TVs.  I can turn my tv on/off and control the tv volume with just one remote now. This Roku is super fast also, faster on channel app load and video startup than any of my other Rokus.  This Roku has 802.11ac dual-band MIMO wifi with a super effective wifi antenna.  I have an excellent a/c wifi router, which is a large part of a Roku or any streaming players ability to stream today's high bit rate action videos.  If you still have older n wifi in particular, you may have problems with any streaming device.  So the few bad reviews you see, that the problem, not the Roku. I love this Roku Streaming Stick Plus and want to now get one to replace my Roku Premiere.  Why, because it is so easy to use.  Spouse, family and friends can work this one remote Roku will no problem.  None Roku users and new Roku users are going to absolutely love it.

  Finally decided to cut the cable cord and start streaming. Wanting to be able to watch live TV was the holdup. Found several good options. After much research and ""free"" trials of all the live streaming services I found that playstation vue was what I was looking for. This device has the playstation vue app and works great. Good-bye cable.

  This review is for the Roku Streaming Stick+.  As a whole, the Roku stick was a good idea.  I installed it on both of my TVs.  I got rid of all but basic cable for local channels and selected amazon prime as my streaming service.  So I'm saving $60 bucks a month now.  I like looking thru prime and some of the free streaming sites to pick things to watch.  There's seems to be plenty to watch....more than I'll ever have time for.  I really like the fact that I don't have so many commercials to endure anymore.  On Amazon Prime, I don't have to look at any commercials.  On some of the free streaming sites, there are commercials, but only a few per every commercial break (not 5 minutes worth the way cable tv overwhelms me with the same commercials over and over again).  There's only one irritating thing about the Roku that I would change and that's the strange thing that seems to happen to the volume on both of my TVs.  When I'm watching a program or movie,  the volume gets (a lot) louder when music starts to play.  I'm not sure what to do about it.  Also, if there's a free streaming program that has commercials with it, the commercials are way louder than the show I'm watching.  So, I have to watch the volume or else I'm blown out of my seat by the immense volume change.  Still, I like the change we made going to roku streaming sticks.  I look forward to completely breaking from cable in the future.

  Purchased September 3, 2020.  Buttons on remote stopped working October 17, 2020.  Now outside of the Amazon return window (30 days), am left to deal with Roku directly.  Too bad as the idea for the product is great, but this product is not ready for customers...

  I purchased the firestick because I mainly stream my TV viewing from Amazon Prime. Recently I became aware that I could stream Spectrum TV App but.. it's not supported on the Firestick. Very disappointed. That's why the 4 stars.

  I really wanted to like this, but this model has some very serious lag issues between the remote and the stick. After doing more research I learned that this is a pretty common problem with this Roku model. I have a much older Amazon stick which I bought around 3 years ago, which works flawlessly, but sadly at this time it has been misplaced. To trouble shoot, I disconnected every wifi device in my house but the Roku, which was only about 5 feet from the router, then walked up one foot in direct line of the stick, and still had major lag issues. Batteries showed a full charge, and I even changed those but still no luck. A lot of customers who had this same problem (from the very first day like me) said their Roku remote eventually stopped working all together, and sadly a lot of times past Amazon's return date. I like Roku products overall, and I own 3 other Roku devices, (mainly because certain channels I can only get on Roku, that Amazon doesn't yet offer) and all of those remotes work just fine. Roku really dropped the ball big-time on the remote for this model. I wonder if that is why Roku lowered the price more on this one model (at this time) than all of their others. Amazon as always, was super-awesome, (I believe in giving credit, and not just fault, to those who deserve it) and allowed me to swiftly return it for a refund. If you are in the market for a dependable 4K streamer, I sadly do not recommend this model!

  I'm tired of the costs and price increases associated with cable (Comcast) TV.  Bought this product to ""cut the cable"" on the tv located in my bedroom.  There is a lot of free programming but it is mostly indie films or films that didn't make it.  You can purchase ""premium"" programming but there's a monthly fee attached.You can watch local news for free, so there is some options available.  I think more options will become available.One thing though.  If you lose your internet, you have nothing.

  I bought this mainly to watch Directv Now.  It buffers a lot.  The Apple Tv and Amazon Fire TV does not buffer like Roku does.  If you want a set top box to.watch Directv Now DONOT GET A ROKU.

  Easy to use. You may need an hdmi extender as won’t always fit in the tv slot. They offer one for free but they were out of stock when I needed so I had to order one. That was dissapointing but otherwise it is extremely easy to set up and use. We love that it has games on it to play as well.

  I have an older HDTV so I needed to plug this into a power strip to power it(all needed items included in the box, mind you!) but it has been a huge improvement in streaming video app performance compared to our PS4 where many apps would frequently not work at all. This proved that our internet service is okay, but perhaps the wireless technology in the PS4 is just not up to snuff to be a primary video streaming device.

  Cut the cable cord and it was the best thing ever! We have 3 ROKU sticks and everyone is happy. I also have Sling Blue and Orange and Prime. We can always find something to watch for half the price.

  I purchased a Roku mainly to use the Spectrum app to stream my cable to a new tv only to find out Roku removed the Spectrum app 2 months ago because of a contract dispute with Spectrum. Now, I have a useless Roku.

  The unit is constantly under power from the TV so occasionally (once a month or so) it needs to be unplugged to “reboot” - on the plus side it is ready to go immediately when the TV is turned on, no waiting for it to load. The power and volume controls are a nice upgrade 👍

  Got this for a good friend who had virtually shut down his FHD TV for nearly 2 months due to lack of luster in locally televised content.  The TV came back to life with this little Roku Streaming unit.  The user interface (remote and the GUI on the TV) is quite user friendly unlike anything around and his little kid is loving it too!

  The Roku Streaming Stick+ works perfectly. It's responsive and has not failed once.I'm currently living in Japan and unfortunately a large number of the best streaming apps don't appear for download, including Amazon Video. In actuality, only 1/4 of the app specific buttons on the remote, Netflix, is available. Since I only got this because my LG TV's Netflix app stopped functioning and it was cheaper than the LG repair guy's house call cost, it's not a deal breaker, but it's still disappointing.

  Bought the devise as a gift so it wasn't set up for several months. Once it was set up it was only used sparingly for just over 30 days so I was unable to return the devise. Roku products are great but this is the first one that I've had that just stopped working. It would turn on but never move past the bouncing Roku screen.

  I absolutely love this!!! Someone gave this to me as a gift and now no one is using the livingroom tv, everyone prefers my tv with the fire stick

  The rest of the applications and features I have no complaints about but Twitch (an Amazon product) is crashing all the time, forcing me to restart the Fire TV to get it working again. Sometimes it crashes so badly that it needs to be unplugged.

  Muy decepcionado cuando compre este producto en ningún momento me decía era usado ahora al revisarlo el paquete venía abierto el control hasta con las pilas puestas y con cuentas configuradas en Netflix y Disney plus. Muy mal por parte de Amazon

  I often have to restart the fire stick due to it having no sound. It becomes quite annoying to have to stop and reset it.

  It's a waste of money because you have to still pay for most of the channels and most most of the shows/ movies freeze, just suddenly stop or keep buffering. You're also lucky if you can find a stream link. I never use it anymore

  My tv is not a smart tv.. so using the firestick is really convenient in getting connected to all the different apps with one remote. Love the additional free movies without even adding apps. Loving the firestick!

  Roku streaming sticks is user friendly. Follow the instructions on screen for setup and it’s easy. Remote has volume control buttons on the side which is really convenient. My other roku remote does not have this feature. Therefore, I need two remotes for the previously purchased device.

  We already had one Roku Stick + that we use for our gym TV.  But I wanted to get another to add to our home theater so I could install Plex and watch Netflix on our projector.  Previous stick was purchased from big box electronic retailers, but I decided to give it a try on Amazon for this one and compare both products.Conclusion:  This Roku Streaming Stick+ works exactly like the one you buy from anywhere else.  Same great product from different retailer.PROS:  You don't even have to get up to buy it.  If you plan ahead, you can order this product few days in advance than you need.  So this way you have this available when you need it and you don't even have to change your cloths or put on shoes.  You will have this great product waiting outside your front door.CONS: Only bad thing about this is you can't get it right away.  You have to wait until your Amazon shipment arrives.  It could be same day, 2 days or longer depending on your location.  For our older Roku Stick, I was able to go to local store and it was available to use right away.  So unless you have planned ahead, you would have to wait.

  Works as advertised! Use my Roku daily to watch live TV without any issues. Roku is upstairs in bedroom as far away from wifi modem as it can be. I have no signal issues and no streaming issues. Unlike my amazon  firestick. Will definitely be purchasing another Roku to replace my amazon firestick.

  Easy install, the stick was an upgrade from the basic model I purchased 3 years’ ago. Much faster streaming/connection.
