  Love it! However I have issues with it. Apps do crash from time to time, it goes into sleep mode too quickly when paused (probably need to find where to adjust that in the settings or something), and I don’t like not having the most recent whatever showing up on the home page (only Amazon content will show there, maybe another setting? Doubtful). Aside from these minor complaints, it works great! I have Hulu, Netflix, Disney, Prime (of course), and Apple TV accounts. They all work great. Very happy...but....I probably stared at the specs for the lite and regular one for no less than four hours before making the purchase. I knew everything was the same, but the difference between the two is clear: the lite requires you to use two separate remotes for volume and power for the TV, and is it worth $10 to have all that on the very sleek nice Firestick remote. Here is a break down of me living out my decision of trying out the lite:Day 1. I’m not that picky. I can have two remotes. Plus it’s in my home office, not a big room. No big deal.Day 2. Yep, I did lay the firestick remote by the tv and somehow left the other remote on the coach on the other side of the room. It’s just habit. I need to get used to putting them in the same place.Day 3. Why is this so hard to remember. This old remote for my TV doesn’t work very well. Maybe I should have went with the one with everything I need in one remote. It could have solved two problems, because of the aging TV remote. Hmmm.Day 4. Maybe I can duct tape the remotes together. There has to be some way to make this less painful. I’m really starting to regret this decision.Day 5. I’m not sure about any of the decisions I have ever made in my life if this is the type of decisions I am making. I have kids that were planned, maybe I’ve made all kinds of bad decisions that I have just been forcing myself to live with! How could I have not realized how much of a pain it is to keep these two remotes together. Why is that so hard, but now every time I have to hunt for one or the other it is like someone is punching me in the face with a $10 bill pasted to their knuckles. It’s the volume changing from all the office calls (or pausing or needing to do both or one of the other quickly) and sometimes it’s the boss so I can’t be running around the room trying to kill the sound before answering the call. This was a mistake, and I can solve it for $10. I’d pay $20 if I can escape the pain and suffering I have caused myself these five days which feels like five years!Day 6. Return initiated, extra $10 engaged, regular Firestick arrives tomorrow. It can’t get here fast enough! Now I’m cool with not having 4K because the only TVs I would use this on aren’t 4K and the one tv that is had its own apps (its smart like that, and it got a 1300 on the GRE, which is respectable). Let’s just breath and relax with the epiphany of one remote to rule them all, one remote to find them, one remote to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.Day 7. The one remote has become precious to me.So pay the $10. What do you need, ulcers?

  Apart from the price savings, there isn't much to like about the Fire TV Stick Lite.I have a full fledged Fire TV 4k stick, as well as a Chromecast.I bought this Lite version as a sort of spare for screen mirroring (sometimes the screen mirroring function on the Chromecast can be persnickety).I thought the only features the Lite Stick would lack would be volume/power and as I am fine using two remotes, I thought, why not?Here's why -- the Fire TV Stick 4K with onboard on and off seems to ""remember"" which HDMI port it was connected to and to maintain the audio/video connection.Whereas the Lite Version ""forgets."" I often have to turn the TV on or off, or reboot the stick. It's a nuisance.To be honestly, I use both of my Fire TV sticks mostly for mirroring, rather than the onboard Fire TV interface, which I find isn't nearly as responsible and intuitive as using the Amazon Prime Video app on my phone or PC, then mirroring that app to the Fire TV stick.Also, I noticed there were more ads on the Fire TV Stick than there used to be. Yes, I know Prime has ads for paid video content, but since when do we see ads for completely unrelated products like insurance policies?  Very obnoxious.Anyhow, in terms of being able to maintain a mirrored connection, both Fire TV sticks are better at it than my Chromecast, which connects more easily, but occasionally has to be reconnected when the connection drops.However, the Fire TV sticks are much more troublesome in terms of establishing the initial screencast link. For starters, there isn't a shortcut. You have to use the remote to maneuver to the settings menu, select display, select screen mirroring or screen sharing, and then select screen mirroring or sharing on your phone.Really, the  best way by far to use Prime Video is via a hard-wired cable connection from your pc/ipad/iphone/android, if you have the appropriate cable and provided the device you are linking supports MHL video output (which fewer and fewer Android devices support these days).All that said, if wireless casting is your only option and if you absolutely need a solution that is ultra-cheap when it is on sale, the Fire TV Stick Lite does work, provided you have the patience to reconnect it and perhaps reboot it once in a while.Nevertheless, if you can spare a few bucks more, I recommend buying the fully-fledged Fire Stick 4k rather than the lite version.

  I bought this to replace an old Roku that was giving me trouble, thought this would be an upgrade. Unfortunately, this is way more of a pain than the Roku has ever been. It almost never wants to play sound, which is incredibly irritating. I have to unplug it and plug it back in constantly, though that doesn’t even work most of the time unless I leave it unplugged for several hours or even days. It’s also a big pain to go back to a show you were watching. You have to click through all the channels, find the show, then try to figure out which one you were watching. It looks like you’ve already watched shows you didn’t see, the line across the bottom shows up on ones you never watched. If you were watching a series, most of the time it will jump several shows ahead so you have to go back and fast fwd through a bunch of episodes to figure out where you were. Sometimes it will randomly start playing in the middle of an episode you haven’t watched when you turn it on. I bought Discovery+ through this and can’t access it through my Roku, so it’s annoying when I want to finish a show but can’t get any sound. With everything technology is capable of these days, it’s amazing that not even the most basic things (like sound) will work. Too late to return it. Glad I at least bought it on sale since it’ll likely end up in the garbage. For now I’m back to using the old Roku as even that works way better than this thing. Extremely disappointing! I will just buy another Roku in the future. The idea and ability to get many different channels is great, if they could only get it to work consistently and fix some of the annoyances. Not worth having to keep unplugging it and plugging it back in several times just to hear the sound. Today I’ve done that 6 times and it still won’t work. At least my Roku plays sound.

  This is my first streaming Stick, I've previously used Roku stand alone devices. I did not need TV on/off or volume control etc so I went with the Lite. The main reasons for buying the Stick are: to evaluate the Fire user interface and try the Silk browser (Roku does not support a browser).The Stick was connected at the back of my AV receiver (using the supplied extension cord) within an AV cabinet, a less than ideal situation. Despite the Stick being surrounded by a jumble of receiver wires, that you might expect to effect RF signal strength, the remote worked fine and I obtained a Very Good WiFi signal indication.Stick setup was easy. The Fire homepage is arranged differently to Roku but is no less usable. The only omission is a complete lack of time & date info on the homepage or screensaver, something I'm used to with the Roku. The speed of operation is similar to Roku.The Silk browser works great. I use it to navigate to radio station homepages and bookmark the URL. While on the subject of radio stations, the Fire TV TuneIn app is not as comprehensive as either the Roku or Kindle tablet versions, with a lack of Recents and Favorites. However, the Fire TV iHeart Radio app is better than the Roku or Kindle tablet (go figure?) versions but it still lacks several local major stations. So between using Silk and iHeart I'm able get all the stations I need.The ESPN app took two attempts to load (load, fail-to-start, uninstall, re-load) but eventually worked fine. So far I'm impressed with the hardware and I've managed to overcome any software imitations.

  After evaluating several streaming devices, I’ve determined the Firestick is my best option with the most features and performance for a reasonable price. Especially with this new 2020 release, it performs faster and with fewer glitches than previous gens. I recently focused on the TiVo Stream 4K because I liked the way their search engine would aggregate content from all streaming sources, so you wouldn’t have to search individually through Netflix, Hulu, Apple+, Amazon Prime, etc. to try to find a movie.But guess what? Amazon has incorporated a new search that will do the same thing with this new release! If you notice, TiVo is so nervous about this they quickly dropped the price on their Stream 4K from $49 down to $39.....for BROKEN hardware. Read on.The main focus of my testing is surround sound capabilities. I use an OTG (On The Go) micro USB cable to plug in my thumb drives to the Firestick. I am then able to play my 5.1 audio files encoded as Dolby Digital AC3, DTS, FLAC, WAV, SACD-DST etc. Firestick DOES PLAY and properly decode all of these via the terrific “Kodi” player app. TiVo’s Stream 4K also plays these files, but even though it DISPLAYS a 5.1 Dolby Digital+ decode it is REALLY only playing in just TWO CHANNELS! Even a standard stereo two channel mp3 shows being played back as full Dolby Digital+ 5.1....FAIL!But the problem with the Amazon Firestick is its inability to read anything other than FAT32 formatted drives natively. EVERY other streaming device I’ve tested can read NTFS drives natively. Yes, there is a workaround by playing files through the “ES File Explorer” app that then plays through Kodi, but you can’t sequence playlists, and for each file you need to hit the home button to get back to the ES app to then load another file....NO GOOD!The other big issue with FAT32: files are limited to 4.2 gigs in size. FAT32 cannot read anything larger. So if you have a movie larger than 4.2GB you’re out of luck. So outdated.Amazon crew members, get on the “Stick” and add native NTFS support!

  I bought this to replace an old, 1st gen fire stick. It's only used on a small unsmart tv in our bedroom so I didn't need all the extra tv controls or 4k. The 1st gen has just gotten too slow and unreliable as it has aged, even after resetting it, so when the ""birthday sale"" came along I stepped up. WOW! What a difference in speed! I also have a 4k stick for the main living room tv and this actually seems a little quicker than it. Setup was easy, though you do have to be patient while it first downloads and updates during the setup process. There were a couple of times I thought it gave up, only to have it suddenly continue on. Anyone that's still using an old 1st gen I strongly suggest upgrading. You won't be sorry!

  (Clarified on 2/15/21 due to the 4 emails I received from Amazon, Notifications on my Alexa, and CALL I RECEIVED AT WORK FROM SOMEONE AT AMAZON Cus Care - I am grateful but it says to me you already are aware of this product)No one explained to me in the store (Purchased at Staples where it was marked down to 21.50 as the prices are fixed to mirror Amazon.com) so that this could not actually control the volume of the monitor in my bedroom, only that it did not have advanced connectivity for sound and only HDMI (I am not sure if this device is any different at all, or it just comes with a less feature filled remote.) -- which I thought would be fine as that is all the Gen2 Firestick that I had did.  I needed a secondary device to my AppleTV and I thought that this would be worth the money. It is worth the 21$ to just add a tv easily BUT THERE IS NO INTEGRATION AT ALL, so it is a bit of a disappointment. This model is a bit underwhelming overall. Wish I had spent the extra 10$ on a standard fire stick so I could lower and raise the HDMI volume without having to get out of bed as this monitor has no remote.PS. Dear Amazon, WHY WOULD YOU THINK 6 months of ""food TV"" videos free, is a selling point. Get it together Amazon. This is like a bargain basement product, and you sold It like one. I already have Prime and Cable, and I dont cook so that is useless to me as I would imagine it is to 98% of the other users, which I HOPE you are paying for per activation, not some huge volume license, as again, WHO WOULD EVEN WATCH IT!

  So overall this thing is great, easily portable, gets all the apps we couldn’t on our TVs BUT, I don’t know who decided the cord length but it’s not even close to long enough for most applications. If you have your tv wall mounted you’re probably going to need an extension cord. Major annoyance and downfall.

  I bought this 3 weeks ago my son finally installed it kids they take forever to do something lol so we had a very old roku box and it started acting up so I got this to replace it. We've always used roku but decided to go with the firestick. It was easy to set up and boy let me tell ya this thing is super fast compared to our old roku box. I had to tell my son to slow down so I could see what's on the screen lol he was jumping around to different screens and apps so fast. The picture quality is real good also and our tv is about 6 years old. I'm thinking about getting another one for my tv upstairs it's a roku tv and works great but it's not as fast as the firestick and doesn't have the voice activated remote which my son really likes with the firestick.

  My fire stick light didn't work it kept powering off I thought it was the remote or maybe the power wires that came with it so I hooked my other fire stick up to it the old one and it worked perfectly fine with the new power wires and remote so it was the fire stick itself I've tried calling Amazon but haven't got in touch with them to do a return and I have been too busy this month and with being hospitalized to put that return fire stick at the top of my priorities list.

  I've never been a fan of the Fire TVs/Sticks compared to other streaming devices, but had started using one since HBO Max and other apps weren't available on the Roku.  I just ordered this FireStick for a downstairs to TV, but had been using a previous years model without too much issue on another TV.I set the new TV Stick is installed 3 feet from a large home router with high speed broadband.  It took several attempts to connect.  When restarting the FireStick it reports no connection on startup then finds the router about a minute later.  Tring to launch HBOMax takes 6 minutes for the main interface, another 5 minutes to start a program, then it freezes every 5 seconds.  I use the older model FireStick 50 feet away from the same router without this problem.Also can not use ESPN app on the FireStick, since it will not accept SlingTV provider login.  It looops back to a blank login page after  entering credentials (which is a painful process with the FireStick onscreen login page and remote).

  I bought this solely so I could listen to audible on my tv, if I had known that I couldn't browse my library and that audible is controlled solely by voice command, I never would have bought it. Besides the audible issue, firestick tv really sucks, it's very chaotic, if you want access to everything, I would save up and get the nvidia shield pro, if you want something close to the best minus hbomax, buy a roku 4. Firestick tv misses the mark on everything.

  You get what you pay for, in this case you get a 20$ piece of complete trash. Where do I start, how about the audio: I’ve never had a more incompatible device. Want to use Bluetooth headphones? Tough. Unless you want them blasting in your ears at full volume you need headphones with on board volume control. Now if you have headphones with on board volume control they will work but they will sound like utter crap and in my case the audio only comes out of the left channel (skullcandy wireless headphones). It also pops, cracks and cuts out every 10-30 seconds and has insane audio lag that constantly changes, so expect to mess with your TVs lip sync feature (if it has one) about 2-5 times and hour. I’ve also tried to connect a Bose Mini BT speaker. It connects but has the same pop/click issue. I tried using the aux-in on the Bose and my TVs audio out with zero sound. So enjoy your crappy tv speakers.The video: the video quality is pretty awful. I get weird red scan lines and all sorts of other glitches. It has major frame rate drops...I’m sorry why does this piece of crap exist from one of the biggest tech companies in the world? And every new version seems to be worse. I have an older version that does not have the same video problems but same with the audio issues. Save your money and buy something better. Or if you buy it don’t even open it. Just put it right in the trash.

  The older similar device this one is replacing rarely had trouble with wifi/internet connections. This one never wants to launch Hulu. Or it will start and then give a message about ""can't find"" or ""can't connect to that service at this time"". Or it asks me to login to the services again. In both cases making it restart fixes it for a while. Sometimes Echo Dot can control it, sometimes it says I should go back to the Alexa app.This one is supposed to be the one without TV? Or maybe not replace the TV's remote. I don't know. I don't need either.It's the layout of the buttons. Logically the Home button should be at the top or the bottom (larger?) so you don't have to look to press it. No, they put it up from the bottom, between other buttons so I have to look each time. The one at the bottom, I don't know what that is. Something to do with live TV.It does feed a nice picture and clear audio to my old Sharp TV.

  I've been using this a few months now.Pros (when it works):1. It streams some apps better and faster than the same apps via smart TV.2. Alexa's voice recognition has a pretty high accuracy, though there's room for improvement.3. The device is easy to set up.4. It's a good workaround for older TVs with specs too outdated for some channels, like iMDB TV.Cons (here we go):1. No disabling/adjusting sleep mode. Amazon refuses to add an option to turn OFF sleep mode, despite being given legit use cases for doing so in Amazon forums for the last couple of years. Want to leave it on for pets when you go out? Forget it. Have a business where the display needs to remain on? Nope. Or maybe you're like me and forget the TV is on because the screen is black. CAN I JUST SAY HOW ANNOYING THIS IS? You either have to root it, or install a 3rd party app (some of which also disable the screen saver).2. Interface text is SMALL. Like, really, REALLY unnecessarily, stupidly small. The last update did this, and there was no functional reason for it, just a designer decision of aesthetics over user need. So I guess older users, those with distance vision issues, or who have to place the TV a distance away don't matter.3. Given the brief time I've had it, I've had to restart it more often than I should have to. Captions will stop syncing up, audio will go out, or the video will freeze. This is while using Prime or Netflix, which BTW doesn't happen when I use the same apps installed on my Smart TV.4. The controller is small and very black, so it's super easy to lose, especially if you watch TV in low light or have dark furniture. I've had to add bits of fluorescent duct tape and glow tape so I can find them easier (or you can buy a brightly-colored silicone skin for it). And it's too curved to be able to stick any kind of location tag to it.I bought two, so obviously I didn't hate it. But this lack of responsiveness to good use cases and making changes nobody asked for that makes it less user- friendly are real issues.UPDATE: 4 months in and one is already broken. How convenient, when the warranty is 90 days.After about a minute, the screen freezes, and then the Fire Stick powers itself off completely! (Tried clearing the cache, soft reboot, hard reboot, restart the TV, even a factory reset - and problem persists.) Really, REALLY disappointing. Before this happened, I was seriously considering an Amazon Echo. Forget THAT.

  I have a generation 1 FireStick. I didn't use it much, it was so sluggish to move from menu to menu. Since I'm now working from home, I decided to monitor my surveillance cameras with the Firestick.  I have 5 1 megapixel cameras, and have 2 different programs I can use: tinyCam Monitor PRO and Onvifer Pro.I use these 2 interchangeably on my Note 8 with no troubles.  The cameras are on my lan, so the internet is out of the picture.The Firestick (gen 1) was not up to the task, video sometimes would freeze, it was never smooth, and was pretty much always pixelating on any motion or just crashing, so I decided to upgrade to the latest gen of Firestick.  This device is MUCH smoother moving between menus, and is a much more enjoyable experience than the earlier version. The surveillance camera software is much better, its usable for the most part, still some choppiness and alot of lag, so I was disappointed with that, and they only crash once or twice in 8 hours.  The device sits 4 feet from the wireless source, and its a 5g link, checking the connection reveals no connection problems, and can't be the source of the lag, so that points to hardware.  Plex seems to work better on this one better than the original one.  Overall, its an improvement over gen 1, and perhaps I don't use it as intended, since I don't use it for entertainment, but I expected better performance.

  I'm still unsure. I haven't used it long, and consistently enough to know, howeverI started running a similar problem with this ""lite"" model that I had with my other Fire stick.APPARENTLY, your power adapters are faulty, as each one of them has run into the same issue, they don't produce enough power to power the unit consistently, so it either drops the programming or it goes into the ""update"" or ""download"" mode repeatedly.Once I replaced the adapter with a better quality power adapter the units worked fine.Here's the rub, I'd like to use my adapters for their specific device, so I have to swap it out for the stick when I want to watch Prime or any other app.I checked on AMAZON for a replacement and you want $20 for one. That's insane as the stick only cost me $18. No wonder so many people have reported issues with them, THE ADAPTERS DONT FUNCTION PROPERLY & $20 for a replacement is just wrong?Where's your quality control & customer service?

  I have a very good surround system centered on a Denon AVR and multiple speakers.  All my surround sources go to the AVR which handles the surround audio and the video is sent to an LG OLED TV.  I want to be able to watch HBO Max movies in surround and initially bought a Chromecast which is supposed to be able to do surround but could not get it to work.  Saw many comments online having the same problems.  Spoke to their support but no joy.  Returned the Chromecast and bought this and it works PERFECTLY!!  I didn't want TV volume control as I have a universal remote to take care of that so this Fire Stick Lite is perfect.  The only down side is that the Fire Stick remote is not IR  so I cannot have my universal remote (which is IR only) control it.  But other than that it works very well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you want surround audio.

  This is my third Firestick.  I bought it because it was the latest generation and my first generation had trouble with a couple of apps - dropping video, and audio not synced with video.  This corrected that problem (so far) but now every so often I get no audio.  The only way to fix this is to unplug the power to the transmitter for a couple of minutes to allow it to reboot.  Then, so far, the audio will come back on.  Not sure if this is a problem with just my device or if it might be inherent to all devices.  Other than that it works OK.Since my last review:Got two separate phone calls from Amazon.  The first was to verify that I had connected the device properly and to try different router settings.  This did not help.  But I did find that if I turned off the TV and then turned it back on most to the time the audio would then work.  On the second call from Amazon, they asked for all of the info regarding model of TV, etc., as they had similar concerns from other customers.A couple of days later another annoying problem came up.  During the playing of a video on the You Tube app, the video suddenly froze.  Tried turning on/off the TV with no success.  Tried other apps and they worked OK.  Opened You Tube on a different Firestick and a different TV and it worked OK.  Went back to this one and it still froze up.  Finally removed the power and unplugged from the HDMI port, let sit for about a minute, reconnected to the TV and then the You Tube app started playing again.  This is getting very annoying.  Hope Amazon can come up with a solution soon.1/27/21 - Amazon replaced this item with a ""reconditioned firestick.""  Within 4-5 days it started exhibiting the same problems.  Evidently this item was probably returned for the same problems, then marked ""reconditioned"" and sent to me as a replacement.  I've have spent countless hours on the phone with Amazon service reps, along with countless hours reconfiguring and then having to drive 70 miles to a UPS store to return the previous item.  Looks like I will be going through the same hassle again.  If Amazon would have just replaced this item with a new item possibly out of a better batch, I wouldn't continue having this problem.

  This was not easy to set up. Ultimately I did not ditch my cable service like I thought I was going to. But I did downgrade it which saved me some money. We have multiple TV’s in the household, and it is to much of a drain on the internet to be watching at once. It was constantly buffering and it was annoying.Setting up: It took me almost 6 hours. It kept giving me error codes. I had to reach out to support multiple times to get it to work (also if you have to call support they charge you money). Thankfully I was able to sort this one out looking at their common problems. It was just frustrating.They don’t have long enough cords to plug into the wall. My second TV I still haven’t set up because I haven’t purchased extensions to use the Roku. They need to come with longer cords. My gaming devices has longer cords than this. Come on Roku.The voice recognition only works maybe 50% of the time. It is more frustrating than Siri. But when it does work I love this feature, it is something every cable/satellite service should have.I love all the TV channels and most of them are free. It is great. I down graded my TV package to the lowest level but I don’t feel I am missing out. There is so much to choose from. The application is basic, but I don’t mind if it has the channels I like. I love that it even has YouTube. Something Amazon fire doesn’t have.UPDATE: The life of the product doesn’t look hopeful. In less than two weeks my Roku has died. I am sending I back to Amazon for a refund. I am wondering if I should do the same with the other as well. For a $60 product you expect it to last. I’m hoping it was a fluke but this has me worried.

  I purchased this item about 18 months ago but didn't take it out of the box until two weeks ago.  I encountered problems in set up which, upon investigation, was not a unique event- it wouldn't finish set-up, got caught in a loop, etc.  I contacted customer support, admitting the ""old"" nature of the device.  It took 3 days for any response.  The first response told me to try some things which I did with no success and contacted them again.  2 days later they said it was out of warranty.  After a few back-and-forths they offered me a 30% discount on buying 2 devices.  That was fine but when I put in the discount codes it would only give me 15% on one device (and the 2nd device could have been bought for the same discounted price directly.  We are now 17 days into the process with their last non-automated response telling me the matter is settled.  Obviously it is not.  Maybe most of the devices are good but customer service is sadly lacking.

  I am old, old, old ""school"" and do not use the voice recognition feature.  I'm a button-kind-of-guy, but the fewer the better, and this one is just right, EXCEPT for a couple of features.  First, of course, you need a good quality (does not mean expensive) streaming TV and Internet.  Quality of ours (Roku) is pretty good.  The features I do NOT like are:The size of the remote/stick might be OK for a child's hand but it is difficult for man hands.  It is also super slick, like slide-out-of-my-hand slick.  Lastly from me, the volume control on the side is awkward to use, and there is an echo/feedback situation competing with our sound bar unless I put this remote on mute.  Even then, I or someone else sometimes inadvertently touch the up/down volume buttons and have to hit mute again if I notice the interference with the TV sound bar.  Functionally, the device works great (and there are a lot of programming choices), but the design of the handheld REALLY needs improvement.

  I have a Vizio M55-D0.The only port this device fits in is the Side HDMI as the shape of the TV back prevents a direct plug in. Using the side HDMI port I get HDCP error immediately upon playing any video, the menus work fine, but zero content will play.I overcame this by purchasing a 90"" elbow to plug this into the rear HDMI port (there is no flex connector or adapter in the package for compatibility issues fyi). Now most video plays... Strangely when I purchase explicit content (PPV, ESPN+ non-prime, non-netflix) I get HDCP errors that come up every few minutes show for a few seconds and then disappear - this pains me because I'm trying to enjoy purchased content, and usually hosting guests when doing so.Thought I could work through this will ROKU support. They send you instructions similar to the initial step 1 of calling the your internet provided in the early 2000s. Have you tried turning it off and on, then also unplugging and then plugging it back in again (to each HDMI port on the TV) - yup.Maybe I have older tech or something, but it plain doesn't work consistently for copyright issues, not necessarily the device not working - which is painful because it seems the device is nice, but the content cannot be delivered.2016 year model TV and 2018/19 Roku just won't play well together

  This is my third Roku, and it's the first one with a remote problem.  Presumably it's because it's now a stick instead of a box, so it's plugged into the back of my stereo receiver.  The remote was unreliable out of the box, and when I checked on the Roku website I was told to order a free ""extension cord"" for the Roku, to get it away from the HDMI ports.  That has only helped a bit. Every time I turn on the stereo and Roku, the remote is unworkable for a while.  I keep pushing buttons and then all of a sudden it's good.  But then later on it might stop working again.  I checked the batteries in case they sent me some that were nearly dead, but the meter says they are good.Why is Roku selling a device that supposedly has a long-distance RF remote when the RF signal apparently isn't strong enough to overcome interference?  The Fire TV stick plugged in next to it has no remote problems at all.  I may return this.

  The Roku SS+ was easy to pair to my TV and could power it on and off, and adjust the TV speaker volume. However, I was disappointed that I was not able to get the Roku remote to control my Sonos playbar which is hooked up to my LG TV via optical out. Prior to purchase I called Roku to make sure the remote could control my TV and Sonos. They told me that if my TV supported Consumer Electronics Control (CEC), I'd be fine. But they were wrong. My hours of googling suggested that If you use ARC over HDMI to connect your sound bar to your TV, Roku TV can use CEC to control the sound bar’s volume (maybe). But, if you're hooked up by optical out - you are going to have to buy a logitech smart hub to get one controller.But, all my gripes are about the remote and lack of control. As expected, the Roku device itself is great and the user interface is way better than my lame LG WbOS smart TV.

  I purchased this on May 2, and it was delivered on May 11.  As of yesterday, it is no longer eligible for return to Amazon.It was great when it worked, for all of 4 weeks, or approx 40 hours.  Then is start freezing up and none of the buttons on the remote would function at all.  I changed the batteries, but that made no difference.  The streaming stick is plugged into an electrical socket, not a USB port.  Freeze, reboot, freeze, repeat.Today, it does absolutely nothing.  No off/on function...completely dead.  This remote is as useless as the rest of this Roku Streaming Stick +.

  Same issue as many others apparently... out of the blue, six months in, nothing talks to the device anymore.  Runs red hot within only a couple minutes too.I'm honestly now convinced that Roku streaming devices, and their remotes, are too flimsy and janky to justify buying, and that the ""savvy consumer"" would be well advised to spring for something a little more sound.Had to replace the remote that came with it to see if that was the issue, and then of course had to return the replacement after that TOO failed to pair... at which point I walked into an amazing discussion with an Amazon rep trying to ""solve my issue"" by teaching me how to use the Roku app. as a remote instead  -___-  at which point it HAD been made clear that I was trying to return this thing for a refund after it out-of-the-box failed to function...So if you're following, the rep. was trying to prevent a refund for a defective item by teaching a customer how to use a different item instead.  Brilliant.After 30 min. the refund was agreed to WITHOUT requiring a USPS pick-up, which was odd, and when they agreed to the refund they also said something to the effect of ""because you're a valued customer..."", which was ALSO odd hahaha shouldn't it just be ""because that thing you bought no work..."" ?Ultimately it was fun watching AdultSwim on this cheap toy while it lasted, but now I'll probably have to purchase a more solid competing device and toss this thing altogether :(

  I have very high expectations for my audio/video gear. When streaming audio or video, I am used to using a home theater PC connected to my TV via a receiver. This is fantastic for most things, but it isn't very convenient or easy to use. Additionally and unfortunately, many streaming apps for Windows don't support the highest level of audio or video quality, which is very frustrating.To solve the convenience, ease of use, and quality problems, I purchased one of these. And the Roku Streaming Stick+ is very convenient (small, easy WiFi connectivity), easy to use (great interface), and allows me to stream high quality from apps like Netflix and Disney+.However, there are a few major problems with this piece of gear:1. Ads. I hate that there are ads littered about the Roku interface. Come on.2. No advanced features such as A/V sync offset. For some reason, audio in certain Roku apps is out of sync from the video. Neither my receiver nor my TV have options for modifying this sync - usually, I just change that setting per-application on my HTPC, and I'm happy. But there exists no such setting on Roku, which makes certain content unwatchable.3. The first copy of this piece of hardware I got from Amazon was dead on arrival and wouldn't turn on. I returned that Stick and purchased a replacement.

  After having Directv satellite for 18 years at my house (which I loved despite the breaks during storms), I called customer service because monthly price has gone from $92 to $163 in the past year, but they refused to discount any further so time to say goodbye to Directv.  After some research I decided on Youtube TV.  Next it was looking for a streaming device.  I am a channel surfer so quickness navigating between apps and programs to stream was of high importance.  I have an Asus RT-N66U router and Spectrum 100MB cable internet so bandwidth shouldn't limit me.  I first tried the streaming Stick + from Roku which gets glowing reviews.  I connected it via my 5G wireless (in the next room about 8' away from the TV) and it was very sluggish and reported a slow internet connection.  Doing a connection test in the ROKU reported 1Mb/s though the laptop on speedtest on the same wireless reported 54Mb/s.  I've had spotty coverage in the house with the 5G wireless so I switched to the slower and Roku was then happy with the porformance showing nearly what the laptop did.Pros - I like the Roku menus, DVR setup, layout, and the simple remote... Using a Panasonic Plasma 1080P, the picture is excellent with absolutely no complaints.  I didn't test anything with soundCons - What I don't like is the latency when switching among apps or when kicking off a stream.  Seems to buffer for about 8-10 seconds before the program starts playing.  I'm guessing this is buffering because if I compare what is streaming for a local channel to antenna input on the TV for the same channel, the Roku was about 8-10 seconds behind.  I have Youtube TV, Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix with the slowness the worst with Youtube TV.  I also don't like that you can't set a particular app to automatically run on startup.At less than one third the cost of Directv, I'll stick with it but it feels like going backwards in performance... like if you had to get rid of the SSD in your Core-I7 laptop for a slow hard drive.Note that I moved the streaming stick + to the bedroom TV and got a Roku Ultra for the main TV.  This time connected to ethernet and Roku reporting 78 Mb/s or better.  While the performance is slightly better, it still doesn't have the quickness I'd like.  I'll keep watching reviews for something better...

  I love Roku. I get a ton of free channels and pay channels like Disney, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, music channels and more. Even international TV channels. I bought Roku sticks for my sons and can share log- ins on some streaming services so they have access too, cutting down on costs.  The Roku channel itself has tons of great shows and movies. So easy to set up and I'm saving over $100/month vs. cable TV.  Should have done this years ago. I got it for my 80 year old mother. It took her a bit to get used too, but now she's flying through the streaming services like a pro. She's delighted with the expanded options and huge cost savings vs her previous cable bill. She has so many program choices, she has spent an hour just looking at what her options are. Never again will she say ""I have all these channels, but there's nothing interesting to watch"" like she did with traditional cable. Great investment, and you can take it anywhere.

  When you go to activate it fails and tells you to call a phone number. They then tell you you can't activate unless you have a registration code which costs 99.00.It is a scam do not pay to activate, try to activate on a computer not a phone.

  I've know for years that the Roku Stick was a superior product than the Amazon Stick but I already had an Amazon stick and figured how bad could it be?Well after frustratingly suffering through Amazon Stick for years, I had enough and purchase this Roku Stick. I should have done this month if not weeks after getting my Amazon Stick but I was too lazy and stubborn.I've only had it three days and it's never crashed. The Amazon Stick crashes or freezes on a daily basis.The Roku remote works perfectly and with my TV while the Amazon Stick remote never works, doesn't work with my TV, and their phone app remote is just as bad.The Roku wifi signal has never dropped while The Amazon Stick looses the wifi signal while it's sitting right next to the Router.This review will probably get deleted at some point for trashing an Amazon product but here you go.

  The concept is fine. The execution is horrid. It is all about the remote, not the stick. I found out, like others, that this remote design eats batteries about every 2 weeks depending on how much you use it. I finally put an ammeter on it and I found that the remote draws 30-150mA for about 45seconds after touching any button. If the remote is used on any reasonable frequency, that is far too much to be supplied by 2-AAA batteries.On the chance it was a defective remote, I got a replacement. Sorry, it is the design of the remote that is the problem. I will be returning the replacement also and getting a Roku with only an IR remote. It is really sad that Roku would hoist this ""long-range RF design"" without a warning. Most people expect 6-12 months life from remote batteries, not 2 weeks.

  The unit quit working after 6 months. Could not sync the remote to the stick. After troubleshooting with the tech by phone it was determined the unit was bad and an RMA warranty was issued.  The unit was returned by Express Mail and arrived within four days of the RMA being issued. Then a whole series of canned emails began, most ending with the question had this been resolved. I kept answer4ing no, not until a replacement unit was shipped. More canned emails. After about 10 days of this I was able to locate a customer service phone number (not on Roku’s website) and called them. I was told the status was they have the RMA, it takes about 10-14 days to ship a replacement depending on the warehouse but that I would b e getting a replacement soon. This seems to be ridiculous amount of time for a warranty replacement. A week later I get an email requesting a tracking number for the original return. Well I had been in temporary quarters for several weeks and had now  relocated and frankly did not store the USPS receipt safely as Roku said they had received the unit. Called Roku again and explained all of this to an agent who spoke poor English. Said he would do nothing without a tracking number. Asked to speak to someone who could resolve issue or to a supervisor. The agent just kept repeating without the tracking number he would do nothing and would not allow me to speak with anyone else. I finally gave up. I will now go with Amazon Fire-stick. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered in either my professional or consumer roles.

  Love it on my little Office TV. The TV is HD w HDMI port. But it is not a smart TV. I wanted to watch maybe my Prime or NF w/o commercials. I just cut the cord and tried a few antennas. But the $40 spent there was mostly a waste of $ on the little older TVs. I have no clue what is on the 20-40 channels I get in there. I only watch that TV after work during my treadmill or exer bike time. I’m thrilled w the pic quality. Plus I can watch so many old TV show if I want on many Roku channels w commercials. I immediately ordered a 2nd for my Bed/Liv smart TV. The Smart TV’s USB port is powerful enough to power the Roku. The office non-smart required the included USB extension and included wall plug. I ordered the HDMI extender that you can order from Roku for free. I don’t need it at home, but I plan to take it w me when I travel, because you don’t know what may be at your hotel, etc.  I like that the extender was offered for free w free 3 day shipping

  I bought this in 2/2018. Six months later the remote stopped working properly. I contacted customer support, and through troubleshooting, the problem was fixed. A while after the remote stopped working again. This time I was told to get an adapter to fix the problem, which did nothing. I contacted roku again today about this problem but because it’s been over a year they will no longer pay for a new remote. For paying $60, I am very disappointed with the quality and with the customer service. My device is no longer usable at this point and I refuse to pay for another remote when I did nothing to break it in the first place. Would not recommend this product to anyone.

  TLDR Buy an AppleTV.The first thing you notice after installing your new Roku is the large ad on the side of the screen – on the thing you paid for. It can not be turned off. I tried. Hard. Even if you never connect to a network, and the Roku won't do anything since there's no media player installed, the space will be used. You'll need to install a media player via yet another account on their website.So you go to the fugly website, disable some security so the login works, and jump through hoops to find something to sort of work. Oh look Netflix... hmm that doesn't look right... Sometimes the Roku can't hold a connection no matter what you do. Fine. Maybe tomorrow. I'll just shut it off... You can't. It keeps running 24/7. If you put in a USB stick or memory card adapter you'll discover it's constantly warm. The Roku never stops accessing it. What it's doing I have no idea, but it creeps me out.The Roku is pretty bad at everything it does. There's really very little the Roku can do that you can't do with a Raspberry Pi, if you're technically inclined. If it's too much trouble to do that, you can buy an AppleTV. Apple's heavy handed controls are only slightly less cumbersome than Android's privacy and security woes. Seriously, I've spent more time trying to get this thing to do what it's supposed to... that's why I'm on my machine today, again... at least the ads work...

  This is a great streaming device and the third Roku that I have so far (still using all 3 just fine) Let me start by first saying that there is a very popular highly trending negative rating from Nov 2018 here on Amazon warning people that if you try to add more than 2 Roku devices onto your account, Roku will insist on starting to charge you for a Premium account (or something.) This is false. The first photo I included here is my account showing all 3 of my Roku devices on my one account, zero charged, still free. So don't believe that review. The only thing i can think of is that maybe the author of the negative review got scammed and clicked on a spoofing/phishing website that tried to scam her out of money. Either way, rest easy, it's false, you don't get charged for having 3 devices and here's your proof. The second picture is my connection to the TV. I used the direct to TV method (powered by TV, not using electrical outlet.) You can see that the Roku itself is plugged in to the HDMI-3 port and the short black power wire is going into the USB port labeled ""USB (HDD 5V 1A)"" just above it. That's it. Easy-peasey. If you have a TV with connections that can support this set-up, it doesn't get much easier. It fired right up, linked right up to the Wi-Fi extender I already had right in the same room. Signal rating is ""excellent."" The third and final picture is the home screen after a few minutes of churning away adding/installing all the apps. All fired up and ready to go now. Very fast and robust navigation from app to app and using the apps. Way faster than my two older ones (Roku-3 from 2013, and Roku Express from 2017) I don't have a big body of work using the voice command remote. It's my first one, the older ones don't have that. I tried it once, I said something like ""Open Netflix app"" and it did just that, brought me right to the Netflix app and opened it. Pretty cool I guess. Granted it's only been a couple days but so far it's been great, as have the other two other Roku units in the house. Overall great deal. Very happy and would not hesitate to recommend it.

  Oct 10, 2020Like (what's better than the Amazon Fire stick):You can customize the home page (move things around)!You can remove apps you don't use!Freaking faster! It's not just faster...it's FASTER. Loads apps fast! Fast! FAST!My Samsung TV remote doesn't disconnect every other day because the Roku remote controls EVERYTHING.So far, it's only locked up once (thus the 4 stars) as the Fire stick needs to be rebooted (or power disconnected)  every other 5 days or so. (I have 5 Fire sticks and they all do that. My boss at work has a few also and he reports the same thing)What I don't like about it (compared to the Fire Stick):More expensive (about $20 more if the Fire Stick is on sale at $29).This review will be updated should anything change.

  Recently we got just sick and tired of paying $140 a month to be forced to watch endless commercials and ten-year-old reruns. I have been an Amazon Prime member and a real fan of the Fire TV Stick I've been using in addition to my cable service for years now, so when we decided to cut the cable bill and upgrade to a newer version of the Firestick we became interested in the ROKU Streaming Stick as well because we have heard a lot of great things about ROKU too. So I got one of each. I don't regret either. And I DONT miss the cable bill either!The ROKU streams beautifully, rarely ever an issue, EVER, with pausing to buffer; Loss of signal NEVER happens, and the picture is crisp and clear--actually as good as if not better than what I experienced with paid-for cable TV. My only real complaint is the sound: I have to crank-up the volume on my TV to get enough volume to understand what is going on.I enjoy the flexibility that ROKU offers in-that I can sign-on to Prime, HULU, or any channel available, including the ROKU Channel (Which I've come to enjoy immensely). I love that I have control to watch what I want, when I want it, without having to spend 40% of the time I've PAID for being force-fed ad after ad after ad,  ad-nauseum. On most free Channel Apps I find they only show two to four commercials per break, and there are fewer breaks making the advertising tolerable. I don't mind watching a few ads to compensate for watching TV for free. I just HATE watching endless commercials on a service that I'm paying for!I also like that you can purchase or rent movies right from your TV and that there are so many new releases available.Sure! The move to ROKU has taken some adjustment, but it's soooooo much better than cable TV! And I'm putting that 140 bucks a month I used to spend on cable TV to much better use.

  First off, I want to be clear that activation of the Roku device is free. Purchasing the device is the only money you pay to Roku. If you have somehow end up on a website claiming that you have to pay them an activation fee or an upgrade fee just to be able to use your Roku device then you have navigated to the wrong address and it is a scam. What you do have to pay for, if you choose to do so, is any of the paid subscription streaming services you want. Some services require a paid subscription and some don't. To name a few:  Watching basic YouTube (the same ones you watch for free on your phone, tablet, or computer), Tubi TV, Pluto TV, and hoopla (if available through your public library) are all free of charge. Netflix, Amazon Video, CBS All Access, YouTube TV, and Apple TV+ charge a monthly fee, but that has nothing to do with whether or not you use a Roku device to access their content.We bought a TCL Roku TV a couple years ago and, between Netflix and Prime, found that we weren't watching cable television anymore.  So we downgraded to internet-only service through our cable provider and got this stick for our bedroom TV.Unlike some of the less expensive Roku offerings, the remote that comes with this one does both TV power and volume, so as long as you're getting all your content through Roku (and never need to switch inputs to, say, cable/satellite/antenna service or a DVD player) you don't need to have a separate TV remote.  I was surprised the remote doesn't have a mute button, though.  Our TCL Roku TV's remote had such a button.  So if you're a heavy user of the mute button you may find that this does not in fact save you from needing a separate TV remote. I'm also a little troubled that our Roku TV, which we bought new only about two years ago, doesn't support Apple TV+. This particular streaming stick does support it. But it seems like a couple years is way too early for a streaming device to be even starting to creep into obsolescence. I have no interest in buying a new Roku stick every few years, and hope this isn't a sign of what's to come.It's also clear that the Roku stick has no idea whether the TV is on or off.  This means that if you just push the power button in the middle of watching something, it will keep playing--and perhaps even advance automatically to the next show.  This means you'll lose your place in a series and, perhaps more importantly, will consume more power and data.  So remember to stop playback when you turn off the TV.  Or get one of those power strips that automatically turns off accessories when the master device turns off. (Or buy a Roku TV instead of a separate TV and Roku stick--but remember my comment above about sliding into obscelescence.)If you're looking for free entertainment, there are some options but you probably won't find them up to par with paid cable TV or perhaps even with free over-the-air TV.  Tubi has some content, including a ""Not on Netflix"" section.  Pluto TV is okay--it has a lot of channels, but they're largely underwhelming.  There's a local news ""channel"" that in our case gives us content for the nearest big city, an hour away, rather than our actual local news stations.  The Roku Channel occasionally has a movie worth watching.  Your public library may offer some content through Hoopla as well. So there are some free options, but you're unlikely to be completely satisfied without some form of paid entertainment.

  I'm not buying any more Roku devices. Not after how things have gone with HBO Max and Twitch.The ONLY draw that Roku had was supporting ALL the apps i use slightly better than the built-in apps of my TV. And now theyre not doing that because in their greed theyre trying to double-dip by charging me a premium for the device AND the content providers for a piece of their action.  You dont need this.  Just use the apps on your TV.

  This roku streaming stick its nice, you'll stream in 4 if it's available from streaming services, the one little problem I encountered was that I was trying to power it with a different cable that did power it but I couldn't pair the remote, after switching to the included cable everything worked fine, so yeah use the cable included to power it it looks like it's designed that way to work the two together, other that that little issue everything works great, the one thing I didn't like was roku customer service you can't call anyone they send you to the website that is extremely useless and they take forever to reply any emails and that's why I rated this product 4 stars

  Overall this was a great upgrade from our Apple TV 3rd gen. We are only using for 1080p content at the moment.Super small & portable.If you're already a Roku user, the interface is identical, at least to my 2018 TCL TV. The remote automatically paired with the IR on my 2012 LG Plasma, which I didn't want at first, but this meant that it works also with my Vizio soundbar for volume control, so that works well too.One gripe: every time you power off the TV, the Roku must start up again each time you turn it back on. This sometimes takes 30 seconds to fully become functional. Maybe this is just me, but worth noting if you turn your TV on and off several times per day.Another thing to mention, especially if you're coming from an Apple TV: the interface for each app is different, so it takes some getting-used-to.

  I was going through the setup procedure and it came time to enter the code for activation. It said my account was BLOCKED and I had to call the number on the screen to get activation.  I called the number and they want a ""REGISTRATION FEE"" .....there was no activation fee .....It was a new policy by Roku put in effect in May. They wanted $80. I said this sounds like a scam and hung up.They had  information on my Roku account ...email, phone number, other Roku products that I had.I later got a text form Debbie the ""account manager"" who said if my Roku is still not working to answer ""yes"" to the text and she would get me the cheapest option, she sent the same text the following day. the numbers she called from were 914-334-6824 & 201-500-6506

  I have 3 televisions and 4 different Roku units. TV #1 is used the most and is 50' from the router. TV 2 is in a bedroom about 20' from the router. TV3 is in the computer room and only 5' from the router.  The Roku 1 was our first streaming adventure on TV 1 (50'down the hallway). Our first viewing experience was a success, although Roku 1 was slow and not a great experience. Roku 1 was replaced by Roku Premier. Premier was a huge step forward with no complaints on TV1.Next up was Roku Streaming Stick for TV #2 (20' from the router). No problems at all.Feeling good about myself, I put Roku 1 on TV3 in the computer room (5' from the router). Disaster! If another TV was on, it slowed to a crawl or even a dead stop. No more reprieves - --into the trash. I took Roku Premier from TV 1 and put it on TV 3, where it's performing admirably.I put the much touted Streaming Stick Plus (fabulous reviews right?) on TV 1 (50' from the router). When it works, it is fine, but it can't seem to work for more than a few hours. Then it will drop words, stop dead, the remote may stop working, picture may to fuzzy, etc. Usually these symptoms get worse rapidly. Seldom, it returns to proper programming. If I unplug the Roku device and then plug it back in,  it will usually perform well for quite awhile.Assuming the Streaming Stick Plus couldn't be at fault (remember those great reviews?) I though about replacing my aging router. But not being a total moron, I had been checking connections, signal strength, etc all during this process. According to WIFI analyzer, my signal at TV 1 is usually around minus 62-64, which is OK. Roku settings/network is consistently 'good'. My speed test results were generally 17-25 upload and 8-11 download, which is good 'nuff. So, unless I really am missing the boat, the router signal isn't to blame.Next step will be putting Streaming Stick Plus with it's great reviews on TV3 (5' from the router) and putting Roku Premier back on TV 1. Roku 1 will sadly stay in the trash where it truly belongs. Hopefully, life will go merrily on with three functioning TVs and three different Roku units. I really love Roku for what it does - - - when it works.

  This is my fourth Roku (the oldest one finally died after many (8?) years, and this one is an upgrade from a conventional 1080 Roku Stick).  Didn't have any of the problems with registration highlighted by another reviewer.  My old Roku Stick connected just fine through the streaming box HDMI input of my Onkyo 4K capable AV receiver to my old Sharp 1080 TV, but when I upgraded to a Samsung 4K TV,  the new TV didn't recognize the video signal from the old Roku Stick when it passed through the AV receiver.  (Note:  the old Stick worked fine connected directly to a HDMI port on the new TV).  Anyway, I decided to get a 4K Roku Stick+ to match the resolution of the new TV.  As a bonus, the Stick+ works fine passing the video signal through the AV receiver to the new TV.  Unfortunately, with this configuration, the Stick+ remote control does NOT control the TV power and volume (no surprise there), but I'm confident it would work if I connected the Stick+ directly to a HDMI port on the new TV.  However, in my set-up, the TV is wall-mounted so it's ""cleaner"" to use the AV receiver as the ""command center"" for all the HDMI video inputs by placing peripherals (AV receiver, blu-ray, boxes, etc.) on an adjacent shelf/table and use a single cable from the AV receiver to send the selected video signal to the TV.Bottom line, the Roku Stick+ provides an upgrade in video resolution to match my new TV, and also solves the problem of passing the Roku video signal through the AV receiver to the TV.  5 stars.

  In my experience, based on two different Roku models, the Ultra and this one the Streaming Stick +,  The Ultra is fine, no problems, but this one, Streaming Stick +, is a different experience. The problem is with the Remote Control. This Remote Control drain the batteries extremely fast, brand new they last a week with less than a week of use, it is unbelievable, and this happens with Duracell batteries.. DO NOT BUY this Stick

  The new presentation is very nice. Thing appear to move faster.However the move from the prior Fire TV was not as easy and seamless as it should have been. I neded to reload several apps and sign in again with ID and password... time consuming and unpleasant experience. Tune-in was not moved over and the new Tune-in app is bare bones and essentially useless.  So i brought back mu old Logitech internet radio to listen to my stations. too bad.AMAZON, you can do better !

  I have 3 of the Lite 2020 versions.  All 3 devices have issues with the sound.  Every time I turn on the TV and the Fire,I have to navigate to settings on the Fire Stick and restart for the sound to work.  It isn’t just the one TV happens on 3 different TV’s.  The 4K version does not have this issue.

  I love this fire stick.  Because the price was right, and what it comes with is unreal.  It has a remote control, Alexa she can talk back.  And it is so easy to set up. It takes you anywhere you want to go.  If Alexa can’t take you there she will tell you. And you can put it on six TVs love it.  I would buy this product again , but I don’t have too. Because I just told you it can go on six TVs anywhere you  cannot beat this.  Just get it you won’t be sorry.  It’s a keeper.

  I LOVE the amazon photos. Along with streaming my Disney, Netflix, You Tube. Photos are a great way to view family photos on the TV. I have setup for a screensaver to come on when I am not using the FireStick. I have uploaded almost 9000 pictures and we thoroughly enjoy the application.When friends and family come over we just sit back and discuss the memories. The Amazon Music that I enjoy on my phone is now playing in my home. Just press the Microphone button and say"" Play my Soundtrack"" , ""Play Van Halen"" and it does what I ask.We love it!

  I like being able to watch Netflix and other programming options (which I didn't realize I would have) by using this Fire Stick Lite.  The little remote control works OK, and allows for typing in the name of a program.  However, Alexa (which I did not realize I would have since I do not own a separate Alexa device) is a little fussy.  Sometimes the 'show' will begin but the voice activation issues such as no volume (in one instance) and / or no picture (in another) will occur.  So, I go back and manually plug in what I want to watch, where is works as intended.  I have yet to figure out how to use the volume control separately from my cable box remote.

  It works as well as all my previous Fire TV Sticks, but keeps dropping the audio. I have to reboot before using it every day, and sometimes more than once. I hope it goes away after the next update as it seems to have started after the new software version release came out this month. Fingers crossed. Great value for functionality though to get the most out of a Prime subscription.

  That's essentially my critique. I love the features and that I can play my music from Amazon on it. The bad side is, it freezes. The sound disappears and I have to unplug it and plug it back in like we do frozen computers. Seeing as the tv is on the wall with little wiggle room, it's a royal pain.I like that you can't see it (I'd been using an ancient Roku that no longer worked for anything but Pandora). I have to give it time to see if I'd buy it for my main TV.

  When my LG Smart TV became a non-SMART tv (known problem with LG TVs), I was contemplating on either getting it fixed or just buying another smart TV.  But then I saw the FireStick lite for $18, so I gave it a try.  It arrived the next day and I immediately hooked it up and downloaded apps...I got my ""smart"" TV back.  It works great on wifi.  Since my tv is located just on the other side of the wall where our router is, I don't need the adapter.  No buffering.  I like it so much that I bought another one for another TV.

  The Fire Stick Lite is the upgrade that I've been waiting for. I purchased the first generation Fire Stick when it came out and it worked wonderfully. But then it began to slow down response-wise so I knew it was time to step it up! But I can say the 1st Gen Fire Stick ran its course very well, and the Fire Stick Lite is that next level for streaming music, movies, and so much more. I couldn't be more happier with this upgrade. One of the best choices I've ever made.

  I love the Firestick and all of the smart features it added to a dumb TV. However, the only drawback is the Firestick disrupts my cable service everytime my wife watches it. So, that means every time she wants to switch back to cable, I have to reboot the system. I've recently been doing a fix I have found online, ""Fire Stick causes interference with my TV when viewing with an HD antennae. Only fix is to unplug Fire Stick from wall outlet."" In the end, I'm hoping for a permanent fix so that I can enjoy the Firestick without getting off the couch.

  At first I couldn't figure out how to use it but I called Samsung, and it plugs in the back of the tv and I then attached the 4 inch wire that came with it to the stick and plugged the other end in to the closest plug.  It works great.  I have no Idea how to use voice recognition or Alexa integration.  I am a retired Lady, and not very tech. I am happy with this new (to me) type of Roku and picture quality.

  This is the third Roku device that I've purchased, and it is considerably better than the two previous versions that were purchased years ago. Voice recognition works reasonably well. Easy setup. I find that I don't have to be as concerned about recording programs anymore, that I want to watch later, since all the network channels provide free streaming if those channels are included in your paid cable or satellite package.

  I replaced my old Roku Streaming Stick with this ""Plus"" model after upgrading my TV to a 4K projector. The interface is exactly the same, but is MUCH faster. Almost no lag loading apps, and menus are instantaneous. Voice recognition works well, and audio and video quality are great.My only complaint is with the 4:2:0  video compression detracting from subtle details like skin tones and skies. There is an option to use 4:2:2, but I think the real issue is that the streaming services are sending them in 4:2:0, so up-scaling them back to 4:2:2 does no good...in any case, I don't think I can blame Roku for this, and from normal viewing distances it's not really all that noticeable anyway...but on a 100+ inch screen, you don't have to get very close to notice it.

  I put a tv on our patio and was worried about running cable through the walls (brick). Such a fuss!  I read on all the different streaming devices and chose the Roku because it has an Xfinity app which is our cable provider. We can now sit on the patio and watch all of our channels and no wires through the wall!  Also, the Roku just plugs into the USB on the tv!  No need for a power supply but I’m glad it came with one and you didn’t have to pay extra for it!  I plan on getting another for our projector to have movie night in the back yard!I had trouble at first getting a solid connection to the internet. Signal would drop and movies would pause to buffer. I decided to upgrade my router. Wow!  Big difference!  It wasn’t the Roku at all!  The Nighthawk router cured that. Will also do my review on the Nighthawk too!The stream stick is larger than most but I had no problem using a different HDMI port. However, if you do have problems with plugging it up, they will send you an HDMI cable for free. So, either way, you’re covered.About the apps- yes, I bought the Roku because it has an app from my cable provider. Yet, that doesn’t mean that you can’t use it if you’re not with Xfinity. There are plenty other cable tv apps available!  Additionally, you can simply load the channel app that you want. I also enjoy the free tv apps like Pluto TV. Older movies but good ones and plenty to choose from!A built in web browser would make this unit complete!  Still won’t prevent a 5 star rating, though. I have used old desktops for years to connect to projectors and TV’s in my home and shop. The space savings is incredible - going from a desktop to a device the size of a USB jump drive!!  Not to mention the power savings!!We love it!

  I mostly got this for private listening. It works perfectly. That was the most important thing to me. The headphones I use pair well with my phone, so that part is where people would have problems. I really like that I can put apps that I only had in my tablet, some that didn't have casting ability on app, so now I can watch anything I want on the TV, and without disturbing sleeping people. There is also an option to level volume. So those super loud intros aren't so much louder than the show your watching. I haven't tried the voice search, since I usually only watch late at night and don't want to disturb people, so I can't comment on that. My TV supplies enough power to the stick even when off. If you look at the light and it's green it does, and if it's red it does not.

  We bought a new 4K smart TV.  You would think a plug in streaming device wouldn’t be necessary with a new smart TV.  But no... our operating system is based on android and they haven’t figured out how to play nicely with Apple, so we were forced into buying an add on streaming device.  We had a first generation Roku device which was just marginal.  This new Roku 4K streaming stick is a huge improvement.  Excellent 4K picture quality and HDR.  Easy set up and comes with a great remote.  I was shocked at how much content is  available.  Somewhere down the road I am sure we will cut ties with our cable provider.

  Plugged into HDMI input to my Samsung TV first, worked great. I'm only watching free shows, and signed up without a credit card on the Roku site. But it was a hassle to switch to the HDMI input to the TV, since I usually use my Marantz to watch DVD/Blu-Ray and my DVR for free Over-The-Air shows from my antenna. So I unplugged the HDMI from the TV, and plugged it into the HDMI input for Cable in the back of the Marantz. It has been working perfectly for several days now, and my remote lets me switch between them all. My only regret is losing the DVR functionality I have with my OTA reception - setting up recordings in advance, pause/play/skip capability, and having copies of things I recorded while I was doing other things.

  I have to reset my ROKU almost daily. Everything will be playing fine and then, without any warning,  the audio gurgles and echos.  I have to go into the settings for the ROKU and reset it. I also have issued with lip sync. I use the forward button for 2-3 frames and the lip sync is good. I tried this with the gurgling issue, but it does not help. in fact, no matter how far I go forward, when I reset the ROKU and restart my program it starts where the audio started actin up. Even if I have gone 10 minutes more into the show. Not happy. I am beyond the return window. so I have a $59 light paper weight. When I do rest the ROKU the screen says it does not have enough power even though it is plugged directly into the wall. When the ROKU does come back on the screen, it is dead. Just keep pressing the over button to get to the app you want. Eventually it will work. I guess I will have to try Amazon Fire and see if it is any better. I have been in contact with Roku and they say try these fixes. I have tried all the fixes except buying a new TV to see if it has issues on it. Their customer service is horrible.

  Already own another 2 of these devices, purchased this one to be a travel bag throw in so I can watch my streaming apps regardless of where I'm staying and not having to go through my phone or laptop to get to Netflix/Disney+/ESPN+/Hulu and what not.  These sticks are also great to replace the dated roku or Samsung smart apps built in on tvs that are no longer getting updates to apps.  Highly recommend this product.

  Not a good start.  The ""UP"" direction on the 4-way rocker switch was bad upon arrival so they're sending me an entirely new stick and remote.  I also noticed that when I came back to the device after a 12-hour idle period it just sat there on its screen saver and failed to respond no matter which button I pressed.  I guess it was deep in REM sleep.  Finally after about 1 minute of this nonsense it did start to work again.  I don't know if this is how it's supposed to work or not but I've never had these kind of problems with any of my four Amazon Fire TV sticks.  I'll try the replacement they send but I have a feeling I'll be returning it too and just getting another Fire TV stick.  Too bad!

  My girl set it up for are little one. Said it was supper easy and worked as should. We got a roku tcl tv so we are familiar with the interface. I have used vizio and Samsung smart tv and can say from experience roku has a far better set up and quality. Quality of the stream depends 100% on your internet and if any physical objects can interfere. Dont blame roku if your internet isn't good and you want to stream 4k. Thats your fault.

  This is now my 3rd roku, of all different generations. In short they all work very well and I'm a big fan of the new stick approach. One thing to note is that the product gives the option for a USB or outlet powered use. As the instructions indicate, a red light will illuminate and a notification will present on the screen if the USB does not have enough power. However, I find this is  also potentially a temporary problem as the TV starts up and starts feeding power to the device. After about a minute or so, this message disappears and the device works as normal. While your results may vary, if you are pressed to find an outlet and have a a little older Samsung lcd TV, in my experience it's only a minute or so, tops, before the TV is able to power the device. That said, it may function a bit better with even more power via an outlet, however I have had no issues yet.

  This has been super easy to use so far. Really simple plug and play, I even used the USB port on the back of my TV to power it and haven't had any issues yet (Samsung nu6900, if you're wondering). It detected 4k HDCP and hasn't given me any problems yet, but I've had it less than a day so I'll update if I come across any issues.The remote has a nice sturdy feel when you ""click"" the buttons, but I haven't used the voice option yet (and probably won't, tbh). I'm amazed at all the free content. My main reason for getting this was for HD streaming, but also because there's a Wow Presents Plus app. I was using my Chromecast to access that before, but the Chromecast is so moody and relies on my phone. It was always losing the wifi connection too. The Roku has a 2G and 5G wifi, which is exactly what my Spectrum router offers. I'm a convert so far.

  I had a little difficulty installing at 1st but I think it was me trying to rush installation.  It is plug and play but you need about 30 min to let everything upgrade, locate in install your wifi and such.  If you hurry it won't connect properly.  It took me two attempts but the 2nd time around I took a seat and let it do all it's installation without immediately jumping into the next step.  That time installed perfectly and when you hit the remote button TV turns right on connected to everything.  So love this thing just can be a little difficult to install

  These things are amazing. We have 4 primary TVs (and 3 in the kids bedrooms that they use w/ DVD players only), and 2 are really newer smart Roku-based Smart TV's...and even they are not as fast as these Roku Streaming+ Sticks. We upgraded two ""other"" larger TVs (in the guest room & upstairs living room) after completely switching to streaming TV (vs land line AT&T TV), and by god I could not be happier. Each unit was easy to install / supports virtually all streaming applications / is super fast / and the thing even automatically programs itself to control the volume & power of your TV (on the included Roku remote) *automatically*. Wow, is all I can say. Upgrade your old TVs, or even newer TVS (any TV older than one year with an HDMI port) with this thing. You won't regret it.

  Oh happy day ! ! ! !  Roku is awesome! I should of done this "" a week from last Tuesday."" I recently cancelled my cable TV as it wasn't worth the $100. bucks a month I was spending on it.  It was so disappointing , most everything offered I didn't want to watch anyway, besides I needed to cut expenses.  With Roku, ( a ONE TIME affordable cost,) the free channels and my Amazon Prime membership offer me everything I could want, and more!  Amazon Prime has some great movies and shows to watch , as good or better than Netflicks, HBO, etc.  There is no downside to this, as long as you have a good wireless internet you are good to go! Added plus- it is easy-peasy to set up.

  Please note there is a scam that will redirect you to a site that will charge you to connect your Roku box.  Please ensure you entered the exact URL you see on your screen when you are setting up the box.  ROKU will NOT charge you to setup the box.This streaming stick is incredible.  you can rid yourself of multiple remotes and just have one remote that operates our TV and streaming.The buttons that take you straight to SLING and net flicks are very nice.The rage of this remote is incredible.  I can adjust my TV  from across the house.Overall its a great buy

  I bought 2 different Roku devices for my family when we discontinued our cable. This one, for about $50 which we use in our family room, and the “express” version for $25.00 for the bedroom. The less expensive one in the bedroom work fine, no problems. THIS version however doesn’t.  The audio doesn’t line up with the video, so you’ve got a news reporter movining their lips, with their words lagging a couple sentences behind.  The only way to “fix” it is to turn off the tv, then  unplug the Roku for a few minutes.So, if im really trying to listen to something that I’m interested in, I either have to deal with looking at the video without the audio lining up, OR stop everything for abou 5 minutes to reboot. This started happening about a week ago and I know the problem is with this unit, because my son streams the same channels in his room, and I stream the same channels in my room, using different streaming devices with no issues.I hope it’s not too late to return this.

  The thing I enjoy most about the firestick is the ability to get almost any streaming app I desire. Dish Anywhere app is available on Amazon firestick. For any of you that have Dish Network as your television provider, you can stream from your hopper, live tv, your recordings, and even on demand right to your phone, tablets, or Amazon firestick. When ever I travel I always bring mine with me and plug it into my hotel tv. I then have the ability to watch the programming I subscribe to and I can also stream Amazon Prime, Netflix, and many others. Amazon has been able to make my viewing and streaming needs far more accessible and hassle free.

   I got my first fire stick in November and it worked for a while. Then it started logging me off my apps or programs. Sometimes it would buffer forever. I would plug it, unplug it, restart it, update it and so on... sometimes it would let me hear the sound of a show but show either no image or a frozen image. I called customer service and they told me to return it with all the pieces except with the controller so I did. I got my “new” later than expected, without a power cord or extension cord. I tried it with another cord I have at home and it won’t start... I wish I could get my money back...

  The device itself is a decent replacement for cost/cable cutting, but the Fire software could use work.Built in Web DVR works but doesn't always record scheduled shows and requires you to delete old watched programs and movies twice in order to fully get rid of them on your screen.UI is clumsy, finding shows and movies is awkward, (unless you use Alexa) and frankly just an overly-complicated mess.Most importantly; We frequently have to reset (Power Cycle) the device due to a black screen.No KTLA, no Comedy Central, and a few others, but nothing that would prevent me from buying it again....

  I use this for video streaming and music. I previously used a DVD player, but it frequently would have to be powered down to reset it before being able to continue using for streaming. The firestick has been continuously reliable with excellent performance.

  The fire tv lite overall looks great if you using a 1080P TV if you have a higher resolution than that you should go for the 4k version. The control of the fire tv lite feels cheap but it does the job, you probaly have to be carefull with kids using the remote control they might brake it do to how light it is.

  This version of fire TV is more affordable than the 4K. We have both at home and I like both but the volume and power TV control buttons on the 4K version are helpful. I didn’t notice much difference in picture quality though for streaming.

  I really don’t like the new menus. I’ve had several Fire TVs and sticks A d the menu is too difficult to navigate with the newer smaller home widgets. It’s difficult to know if you’re on a main home widget or on something else like an add for a non Amazon product.

  I am glad I upgraded my firestick. My old one was glitchy and starting to get very annoying. The new one gave me new options and more channels (of all things). I am really enjoying the speed and the many options of finding things to watch.

  For under $20 Amazon fire stick lite IMHO is best streaming device i ever owned and here is why.  #1. Price can't be beat.  #2.  So simple to activate that even i had no trouble.  #3.  Alexa voice recognition actually works unlike the Roku's that i previously owned which were more than double the price.  #4.  Simple control buttons and ease of use. I am so happy i tried the fire stick  lite. I highly recommend it , low price, high quality.

  After an hour long call with tech support, it was determined that my fire stick was non functioning. Got a credit and had to purchase a new one. I do not have Alexa and Amazon does not make a Firestick without that capability. That stinks.

  Yippee! Now my parents are able to watch things like Netflix, Disney +, and other things. They are NOT tech savvy but I installed it and showed them a few times and they are pros. It also takes an old TV and makes it able to do the stuff a new one can with a much cheaper price tag. Great product.

  I didn’t know what I bought honestly. My home entertainment system was run by Google and I wanted to try Alexa Firestick. It was on sale and I went ahead and bought it.I didn’t like that I cant control the TV volume with it and there is no volume control in the remote as well. It’s a big deal.It was my fault I didn’t read the description well though and for $18 you cant go wrong. I can live with it.

  Before I used fire TV stick I used a cable to stretch across the room to my computer.  A pain to hook up and put away. Plus a hazard for someone walking through the living room.Now I just change the TV input and bring up the programs I've subscribed to.  Very ease.

  This was a good product at first but it has been terrible for the last 4-6 weeks, very much making me regret spending the $50  on this and not on the fire stick (which i already have one and just bought a second one because this has been a piece of crap lately). It is always giving issues saying it can't connect to the internet, then I got to settings, check it and there is an excellent connection. Also stops playing in the middle of shows so I have to get up and unplug it then plug it back in to get it to work, which it only does for a short time then I have to do that again.Just buy the Amazon Fire stick and save yourself some time.I'd also like to say that I did my research before buying this and thought it was the better buy for certain features, but not worth it when the other stick does everything exactly the same.

  Product does not work well. The app for the remote operation does not work correctly either. The customer service is poor. The system tries to force you to put in your credit card information, when it should be just allowing you to setup your account. After a month or so the tech support will let you know that you don't need it. Most things require another account to access.

  i like to think that the mu-mimo wifi on these is why ive had 0 issues streaming 3 of them at the same time. the roku remote app for the phone appears to compensate for signal delay, making quiet/private listening a breeze. (sometimes glitches but updates seem go have cleared that up more recently). ive even listened through airpods while my phone is charging without issue. menu is responsive enough and the included remote doesnt need line of sight :-).todo: setup with an hdmi audio splitter to bookshelf speakers via mini amp, plugged into a dell ultrasharp monitor via displayport conversion

  the devise is easy to install. the remote is a nightmare to get it to work. The signal doesn't get to the tv so I spent too much time pressing the channels really hard and it still doesn't get the signal well. The app works but it has commercials and you have to look at it as you change. Is not like the physical remote that you feel the buttons and don't have to look down to change the tv. do something with the remote, otherwise it could be good.UPDATE: 10/1/2019 I called Amazon they comunícate it with Roku  and they will be sending a new remote.

  my first roku since the first-gen ""box"" way back when, which i ditched when i switched to a smart tv.  however, the smart tv in question (an LG) keeps phasing out support for the apps i use, and the interfaces are abysmal.bought this for xmas and haven't looked back.  UI is straightforward and intuitive.  has apps for everything i stream - amazon, netflix, cbs, cw, etc etc etc.  setup couldn't be simpler - plug it in, connect it to wireless.  only downside: no way to assign a static IP address, so if you generally do that (or if your router is twitchy about dynamic assignments) you're SOL.solid A.  would buy again.

I am sold on this product!  I am ordering another one for the TV in my bedroom...

  Love Roku.  This device works great and can't believe for it's size what it can do.  For those looking for a mute button beware that the exact model number has not changed between the one shipped with a mute button and one shipped without the button.  Mine ordered on November 24,2019 was shipped without a mute button.  The item was clearly advertised with a mute button.  Now to be fair Amazon support did provide a resolution for my trouble.  So be prepared to possible receive the wrong item as presumably they clear out old inventory.

  The stick works.  It performs as promised, but it will not work until you provide your credit card number first.  After you do that, the upsell requests begin for you to add premium channels...free trials, etc.  Roku asks for demographic information that has nothing to do with the function of the device.  I have no problem with the function of the Roku stick, but its backdoor marketing efforts left me wanting to take it out of the tv and send it back.

  I purchased this and it worked great for a couple of weeks. Then all of a sudden it would not work anymore. I exhausted all options. I checked my WiFi and it was good. My internet worked good. Everything was fine. It just stopped working. It was definitely a waste of money. I know these things don't last 10 years, but I figured it would have lasted a lot longer than 2 weeks.

  This was a faster stick than my others. (I have 8) Then they updated the menu system. Small Icons and menu system in the middle of screen! Not at top. I don't know who thought it out but it's bad enough that I took the new Lite Stick out of service and put the old one back in service. C'mon Amazon. At Least give us a choice on the menu to go back to the menu it came with! New GUI is confusing.

  This has been a great purchase. I don’t know why I waited so long. It works a lot faster than the apps on my “smart TV”.

  This device ran at a temperature of 120 degrees when plugged into my TV's HDMI port, whether powered by USB or wall outlet. Too hot to touch and too hot for nearby TV components. I contacted ROKU and they sent me a replacement device but that one did the same thing.  I tried to call customer service and was told there would be a 12 minute wait.  20 minutes later the recording said the wait was 17 minutes so I hung up.  Very disappointing.  ROKU seems to be going downhill despite their excellent product reputation.  Stay away from this particular product if a running temperature of 120 degrees in your HDMI port scares you.

  This streaming stick is the best yet from Roku. 4K and fast response from a stick format is a definite leap ahead. This is the first Roku stick format that doesn't feel like a compromise. Powers fine off the USB port on the back of my TV - just takes several seconds to boot up when I turn the TV on. I also really like that there is now TV power and volume right on the remote. I have the TV mounted on the wall with an extremely thin cord track that runs down with only the power cord. Made for a very easy and clean looking install. Roku has an extremely extensive channel lineup. I just wish they would update their interface. Voice search and app launch also works well. Highly recommended!

There's an app you can download from Roku on your ios devices which you can control like the controller but from your phone.Would recommend anyone to purchase this.

The remote will not pair with the device and it turns out that's because the device (although it says it's connected) is not connected to anything and will not connect. I just saw other reviews stating that the roku plus just stops working or there is a $70 upgrade needed, which is completely ludicrous. No wonder the product is no longer available. I have roku's on all of my TVs but i will never purchase another and will warn others not to purchase as well.

  I really like my Roku. I had one about 10 years ago and loved it. A few years ago my daughters bought me a smart 4K tv and I gave my Roku to a friend (they love it, got rid of their Dish satellite). I had lots of problems with the smart tv apps and decided to go back to Roku. Glad I did. Love the 4K content. Still have Dish because I live in remote area and could not get local programs via antenna.

  This is my 4th Roku and it only lasted a couple of weeks my 3rd Rouku lasted 6 moths. I returned the last one for a Fire Stick which is more reliable as I have had one in the past.  I will no longer buy Roku even though I like the software layout better.

  Bought it for my daughter who was coming for an extended stay!  While she was home we learned how to use all the features.  It is a very nice product for the money. We did have several freezes with the stick but after restarting, good as new.  My daughter bought her own Roku to take with her when she left

  Roku is very easy to use.  I also have Firesticks on other TVs and did not have good luck on this particular TV. Not sure why, it is an LG and I was always having trouble with the Firestick freezing.  I have not had this trouble with the ROKU. It has been very good with all aspects of streaming.

  I've bought 3 and the set up was fast and easy. The remote works great on this model for TV and sound bar volume. Connects TV to my Tablo HD antenna DVR. Now I just pay for internet and a small fee for some streaming services. No more cable TV for me. My Tablo fills in my needs for local channels and about 30 more. Very happy with the Roku.

  This works great streaming from different services.  I wish it had a free web browsing app but it doesn't.  The voice recognition doesn't work with my masculine manly deep voice lol, so if it messes up, I use a higher pitched tone and it usually figures it out.  My wife thinks it is funny when I resort to that though.

  This is our second one of this model, and third ROKU stick. Could not be happier. They just work. We have a sound bar on the main TV so we use the older 3600R unit for that as controlling the TV and the soundbar via the Roku remote is not really possible. No big deal. But the other 2 TVs, we only ever use the Roku remote now for everything. Highly recommended.

  I have the cheap one and the expensive one. I accidentally bought the cheap one thinking I was buying the expensive one. The downside is that it does not turn the tv off and volume up and down on the cheap one. I think the firestick is one of the only ones that streams slingTV a big plus. Stream quality is better then roku in my opinion.

  After several phone calls with tech support for router and Roku + device which ruled out router, and modem roku device became the only device in my wifi network with slow connection speed. This results in random pixelation and buffering. WiFi network is based on a brand new robust mesh system that is providing solid 230Mbps download to two phones and two computers and confirmed. Roku tech support was polite but amazingly inept even with a senior advisor requested. I am very disappointed. Recommend staying away from Ruku devices.

  I've owned my Roku Stick+ for a little less than a year (bought in October 2018).The Roku appears to enjoy randomly factory resetting itself, requiring me to go through the entire Roku reconfiguration, re-logging into accounts, reconnecting subscriptions to the Roku device, etc. etc.Overall, not an enjoyable experience. Would prefer a more stable system. Would not recommend this product to friends or family.

  Amazing streaming device!! I have the fire stick in my bedroom set up on wifi and always had problem with my direct tv now service constantly buffering, i ran speed test on my fire stick and found that I was only getting 5mbps through my wifi (none of my other devices have this issue). I bought this Roku because it had the external wifi set up and my issue has been solved. This new remote rocks too, i can turn my tv on and off and adjust the volume now. couldn't do that with the fire stick so i always had to keep 2 remotes handy. I looked into apple tv and nvidia shield as well and those are awesome too but for the price point and just using it in my room, I feel like this is the best value.

  So here is the deal. I already have a Roku Streaming Stick 3600R (2016 version) in our family room. We liked it so much that we wanted our kids to have it for their play area TV, which was closer to the router. Since the family room now needed a new streaming device, I decided to go with the next logical step, the Roku Streaming Stick+ 3810.I am not new to the Roku experience and interface. It was still very snappy. The great content apps were still there. It's basically waiting for me to do a TV upgrade to 4K, which I don't know when it's going to happen. :)I also did discover that I can actually turn on/off the power to my Sony sound bar and also control its volume using only the Roku remote. This makes it very convenient.To feel good about this upgrade, I decided to do several tests related to the temperature, Wi-Fi signal (both using Roku secret menus) and then a speed test using Netflix. I know the Netflix test is not a pure speed test because it uses the Netflix servers, but it's an acceptable indicator for me.Please keep in mind that this is not a scientific test. It's more of a test to check for systematic changes between the two Rokus given other fixed factors. I did all testing within the span of 1-2 hours so I hope no major changes were introduced that affected the tests.Test Configuration (things that did not change during testing): - I did *not* change any advanced default settings in the Roku devices (e.g. interference mitigation, power, etc.) - For audio/video, Roku devices were connected via HDMI to a Sony sound bar HT-CT380, *not* directly into the TV. Both the sound bar and TV support only 1080p, not 4K. - For power, Roku devices were connected to Dish Network Hopper 3 receiver's USB port, which is nice because it is on all the time, whether Hopper is powered on or in standby. - For Wi-Fi, Roku devices were connected wirelessly to a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 (with custom Tomato Shibby firmware) which supports both bands: 2.4 and 5.0 GHz.Test Results*** Roku Streaming Stick (3600) ***Temperature: 74 C2.4 GHz Signal strength: 252.4 GHz Antenna 1: 292.4 GHz Antenna 2: 32Glitch/sec: 385.0 GHz Signal strength: 195.0 GHz Antenna 1: 175.0 GHz Antenna 2: 19Glitch/sec: 32.4 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 14.87 Mbps5.0 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 15.63 Mbps*** Roku Streaming Stick+ (3810) ***Temperature: 97 C2.4 GHz Signal strength: 212.4 GHz Antenna 1: 322.4 GHz Antenna 2: 34Glitch/sec: 1775.0 GHz Signal strength: 285.0 GHz Antenna 1: 345.0 GHz Antenna 2: 32Glitch/sec: 02.4 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 35.58 Mbps5.0 GHz Netflix Connection Speed: 75.13 MbpsConclusions: - Roku 3810 runs about ~30% hotter than the Roku 3600. I hope it's still within acceptable range. I did not receive any warnings or anything during use. - With Roku 3810, 2.4 GHz overall Signal Strength decreased by ~16% compared to Roku 3600. - With Roku 3810, 5.0 GHz overall Signal Strength improved by ~47% compared to Roku 3600. - With Roku 3810, 2.4 Ghz Netflix connection speed improved by an impressive ~139% compared to Roku 3600. - With Roku 3810, 5.0 Ghz Netflix connection speed improved by an incredible ~380% compared to Roku 3600.Comments: - I noticed in one of the tests that the while the Antennas (1 and 2) signal strengths were higher, the overall Signal Strength was lower. Perhaps the overall Signal Strength takes into account other factors such as  glitch/sec, interference, etc.? I am not really sure. - Even though 2.4 GHz signal was poorer with the new Roku, I still got faster speeds with Netflix. This tells me that not only the antennas are different, but perhaps the Wi-Fi chipset is improved or something. - In general, using 2.4 GHz band produced way more glitches per second compared to 5.0 GHz, so in my situation, I recommend/prefer using the 5.0 GHz band, especially considering the speed test results in Netflix.Overall, I feel happy about the experience.

  This runs extremely well. I've added just about each of the Roku device generations in my home, and I have one quip to make.  Roku, add Alexa app support.  I know it is competition, but supporting your competition only brings in your competitions market support.  Your sealing a real deal. As for this Stick+, I love it.

  I used an Apple TV for years but randomly bought a TV with the Roku system built in. That pretty much sold me on Roku going forward. Way less expensive and far easier to conceal than ATV.We’ve also had a Fire TV stick and this Roku is superior to that as well.If Roku ever managed to get iTunes (probably never )it would be basically perfect.

  This didn't work with my 4k Vizio TV initially. It only detected 1080p during setup, and It gave me the purple HDCP error when trying to stream anything and everything. I bought a cheap 3ft HDMI extender that supports HDCP 2.2 for $5.95; plugged it into my HDMI 1/ ARC port; did the video auto-detectand on the roku setup again, where it detected 4k and HDCP successfully; and now it streams video just fine....

  Roku is the easiest in terms of set up and features. I like how this streaming stick can control the power and volume on the TV, literally the only remote I need. The Roku in my opinion is the best since it’s platform agnostic and you don’t have to choose Apple, Google or Amazon!

  Love it! Great for streaming directtvnow. Ordered three and also have a roku tv. Easy user intuitive interface. Easy to understand why a Roku owns the market.

Fire stick remote doesn’t control sound, Apple TV 4+ touch pad is too sensitive I’m inadvertently  changing channels.

  I like how little to no space this thing takes up. It does take a little while for me to have control once it’s on.

  This is the best streaming device I've ever owned.

  Truly the perfect product for streaming apps at home. Instructions state  for best quality to have the power going from a wall outlet instead of the tv. I was a little concerned but I went ahead and use the tv as the power source and the quality is great still and no issues.

  Got this for my mom so she could stream Sling and Hulu instead of using cable.

  I have never owned a Roku before and always used my Wii for Netflix.  I love this for several reasons.  It plugs into the back of the tv so I don't have an additional box to contend with and it is so easy to use.  Now I can use not only Netflix but a number of other free channels for movies etc. and if I choose some to purchase.  It was easy to install and configure and that is saying a lot for someone that is technically challenged.  I am considering purchasing another one for my bedroom as well.

  I am old school, so I don't have a smart tv. I purchased this after I gave up satellite tv, and it works great. Turned my old tv into a smart tv in a matter of seconds. The apps are basically endless, and it is easy to navigate.

  It works great! Very smooth. I've owned two of the previous versions of the fire stick and this one definitely works better.. I have it in a dorm, where I share wifi with tons of people, and I never have any lag or anything. Plus this one is cheaper than the previous models!

  Excellent product. I have not been disappointed. Voice recognition system makes searching for movies or programs a cinch. Online reviews by Tech experts pointed me to this Roku Streaming Stick + and their reviews were spot on.

  The problem was that it continually lost its internet connection. It was connected wirelessly, the router less than 5 feet from the Roku stick, with over 400 mbps download speed. I kept getting messages about low bandwidth and that the router was too far from the Roku. Eventually it wouldn't connect at all. That's when I had enough and returned it.

  Little clunky with the apps, now Hulu does not even work.  Called Hulu, they will only reset my password which so far has not helped.  Other apps work, I may have to cancel my Hulu soon.Update, finally Hulu working.  I have a suspicion it was Hulu not Roku.

  BS Chinese product, does not come with the extension you need to attach to most any TV as the stick is too long . 25 cent item I then have to pay 6.00 for on amazon. ROKU says y oh u can get it fro free but the on look une form does not work.

  Hate it that it dosent allow you to use vudu. It only let's you use movies anywhere which only takes half the movies you have saved on vudu.I won't be buying a fire stick again till they let you download what ever app you want on it.

  The reason for purchase was for app to run on two tv’s. Purchased app for already owned fire stick. Purchased this fire stick to watch this app on second tv. Well the app is not compatible with this fire stick. So this fire stick is useless!
