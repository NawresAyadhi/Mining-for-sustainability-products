review=["I have many fire sticks. As well as an original Fire TV, and 2nd gen Fire TV Cube. All work great. First gen sticks are really slow now though; don t use them really anymore (sometimes bring them while traveling to use with hotel TV s). I bought this new lite version because I have a portable projector that I use with fire sticks. I usually used the old gen 1 fire stick, which again, was slow. This new firestick is super fast (equal to the Firestick 4k) and works great with my projector. While using the projector I have no TV or Volume to control with a remote; so, I didn t need those functions. My projector also only puts out 720. So again, no need for the 4k. If you want a Firestick that will last the longest, and provide the best picture, get the 4k stick. But, for some people, like for my uses, this lite version fits my needs perfectly", "Oh my...I shouldn t have waited so long to purchase.I wasn t sure if I needed it but now I don t know what I would do without it.It was super easy to connect to my TV and setup.It plugged right in and then I was ready to watch my shows in under 10 minutes!","Works like a charm! Setup was a breeze. Be patient while it checks for updates. Got Prime video, Netflix, Hulu all up and running.", "Have purchased several Fire TV sticks in past. Just purchased this new lite version of it for an additional television of mine. Works just as well as any other version of the Fire TV Stick. Super easy to set up and get started with it. Highly recommended","I admit that the thought of cutting off cable caused me actual emotion pain lol. But so did paying that cable bill. The Amazon firestick delivers everything I need for TV viewing. I am not missing cable at all! I am so happy that this technology is available and delivers television viewing in a remarkably easy and painless way at such an affordable cost. Now... what to do with that $120 extra per month... :) I m a happy girl!","THIS IS ALL CAPS SO YOU READ IT BEFORE BUYING!!!I HAVE THE NON LITE VERSION BUT MY DAUGHTER AND SON N LAW WANTED A FIRE STICK SO WHEN THIS WENT ON SALE THIS WEEK I BOUGHT IT..WITH THE THOUGHT TO MAKE IT A XMAS STOCKING STUFFER. I DIDNT KNOW IF ANY DIFF. WERE PARAMOUNT IN THE LITE VS THE FULL STICK BUT THOUGHT TO TAKE A CHANCE ANYWAY.THEY HAVE HAD PROGRAMMING LAG ISSUES FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. THEY HV THEM ON EVERY CHANNEL ALL APP INCLUSIONS AND WITH A 3 YR OLD IT WAS FRUSTRATING FOR THEM...IN A BID TO SEE IF THIS STICK NIGHT HELP..I ASKED IF THEY WANTED 1 OF THE GIFTS...THE STICK...EARLY.THEY SAID YES...I MET HER TODAY TO SWAP THE STICK TO HER...SHE GOT HOME..HUBBY INSTALLED IT AND NOW NO LAG. NO PAUSE NO INTERRUPTION IN PROG. THIS IS AMAZING..GET IT..GET 1 FOR EACH TV. AMAZON RULES!!! This did what extra bandwidth didnt. Smooth prog. hack for old smart tvs. It makes up for tv wifi antenna issues... Better reception.","We were previously using a game console to stream video content to our TV. This was fine for the gamers in the house (me) but everyone else struggled with using the controls to watch streaming programs. I picked up the Fire TV Stick Lite and was amazed and how easy it was to to setup. Installing apps for streaming was like you would do on a phone or tablet and the remote is simple to use. My daughter really likes the built in Alexa to the remote. With this we are getting much better use of our streaming services. We have even figured out how to get HBO Max on it so there is no need to go back to the game console for anything other than games.","There is no volume but we bought the universal remote that the fire stick lite attaches to the back of for my parents. It was a WIN WIN!! They are tech challenged to the Nth degree and it was the best combination we could find. It created one remote. The universal remote controls the tv volume, input for devices, their hdtv antenna, and then they flip it over for the fire stick lite. It was the best combination we could find! The universal is made by Phillips and the fire stick attaches to the back. You have to try it if you need volume control and access to multiple devices.","Good product. If stick doesn t power up tap the home button.","First of all, this is the lite.. But let s get real here. Do we actually need seperate buttons for Netflix, Disney or Hulu just to pay more? No. The lite does not have those extra buttons but who cares. It still has Alexa voice and super easy to use. 1. It s heavy duty remote yet small. Definitely can with stand a fall but the gorgeous sleek design is perfection. 2. No it doesn t have the Netflix button, or a volume button. But since my volume stays at one level all the time that does not bother me at all. Plus I really don t care about 4 extra buttons to press for Netflix, Hulu etc. When I can just tell the remote to open the app for me 3. It has games to play with your family for free too. Really fun games especially in the covid times when we re all together so much of the time. 4. Picture and volume are beautiful on my TV. They fit the screen perfectly 5. There are tons of actual FREE apps for movies, TV shows, live TV and more. And yes ALL FREE NEVER CHARGE. Plain and simple this is the best alternative to cable ever. I m saving 150 dollars a month just using the fire stick. Yes I have a netflixs account and Disney plus I pay for. But I have everything else absolutely FREE. This will NOT DISAPPOINT anyone. Set up is super easy and fast, just plug and play.","This FS Lite is amazing! As fast as a 4K stick! The rom expansion is 10x easier, no annoying ADB Shell to deal with, just plug-n-play the hardware and within 1 minute it formats and is done. Alexa is functional. The 1080 streams are crisp and clear. You will never find a better streamer for under $30. I run a Shield Pro and Tivo 4K, and will keep this FS Lite in the arsenal. I have nothing negative to say about it. Good job Amazon!",
"I wanted to write a review to outline how/what we used this for. We have a older Vizio flat screen TV in a workout room. We wanted to bring up the Peloton app to access workouts on the TV rather than streaming them on an iPad. This device gave us exactly what we needed. While I can access Prime Video, Netflix, etc, we were able to pull up Peloton and it works like a charm. If you are looking for a simple streaming device for a good price, this works great.","I have a very good surround system centered on a Denon AVR and multiple speakers. All my surround sources go to the AVR which handles the surround audio and the video is sent to an LG OLED TV. I want to be able to watch HBO Max movies in surround and initially bought a Chromecast which is supposed to be able to do surround but could not get it to work. Saw many comments online having the same problems. Spoke to their support but no joy. Returned the Chromecast and bought this and it works PERFECTLY!! I didn t want TV volume control as I have a universal remote to take care of that so this Fire Stick Lite is perfect. The only down side is that the Fire Stick remote is not IR so I cannot have my universal remote (which is IR only) control it. But other than that it works very well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you want surround audio.","This review is for the Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote. I have 2 Roku 3s and have used them happily for years but their one downfall is that I can t stream facebook video with them. On black Friday this year, this product was on sale for 19.99. I figured at that price, why not give it a try? Lots of local musicians have been posting live video to facebook during the pandemic and I have been confined to watching them on my desktop - until now! The user interface for the Fire is intuitive and easy to use. It fired right up when I plugged it into my flat screen and as a welcome surprise, a lot of the apps I already had installed on my Kindle Fire tablet installed by default on the tv stick. Very slick! I opened Facebook on my phone, found a video, and was able to cast it to the Fire TV stick very easily. I did have to install the Facebook Watch app, but once installed, it made it even easier to watch videos from that platform. It also worked seamlessly with my Plex server (a must-have feature) and all the standard streaming services like Amazon video, Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube. I would recommend this as your central streaming device for sure!",
"Installed it almost as soon as I got it, turned it on had to do upda]te and connect to my WIFi, which it did but when I went to the home screen, NO NETFLIX was available, Well amazon called and got me through without a problem, then called Netflix to reset my password everything is great", "It was easy to install to my monitor HDMI port using the extender cable that was included with the kit. I needed the extender cable because the HDMI ports on my monitor are inset. So I m glad that the extender cable was included. The instructions that came with it were easy to follow. And for good measure Amazon sent me more instructions via email after I ordered. I have an older gen1 Fire system that connect via cable that I use on our HTS where we have CAT6 installed. But wanted to add Prime video to another set. This works just fine for that, so I gave it 5 stars. I understand that it doesn t have all the bells and whistles, but for what I needed it works just fine.",
"I bought this 3 weeks ago my son finally installed it kids they take forever to do something lol so we had a very old roku box and it started acting up so I got this to replace it. We ve always used roku but decided to go with the firestick. It was easy to set up and boy let me tell ya this thing is super fast compared to our old roku box. I had to tell my son to slow down so I could see what s on the screen lol he was jumping around to different screens and apps so fast. The picture quality is real good also and our tv is about 6 years old. I m thinking about getting another one for my tv upstairs it s a roku tv and works great but it s not as fast as the firestick and doesn t have the voice activated remote which my son really likes with the firestick.",
"I have two t.v.s now and have a Firestick with Alexa that changes the volume and turns the t.v on and off. I thought since this one was made in 2020 it would do the same. I saw the little t.v. icon on the remote and thought that was the button to turn the t.v. off. My bad. It does exactly what it is supposed to do but I feel kinda dumb for thinking this 2020 version would be better than my old one from last year that handles both the volume and the t.v. turning on and off. I guess I have to use two remotes. No biggie.","Just purchased for use with a projector for outdoor family movies. All are working well - both sound and picture. Only disappointment so far is there does not seem to be a supported Xfinity app - anyone know why? I hope this gets added soon so I can watch live TV as well.","Just purchased for use with a projector for outdoor family movies. All are working well - both sound and picture. Only disappointment so far is there does not seem to be a supported Xfinity app - anyone know why? I hope this gets added soon so I can watch live TV as well.","Updated from 2 to 4 stars. I kept the product as I was able to download almost all the TV stations via the app catalog and along with my internet package i can login. Just have to open each app independently depending what i want....end of update Love the product and picture and speed is better than my old roku....HOWEVER it does NOT support Spectrum TV app...so now I either return the fire stick or xcl my Spectrum TV add on service....so aggravated.","With broadcast TV so messed up with series not being done due to Corvid, We brought our first Fire Stick. I m impressed with all the movies and series you can watch. Wish I would have checked this out years ago, but was discouraged with my Vizio smart TV and what little I saw, was not working well. The Fire stick works great with using 5gh on my router that I never used before. My error. Bought one from Amazon for $21.00 and now want a second for my wife s TV. Now priced $8.00 higher than my first purchase. What a rip off. Found another vendor that was selling same product for $22.00 and ordered from them. Amazon ordering direct is just screwing you at an additional $8.00 over the first sale. Also have to delay another Amazon order to meet free shipping.",
"I was skeptical of the Fire TV Stick and if I would use it. It s engineering marvel, why? You can download hundreds of apps which vary depending on your use. I currently use it to view movies, news, weather and access music via YouTube. The remote is easy to use with a quick on-screen menu. The setup was relatively easy, but I m computer guy. The only drawback it, does NOT interface with your TV. So if you want access to hundreds of movies, news, weather and also search the web all for FREE. The exception is the cost of internet (recommend 50 megabits or more) and the Fire TV Stick. I currently pay about $65 a month for internet at 50 megabits. Drop your $250 a month cable bill and use the money to buy new wardrobe, car, vacation fund, bitcoin or start college fund for the kids. I almost forgot to mentioned it comes with ALEXA voice, which works as advertised. 4 stars","This is my first Amazon streaming device and I would say I m decently satisfied with it... I had a Roku stick that I used for my living room TV and was planning on buying another to put in my bedroom but my work ended up giving me an Amazon fire TV stick lite as a Christmas gift. So I moved my Roku stick to my bedroom TV and set up the fire stick in my living room since it was newer. The design and set up of it is obviously different than my Roku but it s still easy to figure out and I like some of the features like the Find function that lets you search for free movies and shows. One downside is that I don t have an Alexa device so that s a whole function of it that I don t use. The only other downsides I ve found is that you have to actually turn on the fire stick after your turn on your TV which is a very minor thing but something that I had to adjust to with switching from a Roku stick. I also have a problem with using Amazon prime video on it because I don t have prime.... I use a family members prime account which was what I was logged into on my Roku, but since I set up the Fire stick with my Amazon account I don t have access to prime.... Other than that, it s a really nice streaming device and I do really like the voice recognition function. I might have to buy an Alexa just so I can hook that up to it as well... Thank you work for the amazing Christmas present.","The product isn’t all bad; it isn’t all good either. I firstly did my research, prior to purchasing. Everything I saw or read made the claim that the only differences between the Lite and Standard fire sticks were found in the remotes and something having to do with Dolby audio settings (not important to me). That turned out to NOT be entirely true. Although slight, the Home page looks different. The panels are set up differently than what we’ve grown accustomed to expect from previous fire sticks. However, they’ve maintained the user-friendliness of the device, making the learning curve manageable. Also, the device has maintained the ability to side load apps from unknown sources. However, although everything works as expected, a couple of the apps fail to display the panel art and therefore remain blank in appearance. To me, these slight variances aren’t much of a big deal. However, if you’re like I am, you appreciate knowing the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, prior to purchasing any product. In my opinion, Amazon fell a bit short, this time, in doing that. Besides the aforementioned, the product serves my purposes. It gets the job done but depending on your personal preferences, you may want to stick to what’s familiar. Besides the lower price, the Lite appears to be void of any advantage over the Standard fire stick we’ve all grown to love",
"When this was <$20 on sale, it s a great deal. Otherwise, it s just Meh with compeition being good options. The reason I say this is for tow reasons: 1st, the included remotes are not great and 2nd, it s just buggy. I d be willing to pay more to get an alumum clad remote that has better feel, something more like what comes with Apple TV. As far as buggy, it constantly drops sound and get s glitchy. No matter the software update, we re lucky to get through a week without having to unplug the power to it and do a clean reboot. Sometimes it s nearly every day. My kids use Prime a lot and I m constantly having to intervene to make it work right is annoying.",
"It works fine, runs much faster than my previous Fire Stick (menus, thumbnails and apps load faster).The battery cover runs nearly the entire length of the remote. Every time I push a button the battery cover flexes considerably, and it feels like I ve inadvertantly opened the battery compartment. Very unnerving. I don t want Alexa in my house. This Fire Stick comes with Alexa, but the product description (or maybe questions/answers?) says that there s a setting to disable Alexa. I could not find that setting. I am now seeing commercials encouraging me to speak into Alexa. So the commercials know that I ve got an Alexa-capable device even though Alexa is supposedly not enabled. I m also now seeing an Alexa app in my suggested apps list. I have no idea what this app might be for. Is it needed for Alexa to work? Does it augment Alexa? Just a lot of sketchy info about a feature I don t want.When I am done watching for the day I put the Fire Stick into sleep mode. I did this with my previous Fire Stick, and it seemed to work as expected. But this new Fire Stick is up and running as soon as I turn my TV on, which makes me wonder if it ever does go to sleep.","Overall I like this product. If you are fanatic about volume, get the other fire stick as the lite stick does not have volume control. I had to set this product up for my parent who is not technologically inclined. Set up was not the issue. Those who have lived 8+ decades with channels and simple on/off features on a television have a hard time understanding apps and the timing of programs -- scheduling. We need it for one program, but then we have to switch back to regular fios/cable for programs/channels that are on television. It would be easier if there was a set channel function within the fire stick of the most watched channels/programs for ease and convenience-- especially for those not app oriented.","Works great and is great for my non-Fire Smart TVs. However, I could not get signed in using my tv provider info for the History Channel app (Spectrum credentials) whereas on my older regular fire stick I was able to sign in fine. I purchased them recently for multiple TVs. The new ones just kick me out and back to Home. Some comments said to do a factory reset but these are brand new so I don t think that is the solution. So I just can t use that particular app on the TVs with the new lite fire sticks. My Fire Remote app on my phone works great with both the old Fire Stick and the new Fire Stick Lites, which is a plus!","I’m not an Alexa-type person so I don’t use it. I have no problems using the remote. One day I’ll use Alexa (but not today). This was my first experience with a Fire Stick so I made some mistakes. This is a ‘lite’ Fire Stick. The remote only works with the Fire Stick. The TV had to be turned off and on manually. I couldn’t figure out how to install the Fire Stick. My friend did the entire installment. There are dozens of movies, TV shows, sports, news etc. This needs internet service. No other service is needed- that alone saves hundreds of dollars. My new TV has the Fire Stick built in. That’s the way to go!","I got this on sale and decided for the price what the heck. I was surprised at the quality of the voice recognition. It was easy to set up the actual unit to the TV. Adding each app took a while to do so set aside some time. You can choose to set up watchlist or libraries. It shows what is currently airing that you may like. It is definitely geared towards Amazon Prime Video consumers but I have multiple apps that I stream quite easily with my fire stick. As a Prime Member you do have access to a lot of included apps. One con is that Sometimes the apps get stuck and no matter what you push on the remote you are dead in the water until the system refreshes. It is not a long time but it is irritating. Otherwise, The remote generally is fast, responsive and easy to use. Yes you can watch local news, most prime time TV shows and then so many other streaming apps are available! Some apps have in ad commercials that you cannot skip but you had to watch commercials paying your internet provider anyway. This fire stick Makes going to bed very hard when you can binge watch about anything you want.","We had an extra tv but no coaxial cable to hook up another cable box and since we stream a few services like Netflix and hbo so we bought this so our 67-year old dad can watch his shows. Very easy to manage but I find myself restarting the fire stick every now and then fue to network disconnection. It’s connected to our 5G and it’s maybe 10 ft away from the router, maybe that’s the issue. I’ll switch it back to our 2G and see if that might solve the issue for a steady connection since 2G is convenient for devices that are long range. Aside from this issue it’s been very simple and easy to manage.","I ve had terrible luck with various previous models constantly disconnecting from my wifi (while no other devices had this issue) and showing the Home is Currently Unavailable error over and over. I couldn t even get through to movie without having to restart my Fire Sticks. I have since moved over to ROKU devices and all has been well. I took the chance at the Fire Stick again because of the sale and so far I haven t had any disconnects. This one seems to be working much better so far. I wish it had the controller the more expensive models do, but whatever, it works. The center select button is very wiggly and making a jiggling clicky noise when you barely touch it, so I m expecting that to stop working eventually. Otherwise, the picture is fine and I don t have any other issues.",
"I bought this to replace an old Roku that was giving me trouble, thought this would be an upgrade. Unfortunately, this is way more of a pain than the Roku has ever been. It almost never wants to play sound, which is incredibly irritating. I have to unplug it and plug it back in constantly, though that doesn’t even work most of the time unless I leave it unplugged for several hours or even days. It’s also a big pain to go back to a show you were watching. You have to click through all the channels, find the show, then try to figure out which one you were watching. It looks like you’ve already watched shows you didn’t see, the line across the bottom shows up on ones you never watched. If you were watching a series, most of the time it will jump several shows ahead so you have to go back and fast fwd through a bunch of episodes to figure out where you were. Sometimes it will randomly start playing in the middle of an episode you haven’t watched when you turn it on. I bought Discovery+ through this and can’t access it through my Roku, so it’s annoying when I want to finish a show but can’t get any sound. With everything technology is capable of these days, it’s amazing that not even the most basic things (like sound) will work. Too late to return it. Glad I at least bought it on sale since it’ll likely end up in the garbage. For now I’m back to using the old Roku as even that works way better than this thing. Extremely disappointing! I will just buy another Roku in the future. The idea and ability to get many different channels is great, if they could only get it to work consistently and fix some of the annoyances. Not worth having to keep unplugging it and plugging it back in several times just to hear the sound. Today I’ve done that 6 times and it still won’t work. At least my Roku plays sound.","I really wanted to like this, and in some ways I do. I got it for an older flat screen in my bedroom to make it a bit smarter and give me some more viewing options. But it has been a nightmare in many ways. First, the sound keeps dropping out. No sound at all on any viewing option or even the menu navigation sounds. Only reliable fix is to reboot the device - and it happens all the time. Amazon tech support couldn t really help me. It also has a cord which is far too short when you are trying to adjust to get a Wi-FI signal. I had to buy a longer one - about 3 feet vs 3 inches. It still didn t solve my problem. The signal fluctuates from good to marginal. Amazon tech support recommended a signal booster which wasn t a booster at all - it was just a longer cable. I did end up having to buy a real Wi-Fi booster - and it has a direct line of sight about 20 feet away from the Firestick. Now my signal strength fluctuates between very good and, wait for it - marginal. There is no option for hard wired ethernet built in - so now a have paid for a $25 piece of hardware, had to add extension cables, Wi-Fi boosters and now another add-on which will let me plug in an ethernet cable. Which I also have to buy and run under and through me house. $25 turned into $500. I could have got a real smart TV for a lot less. It doesn t have nearly enough storage - 8 GB? Really? In 2021? I can get 8 times that much on a thumb drive for under $10, or a 2 TB drive for around $50. It would have been so easy for them to make this product so much better right out of the box (for pennies more) and they didn t. Also, Amazon tech support told me adding wired ethernet won t help, but the Firestick on-screen messages when the signal drops off tells me it should help. (Too bad there is no ethernet port!) I pray that it does help, and that I don t have to reboot this thing every day for the rest of my life just to hear the sound. BTW, my real smart TV in the den receives the Wi-Fi signal from my router with excellent signal strength - and it passes through more wall than the Firestick signal did. The Wi-Fi booster I had to buy gets a strong signal. And the Firestick still keeps losing the signal even now when I have a direct line of sight with the booster. The Firestick itself is the problem.","I have purchased 2 other fire sticks and had no problems. I got this one for my child’s room, and it’s complete trash. I have to unplug and replug the fire stick every time I cut the tv on to get it to turn on. The remote only worked the first 2 days and then was almost unresponsive. I use the fire stick remote app on my phone instead, which I shouldn’t have to do with a new purchase. Buy a more expensive one, this one is not worth it!!","I have used several fire sticks and even bought some for friends and family. When the less then 6 month old one quit working, I went to customer service to see if they could help me figure out why it wasn t working. After leading me through steps I told the customer agent I had already done (so it ended up being done twice) All he could say to me is my warranty is expired. I spend around 100 a month on amazon if the customer service continues to be poor I will have to find a new online realtor.","This was a replacement for my first generation Fire Stick and I was disappointed with it. I decided to upgrade as my first generation would lose connectivity. I received the new Fire Stick Lite and for some reason it would need to be restarted every time I turned on the TV due to there being no sound. I called and spoke to an Amazon Customer Service person who helped by sending me a replacement. That service was amazing! Unfortunately the second one was inconsistent too and I found the same issue. Perhaps it didn t work with my tv? I am returning it.",
"I bought this in hopes of using it instead of our xbox, and there were some apps that were not available on the xbox but were on the fire stick. I am definitely unhappy that we have yet to be able to watch anything on the disney plus app. I have had to restart it a few times in only a couple of weeks because it would not open up my profile and then my husband s profile, then mine again. We also had to restart it because it froze up a couple of times while watching a show.... the voices would continue to play, but the screen froze up. There definitely needs to be some updates or something to fix these issues. One positive is that it was easy to set up.","Bought a fire stick so I can watch all the streaming services I have. Still can’t have them all in one place. They all work great, EXCEPT PRIME VIDEO. I’ve restarted the fire stick and filled out my logins and passwords so many times. I’m over it. That’s obnoxious doing that. Still can’t get it to work. The one time while trying it signed me up for a new prime account and charged me and to get that fixed and my money back took 4 different customer service reps and wasted over an hour of my time. Every person kept telling me they didn’t see the charge and they wanted me to dispute it with my bank. I’m over it. I just want to watch all my streaming services in one place. Was ready to put a firestick on all my TVs, but whats the point? Very frustrating and I’m over it. I’m sure the problem will eventually find a solution some how, but I’m sure I’ll have to do my logins and passwords for the billionth time.","My only complaint for this item is the lack of an on/off button. I bought this as gift for my parents so it was a bit frustrating. Upon setting it up we realized they would need to use the TV remote to turn on and off before using the firestick. Maybe this was mentioned somewhere in the details and I somehow overlooked it? Regardless, the firestick works great but I was hoping to help them eliminate the need for more than one remote.","This Firestick freezes at least once a day and the only way to get it back and rebooted is to pull the power connection out and reinstall it. This is totally unacceptable and I am going to return it to Amazon and choose a new replacement. I have had at least 4 or 5 Firesticks over the years and this is the second one that has had problems. This one worked very up until the time the image froze. Hope I have better luck next one.","Again another half baked idea from Amazon, What good is it if you need two remotes. ( aka TV remote & firestick) to operate your TV. For the price at Best Buy of 17.99 i guess it was worth it verses buying a 1k of 4 new smart TV s. The main problem is going from Hulu, to Prime to Netflix the remote gets stuck and will not let you change services or shows in the middle of a show. You will always have to end an APP and restart surfing otherwise your locked out. Amazon does offer the full remote for $30 but again does the same thing function wise except TV controls are included. Just watch out for all of the add-on s which aren t free and a click of a button and you bought the farm. WARNING KEEP THE REMOTES AWAY FROM YOUR KIDS OR THEY WILL BE BUYING EVERYTHING WITH A CLICK OF A BUTTON AND YOUR CREDIT CARD ON FILE YOUR DONE.","After returning the first one because it permanently froze and would not reset I became frustrated with the replacement when I needed to reset it every few days by unplugging and plugging it in. Other than that it is the same thing less the volume controls.","I bought this because it was on sale. I soon realized that it was on sale for a good reason: it does not have a volume control. Is it crucial to have a volume control to use it? Maybe not. But it makes life a lot easier is it does. Now, every time I use it I have to look for the volume control on the remote that comes with the TV. It just makes it a hassle to use this device. I am not recommending it for this reason.",
"My old fire remote stopped working suddenly. So, I took a chance on this new version. Huge mistake, the interface is terrible, the play button often takes you to the home screen. Plus the old one goes into a landfill. I hate making people rich when they re destroying the very planet we need to survive. Sad shame, all my extra $ goes to buy the same product over & over to fill a landfill & make a rich man richer. Let s find a saner way to live!","I am still disappointed with the quality of the item. I have received two replacement remotes because of defective workmanship. The first remote worked for a year then the it stopped working. The battery compartment was corroded. Amazon replaced with no problem, so customer service is always great. I recently purchased one on black Friday and the remote stopped working after one use. They are mailing another one.","New menu style for the lite version and it sucks, packed with recommended apps and advertisements. Your actual apps are like in a small tiny place that you can barely see, they put the price down but pack it with advertising.",
"Just got it today and it s stuck on Checking for updates. I have been unplugging and plugging back in for the last hour.","I wrote a review giving this three stars. After another couple of weeks I have lowered it. This is a piece of crap. It hardly works and it of poor quality. Buy the regular fire stick. This is garbage.","This device is not compatible with my Insignia television. Every other device requiring an HDMI connection works great. Fire TV Stick Lite does not, I ve been delivered 3 in a week all failed to work.",
"This is the first product I ve reviewed on Amazon. I had a first-generation Fire TV Stick that lasted 5 years, but my wife lost the remote when we moved. I bought this because I don t have a 4K TV, so I didn t need the nicest version. It is a complete piece of crap. With the first one I received, Netflix worked well, but other apps (Hulu, ESPN, FOX Sports, HGTVGO, etc.) experienced issues. I thought I got a lemon, so I requested a replacement. The second one had the same problems. Amazon must have spent no time developing or troubleshooting this device. I m super disappointed and annoyed.",
"This is not my first fire stick. They wanted to send me a refurbished stick to replace my brand new one. Would not replace with a new one. Prices fluctuated since purchase. They said they would look into it and call me back at an agreed upon time. They did not. Very dissatisfied with this purchase. It is like they didn t want to help because I purchased it on sale.","This fire stick has to be rebooted every time it s used (unplug, wait, reenergize) the other fire sticks I have (3) only need the occasional rebooting. Smart tv here I come","No sound, displays a black screen after 5 minutes, can t even open netflix. Im returning this.",
"The firestick constantly has to be unplugged and restarted for it to work and the remote has really poor connectivity - to the point where it s unusable. Nothing is quite as frustrating as standing two inches away from a device and the remote still triggers no action.","I bought this solely so I could listen to audible on my tv, if I had known that I couldn t browse my library and that audible is controlled solely by voice command, I never would have bought it. Besides the audible issue, firestick tv really sucks, it s very chaotic, if you want access to everything, I would save up and get the nvidia shield pro, if you want something close to the best minus hbomax, buy a roku 4. Firestick tv misses the mark on everything.",
"Tv in living room. Had just got cable but didn’t have the channels I wanted without paying some outrageous price. Was recommended by a friend. The video we watch was horrible. Still don’t know all the features because it was hard to follow the video","ordered 2 of these one for each of my kids room both were defected would go to a black screen the back button would stop working and would freeze then asked for a replacement which lately i Been having issues with either receiving my orders or with the workers not knowing what they’re doing and being on the phone for hours back and forth on hold etc. I don’t feel that this is appropriate being a prime member paying all that money for a year either to not receive your order as in it’s saying it’s out for delivery then all of a sudden is marked as undeliverable and being automatically sent back to the seller and being automatically refunded or having defective items and you’re on the phone for hours not happy never had these issues before always loved amazon but then the replacement didn’t Work so yet again had to call Amazon to troubleshoot the replacement so I ended up having to send three fire sticks back yet again be on the phone for a long time frustrated aggravated hopefully this does not continue to happen because this was way too much aggravation and stress that was not necessary and thankfully the few people who I did get in contact with who actually did know what they were doing made it much more easier than dealing with the people who wasted my time and did not know anything",
"My fire stick light didn t work it kept powering off I thought it was the remote or maybe the power wires that came with it so I hooked my other fire stick up to it the old one and it worked perfectly fine with the new power wires and remote so it was the fire stick itself I ve tried calling Amazon but haven t got in touch with them to do a return and I have been too busy this month and with being hospitalized to put that return fire stick at the top of my priorities list.","Been using ROKU s (3) for years. They have become somewhat unreliable. Remotes often go bad and unit also begins to malfunction. BUT it was simple to use as long as it worked. Fire is overwhelmingly complicated compared. Offerings are confusing. Has an universal search that implies somethings are free but they are not - only the app have to pay for a provider. Still learning but wastes a lot of time. Not very intuitive. As you scroll for apps it starts a preview they are pushing right away. Very irritating","Love how durable it is and very portable and I just love it","Perfect. Easy set up. Great picture quality. Extremely responsive. Great WiFi connectivity. I use this in my RV where I used to use an Xbox to run streaming apps. Much lower power consumption and easier navigation. Buy it. Value for dollar one one the best purchases I’ve made in the last year" ]
